The problem is the word they use to refer to love, *Ai*. *Ai* is love, but a type of love that is kinda lost in translation. When we, westerns, talk about love we are generally talking about *koi*, which is a type of love that is kinda selfish, the one you want to stay with that person, a passion. *Ai* on the other hand is kinda a form of admiration/devotion. I will try to illustrate.\n\nIn Kotonoha no Niwa (Garden of words), [Shinkai describe it as a story about love in a japanese manner](https://youtu.be/QzCjr-gJ9k4?t=1m8s) (although I'm fairly certain the translator mixed the meanings). Not giving spoilers about the story but I remember reviews saying this movie wasn't romance and that person kinda had a point as it wasn't about love that we know (*koi*) but when we think about the admiration each of the characters had for the other was something so strong that was able to move both foward, it's kinda a story about love if we think about.\n\nOne example of *Ai* that stood out for my friend that knows this subject better was in Durarara, more specifically about [Seiji Yagiri](http://durarara.wikia.com/wiki/Seiji_Yagiri).\n [Durarara](/s \"He refers to his love for the Dullahan's head as *Ai*, which stood out as a kind of obsession.\")\n\nAnother example that I can give you is in the first season finale from [Gundam 00](/s \", Graham declares his *love* for Setsuna and that has no meaning about staying together but that love/admiration (and kinda hate) is the driving force about all of his changes in character through this finale and Season 2 when he transforms into Mr. Bushido.\") [Link for the spoiler.](https://youtu.be/5zCxzoWkLXM?t=4s)\n\nAlso worth note, the verb in present progressive, meaning it's hapenning now but could imply an indefinite amount of time or something like that, I don't remember all the things my friend said but it could give the meaning of love through time and may be one of the reasons (along with the meaning of koi vs ai) about its (lack of) usage.\n\nAnyone that knows this subject are free to correct me, as I said I don't know much japanese."

He writes whatever comes to his mind when he's not inspired, ergo he writes whatever shit is on his mind without thinking if the readers will like it or if it's actually good. He even admits he's a [noname author](http://i.imgur.com/CQ1Lenf.jpg) in episode 2. Even Sagiri offered her money as illustrator so they can get until the end of the month a couple of episodes back. The manuscript he wrote to challenge Yamada Elf in episode 4 (wich she forfeits on purpouse for obvious reasons) was aimed only to Sagiri, not to a broader audience as a novel should be.\n\nI really don't know what you need to understand that he's having money issues with his poor writting & sales.\n\n>So back to \"boring\", who is saying this?

Even Masamune praises her work. He was speechless when he read the manuscript Yamada wrote for their challenge in episode 4. She's already a writter with 2 million copies sold, way less than Muramasa but a lot more than Masamune wich is the main focus on our discussion. She makes big bucks wheter her works are cheap or not (wich we don't know for a fact yet). The whole discussion is because Masamune isn't selling as much as he should to meet the month's end.\n\n>Essentially, Izumi is \"boring\" because each other scene isn't either action or ecchi.

   "text": "First, granted, I am doing a lot of speculation and assumptions and reading into the interactions a \"lot\" of what I suppose are meant to be allusions to the world of Light Novel literature. This is before I read your post in its entirety and just addressing that right away.\n\nThe numbers are stated in the anime, episode 6 I'm pretty sure lists the 200k number as they boast about sales figures but I'm pretty sure the first or second meeting with Elf-sensei also shows this info.\n\nAs for money issues, I think this is just a general medium to long term issue. Presumably they are living with only minimal assistance from their aunt who doesn't approve of his/their lifestyle. His works sell *well enough in the past* that they do not have financial issues *in the moment* but with his next publication date *in a years time* he can't stretch their income and whatever assistance he does get from their aunt is predicated on him having regular published output. Which his previous series was; and it's implied he's been doing this for years.\n\n> And yet he follows every single instruction from Yamada Elf, from writting only when he's inspired to following every single instruction from Yamada in this episode.\n\nStyle is not the same thing as technical skill at writing. Remember her advice is so Izumi can write *a short story* which has different structure and pacing compared to his regular works; her advice isn't aimed at changing the particular tropes or style he uses, but advice on how to better fit them in an unfamiliar \"packaging\".\n\n> He writes Battle based novels, the most tropey genre there is, and he's not selling those well. Now he's moving to rom-com siscon novels. There's really nothing to call outstanding in neither of those genres.\n\nWe don't know. He obviously adheres to certain tropes, he is a light novel author and by definition trash :D but clearly there is *something* about the way he writes his battle fiction that stands out from Elf Yamada is the point; and has to be mutually exclusive to how Elf Yamada writes her fiction from a perspective of *style*; and our best hint is it has something to do with characterization.\n\nMy best guess is basically along the lines of writing characters that reflect himself, and seem living and breathing. Versus a style where the characters are more designed for big flashy set piece fight scenes or ecchi fanservice. Harry Potter vs Twilight as a very crude and unfair generalization.\n\n> Even Masamune praises her work.\n\nThe inmates are running the asylum, of course he does! \n\n> The whole discussion is because Masamune isn't selling as much as he should to meet the month's end.\n\nMy point here largely that Elf-Yamada could be a silent criticism of the Light Novel industry churning out trash that gets immediate acclaim and anime adaptions because of the sheer trash factor generating huge popularity. :D \n\nRemember here that it is an possibly *erroneous* to assume Sales Figures = Writing Quality. The anime I think is making a very clever bait and switch but is actually lying to us. Throwing around the sales figures and having Yamada stand by them as Objective Measures of Writing Talent when in reality they are probably disingenuous.\n\nIf we actually assume the *opposite*, that the saves figures are not reflective of \"quality\" and considering this is the LN industry... taking place after the industry exploded publishing every webnovel barely legitimately above the level of fanfiction it can grab its hands on... It opens up different possibilities. Elf might instead be a writer of pure unadulterated id; writing pure guilty pleasure fics that keep you reading and engrossed but are really really trash. And maybe this is also muramasa but x10.\n\nThis leaves humble hard working Izumi with his 200,000; sure there's clearly some trash elements; but maybe he actually is legitimately a *good* writer largely written off by the industry at large because he's too slow paced and lacks eye candy? \n\nIsn't it strange that he can write fiction that moves people to tears but is also \"bad\"? This seems strangely inconsistent and I suspect it's deeper than that at first glance.\n\n> That's just YOUR assumption, so it pretty much means squat.

Before all these girls arrived, Tomoe was his only friend so far, since all he does is go to school, take care of Sagiri and the house, and write his novels when he has the time. And that's it, there's no traveling to enrich his view, or meeting different people/cultures outside he's hometown, or even finding out new trends or hobbies to insert into his work.\n\n>Remember here that it is an possibly erroneous to assume Sales Figures = Writing Quality.

Hence why a year is too long, so again, don't accuse me of \"bs\" when you can't get basic facts right.\n\nSecond, his worth ethic isn't stupid; it's different but not stupid. He strongly believes in treating writing *like a job*, like a 9-5 thing; when you're on the clock don't do anything not related to the job other than eating or going to the bathroom.\n\nThis is shown as being an *extreme* that Elf criticizes, since she views it as a creative thing you need to have motivation, passion, and creativity bursting at the seams to do, basically a hobby where you have bursts of inspiration and do whatever you need to do to recharge between \"sprints\" of inspiration like in SCRUM programming paradigms. HOWEVER, she is also an extreme, she procrastinates and doesn't have happy editors. Her brother literally sends in \"goons\" to get her to sit down and work, editors have long term planning to know when they have content to publish in magazines and can't just rely on their authors giving them stuff at the last moment. Plus they want to have excerpts ready to tease the product; and prefer to have editors proof reading and *actually editing* on a regular basis; they really don't want to hear \"Sorry got nothing yet, but believe me I'll have something by the due date!\" Sorry, the real world doesn't work like that.\n\n*Neither of them* are presented as being correct; but have pros and cons to their work ethic.\n\n> Obviously you as the employer won't pay a dime.

You're point was \"self inserts are inherently bad\", you don't understand the basic fact is what makes self inserts bad is when they become Mary Sue's; they are not inherently bad but instead serve a valid literary role; they are a tool. And tools can be abused, you have zero indication that this is the case here, you're just spouting nonsense.\n\n> Hah, so now you're implying Masamune's cheap shitty battle stories are complex and hard to understand? oh boy, let me go off to the terrace and laugh out loud so you don't be offend by how farfetched and dumb your assumptions sound.\n\nYou aren't responding to the argument at hand, but continue to spout idiotic drivel.\n\n> But you're inclined to make asspulls how glorious Masamune's writting might be, and totally ignore that he's more interested in building a character based on aestethics than actual characteristics, traits and personality that make characters real.

Hint, it often involves creating narratives based on circumstantial or even faulty evidence to craft an engaging metanarrative about the work, even if there are some facts that may counteract it; this is because artistic works are complex and very often analysis attempts to simplify it down relying on not entirely sound generalizations based on references.\n\nYou may not *like* the idea that I am positing, that Masamune is actually probably a much better writer than the show intends to display (and thus Elf and Muramasa are likely worse); but the show doesn't actually decisively refute this; but instead has certain deceptive red herrings that could be reasonably interpreted to imply the opposite. You haven't actually refuted this thesis by claiming \"bs\", personal subjective opinions, or getting basic facts wrong.\n\nSo try again, or cry in a corner."

But hey, whatever, she wants to crush the MC's dream so we're going to get some good introspection and work right? The Senpai author is going to tell him in the office why she wants to crush his dream, right?\n\nNope. Instead, we cut to their house and get a  30 second montage showing a stack of paper three times and Elf in a couple different outfits giving some pointers. Lazy, fine, cool. Then the Senpai shows up for the purpose of antagonizing the MC and wants him to be her private writer and will pay all his bills. Oh, turns out she loves his books and they're the only perfect book out there for her?\n\nLike, really? I understand this show is just the author patting himself on the back, but this level of self-congratulations is bordering on masturbation.\n\nAnyways, we get to the confession scene, and boy howdy. I'm guessing this was supposed to be a scene where we're all supposed to look at Sagiri and be happy(?) that she came out of her room and confessed her love? Except this whole sequence just comes off as so...cringey. It's BAD. You have a character you introduced this episode confessing love and admiration halfway in, and then the \"shut in\" sister coming out and doing the same, with dramatic music playing trying to make it seem like some impressive feat. All it does is come off as trying way too hard and has the opposite effect.\n\nThe rest of the episode doesn't matter. There's a literal bench confession with the Senpai where he says he loves someone, and then the figurative confession with his story title with his \"sister\".\n\nI will say, I do enjoy hate watching this, but I wanted to point out how badly this episode botched that whole sequence. It just doesn't work at all."
