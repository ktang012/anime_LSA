If there was any hope for a show where spring and gear driven devices would be a huge part of it, then surely a show named and about clockwork would be it... and thats where the disappointment, and following that the dislike, comes from. To be more specific, pretty much none of the \"clockwork\" has been show to have any clear purpose, and has only existed for the sake of existing and calling it clockwork. That's not to say every gear needs to be explained, but it would be nice to see them work together in a specific device to accomplish a specific task in a way that, while it can break some laws of physics if need be, is still believable, rather than what currently happens in the show where the overwhelming majority of gears just constantly spin around without any viewable results or explanations, and of those that do get a reason/explanation, its typically some overtaken by some absurdity."

   "text": "IDK why, but when RyuZU mentioned how many gears she had, I immediately went for some math. Most estimates put the number of cells in average adult human at somewhere around 40 trillion. She has about 4 trillion gears comprising her body, meaning each gear is on average 10 times larger than a human cell. Cells can vary quite a bit but I went with an average diameter of about 20 micrometers (a red blood cell is about 10 micrometers). Meaning the average gear in her body is probably somewhere around 0.2 mm in diameter. I couldn't find any concrete info about the smallest gear ever made but it looks like nanotechnology research has made some as small as 8 micrometers in diameter.\n\n\nSo basically, the number wasn't necessarily totally random, but Y is still basically a magician. Not to mention Naoto and Marie for being able to fix her after she punched a hole through herself (or she was just super precise when doing so). Still an entertaining show even if the best pat of it was dead for half the episode. "

They played it again in this episode.\n\nFor Marie it wasn't anything really special because she knew what she was doing, and we saw that she's not only a good commander but also very competent by herself and passionate about her task. This is reflected in the trust people have in her (or fear for that annoying guy with the military), but also how Naoto, someone who's shown he doesn't take being ordered around well, accepts her directives without discussions.\n\nFor Naoto, he wanted to avoid the responsibility of 20 million lives, but he looked both [embarrassed and happy](https://i.imgur.com/vY1k5Qj.jpg) when he was credited for saving them. And I might be imagining things (because he was worrying about RyuZU), but I feel like he was actually [disappointed](https://i.imgur.com/PsDDuIE.jpg) that this credit was taken from him right after.\n\nI really love those details in characterization.

I too like to be jaded as fuck and take only half sentences out of context as quotes to support my own argument.\n\n---------------------\n\n> Typical guy. *\"Muh anime doesn't get credit for being fun, so I'll say it's not generic\"*\n\n~~It's my lowest rated show of the season at 6/10~~ 7/10. If you can say it's generic you might as well call everything else generic as in \"has main characters. and plot. and other people. also features breathable air. 10/10\"\n\n> You obviously never watched old school anime like Saber Marionette, Onegai Teacher, Chobits, Sora no Otoshimono and dozens of other titles with the overused formula of loser guy gets a waifu for free. Specially Saber Marionette & Chobits whose waifus are mechanical.\n\nUsing your logic, purely because it uses that overused formula roughly 40% of all anime must also be shit. Also \"old school\"? Dafuq? Those were all made after 2000. And have at least a 7/10 on MAL. Total shit right? \n\nLet's say Clockwork Planet is generic. Then Sword Art Online is generic *out the ass* with \"trapped in a video game, die in-game die in real life, super OP edgy protagonist dressed in all black who is cookie-cutter generic\" but it's still near top of the charts and A-1 rolled in so much dough they couldn't care less if the show is generic, nevertheless it was fucking enjoyable. In Mirai Nikki, loser MC underdog basically gets his waifu handed to him on a silver platter during the beginning of the show. *Definitely* 100% shit amirite. KonoSuba fits your description as well.\n\n> You call around 30 to 40 peeps a lot? compared to a population of at least 2000 users in this sub? lol talk about turning a blind eye.\n\nRead: ***existing*** *comments* \n\nThere are nearly 500,000 subscribers in this subreddit with at least 2500 active at any given time. Apparently any post that doesn't receive at least that number of comments must be shit because it's  not popular.\n\nYou must ride the popular anime bandwagon and get free karma because almost no one will dislike those anime. And that must make you an authority figure on anime quality. Give yourself a pat on the back.\n\n> You don't think an OP main that can slice & dice enemies without even getting a scratch isn't generic? or how about a couple of humans against several squads of robots getting shot at but never being hit nor scratched in a tunnel with no covering. How about the male MC being the underdog, but it's the only one that can save a whole city of 20 million habitants.\n\nYeah the combat is shit, but the story and characters are fine. You think you can build a story where literally anyone, even the janitor of the building can fix the problem? No. You need to put relevance into the MC instead of him being involved purely because of him owning RyuZU. They were literally planning to kill MC because he was worthless when they met. MC is a clock/mechanical enthusiast and has a gift pertaining to that. \n\n> Like eeeeeevery other waifu anime I mentioned before. Yeah, sure, your title reeks of originality there mate.\n\nI'm not saying it's original. Try again. This show has its own flavor to separate it from other anime. Additionally, MC gave no shits about the 20M people and would've rather run away. RyuZU basically killed herself to convince him to fix it. Any anime that has a similar formula to another anime must clearly be shit. The same applies to any sort of entertainment- movies, TV, music, etc. \n\n> How does that foot in your mouth tastes huh?\n\nPlease try again with the full context.\n\nAs beach episode on *a planet made of fucking gears* is enough to make anyone, even those who haven't see it before, interested as in \"how the hell does that work\"\n\n--------------\n\nYou must have a great time objectively reviewing anime one frame at a time other than judging based on if it's enjoyable or not; the kind of person who prides themselves being the only person to know the absolute best of everything and no one is allowed to like anything else. You must be the life of the party.\n\n\nI'm trying to give readers a chance to watch this series on the chance that *they* like it. (It seems it's a bit late for that with the 3 episode test.) There are other less popular anime that even with its drawbacks I happened to enjoy and even rate higher than the popular ones. Yeah I rate shows based on enjoyability and not every damn component of making an anime, sue me. Less seasoned anime watchers are easily swayed by jaded and cynical asshats that assume authority and dismiss anything that doesn't meet their personal standards."
