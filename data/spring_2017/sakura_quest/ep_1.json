   "text": "What I like about the show is that it presents the things how they are. If I were to visit the concert of my favorite band, I wouldn't really care where it takes place - I would only care for the live event itself. The concert was a small burst to bring money to the town, but it definitly won't have lasting effect because people weren't intereted in visiting it in the first place. \n\nThe TV show, again, accomplished its goals - got the rating among the viewers and presented things in a \"dramatic\" fashion. Who cares about the town itself anyway? It's boring. No one would watch that kind of program. I know I wouldn't. \n\nUltimately, the concert was not a wrong decision, but not a correct one either - more like a wasted chance. Will see how the events proceed from there. Where Yoshino is heading anyway? I doubt she gave up so easily and is going home. "

   "text": "Just as some peeps pointed out last episode, the followers of the Ptemayo band were only interested in the live concert. It breaks our hearts to see all the effort from Yoshino tachi going down the drain. Sure they even filled the yearly quota of visitors in a single event (heh, I had flashbacks from Amagi Brilliant Park) but it sucks that only a small number of visitors actually managed to use the coupons everyone worked so hard to produce, along with their own event wich was stolen by the concert. Not saying the guys doing the live concert are the villians, it just sucks how the events screwed over the locals.\n\nA bit of unrelated rant. I've lived in my hometown for around 30 years, and even though it's a small city unlike Manoyama's rural settlement, I experience in first hand in the last two years, the sad reality of watching [small comerce](http://imgur.com/52SZ7le.jpg) stablishments being closed for good due to the economy and high crime rate. And that makes me worry what will happen in the next few years when the main income in my city isn't enough to even keep the big chain stores running.\n\nAside from the bitter outcome, there were tons of funny shots in this episode. [Riri](http://imgur.com/IGcENmW.jpg) just loves to steal the shots from the rest of the girls lately.

For an anime adaptation for a manga/LN, you'll simply see the name of the original work and the author's name. For example, here's [the credit in Maid Dragon's OP,](http://i.imgur.com/dMJk8bO.jpg) which lists the name of the manga, the author (Cool Kyou-shinja), and the magazine it's serialized in.  Similarly, [KonoSuba](http://i.imgur.com/SVz49Y0.jpg) has credits for \u539f\u4f5c (Natsume Akatsuki, the LN writer) and \u539f\u4f5c\u30a4\u30e9\u30b9\u30c8 (Kurone Mishima, the LN illustrator) as well as the serial publication.\n\nBy contrast, anime-original [Neon Genesis Evangelion](http://i.imgur.com/Hkesx1N.jpg) simply credits \"GAINAX\" for both Original Work and Planning (\u4f01\u753b, *kikaku*), and [Hanasaku Iroha](http://i.imgur.com/HqAiL2Q.jpg) credits \"P.A. Works.\"  But here's the real money shot: another P.A. Works original title released after Hanasaku Iroha, [Shirobako](http://i.imgur.com/FcNmXSL.jpg), credits \u6b66\u8535\u91ce\u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u30fc\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3 (Musashino Animation)...which is the name of the in-universe studio the show follows.  So, nothing weird going on\u2014just a more interesting way of crediting the writers than putting the name of the studio there.\n\n(if you want to learn more about anime credits, check out [this great post](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5ytpxs/ever_wanted_to_know_what_the_text_in_anime_opeds)!)\n\n---\n\nEDIT: Fixed link for Hanasaku Iroha."

Just seems to weird to me.\n\nI live in the San Francisco Bay Area, and from what I've seen, the busy-ness of a downtown district (or any shopping destination) seems to draw on a bunch of factors. The worst is San Jose, a major metropolitan city/area that has 1 million+, but with a 'downtown' that is desolate on the weekends, unless an event is happening. It's very much like what they showed in this last episode, where the crowd swells and then vanishes depending on what events are happening.    \n\nI still feel much of the issue of not believing there's 50k in Manoyama is that the storytellers kept their scene and shot selection tight. I think there was an episode where Yoshino and/or her crew were supposed to explore but I remember feeling like that didn't reveal much, and I just assumed Mayonama was tiny. Usually montages are used to help expand a story's world, but I didn't get a sense that this place had 50k.    "

(And which the BakaTest trap himself is named after)\n\nWhile not a pre-requisite, just having some rudimentary knowledge of the Sengoku Period (i.e. Rise of the Tokugawa Shogunate) and Bakumatsu Period (aka the Meiji Restoration) in Japanese history goes a long way to understanding many of these historical references in anime, as these two periods are easily the most popular and romantic, with tons of manga, anime and games based on them.\n\nJust my two cents."

I'm ready to see how smart and strong our women have grown to surpass their big hurdle in the way.\n\nAaand, this week's name.\n\n**Ep 13: The Marionette's Banquet**: Not as fantasy-ish as the other names, but definitely significant. Broadly speaking, our women's efforts into the festival (patronised by the *Moving Mountains* show) were stimulated by the TV show's bosses and money, and eventually the whole footage was *manipulated* for the   channel's profit. So, the Manoyamans were like the show's \"marionettes\". With \"Banquet\" it is meant some kind of reward, or profit in this case. It's a very strong episode name because it states how you reap what you sow. Although putting all their efforts, illusions and joy into the festival, the reward, looking as a success at first (banquet), is ephemeral because the great profiter was the TV show (the puppet master) and not the Manoyamans who did the dirty job (the marionettes)."
