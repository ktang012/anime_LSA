I was actually surprised when they actually panned to her face and even had HanaKana reprising her role! \n\nWhile no Kirino cameo, [they actually did reference her this episode.](http://i.imgur.com/gsxO0MY.jpg) Though I doubt non-fans of the show noticed that.\n\n[Dengeki Bungko](http://i.imgur.com/ylt0Gw2.png) [is going all out](http://i.imgur.com/ysH5bwB.png) [with these cameos.](http://i.imgur.com/itz6Rwq.png) Didn't expect that the next time I'll hear Holo speak is on Eromanga-Sensei.\n\n---------------------------------------\n\n\nAnyway as for the show itself it's starting to get a lot better with the fanservice. Although that endcard is probably be the downfall of discussion in this thread.\n\nI'm really having a hard time on how Masamune sees Sagiri. He clearly loves him but he's still showing restraint and just wants to be a family while Sagiri shows that she actually want to be in a different relationship with him. [I seriously hope that line from her in the end gets through his head and understands what she wants.](http://i.imgur.com/4zLgc64.png) \n\nAt the end of the day I guess Masamune is just lonely. He's lost people dear to him and now it's just him and Sagiri. He even mentions that if he could he wants Elf to be his Onee-chan. It's actually kinda sad when you think about their situation."

We finally saw more of Sagiri's normal side and she's able to actually yell over the top of her lungs when people bother her.\n\nSagiri's reactions when Masamune was saying she is his no. 1 were super cute as well, although he committed a major fuck up comparing her to Muramasa, that's just a no-no.\n\nThis wasn't really explained in the anime but Kunimitsu actually doesn't know Eromanga-Sensei's true identity and believes he's a man, this will cause some certain funny scenes later on.\n\nAll in all I think it was a seriously enjoyable episode, and I'm happy that next week we are finally getting to the ~~beach episode~~ Fairy Island arc which is tons of fun and has excellent character development."

   "text": "> wait a minute, what are you talking about dude? For 1, Spice and Wolf was made back when Brains Base was still churning out great shows.\n\nSuch as? The only notable shows that have good quality during that time I see is Boccano and Durarara.  I also like Natsume, but it's unremarkable in terms of animation or execution, mainly due to VAs and story.\n\nI dont see the point comparing it to A-1 during that time, cuz it was just starting out and is much younger than Brain's Base. But they still made Black Butler, Exorcist, FairyTail, Working. All were pretty big hits, even though i haven't watched FairyTail or Working. They made other shows like Birdy Decode and Senjou no Valkyria (which i havent seen), though i dont have knowledge about their quality or popularity. And i dont care if you like these shows or not, so don't even start.\n\n>its because they are a large studio who outsource\n\nthat is industry standard and A-1 does it well. Those that don't are exceptions, and may still outsource some stuff. So it's completely moot point.\n\n>and their quality is extremely inconsistent.\n\nRegardless of whether you like the shows, the genre of those shows or the stories they adapt - Eromanga Sensei, Saekano and Granblue are high quality shows. In fact they are some of the highest quality this season. If we look just a little back, we have BlackButler, Sword art online movies, Exorcist, Occult nine were all good quality. That's pretty consistent quality if you ask me, how you go from that to \"extremely inconsistent\", but I'm sure watching digibro doesn't help in that regard.  \n\nAnd this is impressive given their quantity, but its not like its the same people being ran ragged to produce all the anime, they just manage a lot more people and teams, and hire a ton of talented people.\n\n>Also who the hell are you to make that claim about me? I'm a Digi fan who hates A-1? Sure I watch a lot of Digi's videos, but I would hardly say I agree with the guy that often.\n\nI'm making assumptions ofcourse, but i've seen a lot of posts from you here or youtube, most which was about how right digi is an defending him from his critics and people who dont like his content.\n\n>They fucking make like 3-6 shows per season on average.\n\nit would be correct to say 3 on average. Not 3-6 - that's not how you say average.  \n\n>Most good studios make 1 per season, 2 on rare occasions.\n\nyou cant say \"most 'good' studios\" , you haven't established what's good or made a good argument why A-1 isn't good, and the others are. I dont have statistics though, so maybe \"most studios\" would be correct. But that doesn't speak at all for quality of their shows.  \n\nIs Eromanga, Granblue or Saekano lower quality than other shows this season? Not really no, and many of them are significantly lower quality.\n\nI'll assume you think this show is bad, especially when you rub your face in Digibro and you are watching for \"its so bad is good\" or \"its fun to shit on things\" which is a popular things among digi fans. Yeah its still assumptions, but i dont think i'm too far off.\n\nLike really, just like u/coenraed, pretty much the only things you've said relating to eromanga on the sub was making few remarks with no substance and defending digibro and arguing with his critics, that's it. Hence, my almost rhetorical question \"why you're here\" - do you have an interest in this anime, or you just wana shit on it or laugh at people watching it?\n\nP.S And pls don't say \"i dont agree with guy that often\" when your posts reflect the opposite, It's also not all that different with you when it comes to SAO or asterisk - also completely convinced its shit as an absolute fact, and try to communicate that to others while defending digibro.  I know you'll hate this but I dont think its unreasonable to assume youre digi's fanboy, since that's what i see in your posts. You seem to love his stuff, and god forbid people think his videos are too long, or makes too long series to get to the point, all his words are of great value and importance, right?"

They are on upper tier. They aren't kyoani that do high quality always, but they are exception not the rule. This season eromanga sensei, Granblue and Saekano, are HIGH quality, regardless of whether you like those type of shows. Given the quanitity, the quality is actually impressive in those shows, and it's relatively consistent. You'd be much better off adapted by A-1 than brain's base today. They have the money and connections and can assemble great team of people to do an amazing adaptation. Let's try to stick to facts. \n\nHow far do you need to look to find low quality show from A-1? The worst i watched recently was Qualidea Code, because of really bad animation and rushed, everything else was okay though.  \n\nShows such as Asterisk (that im sure nobody like among digi fans, cuz digi) is actually decent quality, it had some really well animated battle scenes especially in second cour, it was no worse than Rakudai Kishi.\n\n>As for why we are here, we are here to share our views, just like everyone else. If you were thinking of saying 'if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all', that phrase is anti-intellectual, counterproductive, and way more toxic to internet communities than most criticism.\n\nI see a couple of people who come here just to shit on the show or A-1, or be like \"i'm watching this cuz digi makes funny podcast and its fun to shit on it\" - now that is toxic behaviour that you disguise as 'criticism' and pretend to be intellectual as you do this. \n\nSee how quickly you jumped on me even when I didn't even reply to you, you werent being productive, you made a pointless, sarcastic remark with no substance.  \n\nI didn't actually assume anything about you since i didn't reply to you, even didn't detect your sarcasm initially. But it was easy to confirm based that you're indeed a digibro fan, and my assumptions fit you well.\n\nThese 2 posts were the only posts you've made on eromanga-sensei discussion threads, the rest are in thread for digis podcast focused on defending digibro and showing how amazing he is.\n\nSo i'll try to repeat original question- do you watch eromanga-sensei? Do you like it? Do you want to contribute to discussion, have you? \n\nYou've said two things - digibro is great and A-1 sucks, basically, then you say shit like \"phrase is anti-intellectual, counterproductive, and way more toxic to internet communities than most criticism.\" A bit ironic if you ask me.\n"

It's more like expressing something negative was basically your agenda regarding this show like most of digibros fanbase. You weren't ever planning on saying something positive about it from episode 1 or 2 , and it's episode 8 now. Hell, you likely assumed it would be bad before you watched it, just like digibro.\n\nIt's like digibro tribe, who like to \"shit on things\" and go into other communities to shout about how shit certain things, such as SAO or asterisk wars, and A-1 is. It's like .... we already know digi doesn't like it, nor his fans. If the well known fact that he hates A-1 wasn't enough, then his best guy whatever videos made it obvious enough.   And then those ppl come into discussions of shows they dont like from studio they dont like and act like intellectuals by spouting one liners and making fun of the show. How is that a good thing? If anything, it's obnoxious.\n\nThere has almost never been anything healthy about digifans shitting on sao or asterisk, i can hardly call it genuine criticism.  \n\nAnd i dont think its unfair of me to ask what intentions they have bothering with the show and whether they have an original argument.\n\n>Your claims about A1's quality are entirely you own opinion though, so 'let's stick to facts' is not valid.\n\nit's not just my opinion, it is a consensus. And it's clear to sakuga enthusiasts. How else do you measure \"quality\" and what does your claims about quality even mean then? What connection is there between quantity and their quality? If quantity affected quality for A-1 then it would show in animation. So are any of the airing A-1 shows have subpar animation? It's pretty great, actually. Show me a reasonable person who does not think so.  \n\nIf you are going to make such claims as you have about it there needs to be some kind of methodology and substance behind it, otherwise its meaningless, and if that's the case then i think its fair if  i assume your arguments would be something as bad as comparing it to mcdonalds. I hope you've at least seen canipa videos on A-1, because it's important to know how they *really* work, whereas Digi often just pulls assumptions out of his ass, to further his agenda, and digi fans take them as a fact.  \n\n> it was meant to explain to the viewers why Digi drops so many shows\n\nbased on a few hundred comments i've seen, that is definitely not the main reason most people watch those. I also doubt digibro refers to those shows as merely \"mediocre\".\n"

The poor guy knows stuff now.\n\nGood Guy Shidou apart, the way Sagiri could easily get out of her room when noone was around tells a lot about how ~~most of~~ Hikkikomori's minds work. She just turned the whole house in her own *room*, so she was still closed in. Interesting.\n\nI had doubts about who the best girl is ~~Now is Kuroneko~~ but this episode made it clear, Elf FTW, that goth loli kimono, 14/10. \n\nVery funny episode! Waiting for more! "
