If you can dehumanise someone so easily yourself, you're probably not on the best path either.\n\nIt's less relevant for most people because they'll never get the power to act on their beliefs, but everything he's saying has the potential to influence Sana. This sort of thing takes me out of the story because I expect that in-story it's the correct thing to say without any negative consequences, but if it wasn't a constructed narrative with certain themes in mind, it wouldn't be so simple.\n\nNaturally it's just setting up the standard dichotomy where real humans, including an organisation full of people without powers, act \"inhuman\", while someone more classically not-human due to their origins or abilities acts more in line with being a \"good person\" who should be welcomed into society. I'm okay with that aspect, but I'd rather they frame it more like \"if a human can shoot a child then there is something more important than 'humanity' to aspire to\" or something."

We are social animals who are developed to recognise emotions and body languages. When we recognise fear, we usually stand down, because it's more harmful to both the party involved when it continues. This ability continued into the days guns are developed. I don't remember where, but I read that only 2 % of the WW1 veterans killed majority of their intended targets, including the all famous British rifleman.\n\nIt's only a recent thing we have developed the capability to train reflex to shoot before recognising fear. In the book \"what's it's like to go to war,\" it's been said that they train you to not think of the enemy as humans, and to force you to heavily rely on adrenaline and dopamine to keep your mind off of the war when you're not in mission.\n\nSo civilisation is the reason we kill.

In the second episode, when Sana cut to her backstory, of how she learned language, got a name, and the like, the person narrating was the lady with the flowers in this episode. \n\nThis is purely my speculation, but there's two ways I interpret this, 'future', Sana:\n\n* She is really Sana from the future, who shouldn't really meddle with the present because of time paradoxes (she does mention that she shouldn't talk to present Sana), but in these moments of dire consequences tries to get present Sana to think of the important matters (What is *human*? What is *identity*?).\n\n* She is an idealized future form that present Sana subconsciously wants. Deeply rooted inside Sana is the desire for normality, for a future in which she works as a florist. Which is to say Sana is a very powerful being with boundless wisdom who has yet to 'mature' from this innocent and underdeveloped state.\n\nThe fact that future Sana is working with flowers is a very nice touch, in that it can either mean that is the future she's destined to live or the idealized life she wants to live. \n\nMinnie C really DGAF, and truly sees Sana as something inhuman, as apparent by the fact she shoots her in the leg with absolutely no remorse. I found it strange though, that she allowed Zouroku to continue his talk with Sana when his intentions are clearly against her wishes. Still, that could mean that Minnie C isn't a bad individual, that she doesn't really want to harm an innocent, old man^(She could've used her hairy husband arm powers to shut him up gently though...).\n\nAll in all, interesting episode.

It gives you the certainty that she will learn the traits of being a florist and follow on Zouroku's steps (he's probably gone by then) but it's pretty touching from that point he'll leave a legacy on Sana.\n\nEdit: now that I think about it, the older self is still Sana in the present projecting herself who does she want to be. She pretty much choose her ruffle dress in the 1st episode based on the knowledge she's adquired from the books the twins gave her. She looks at Zouroku as a good example of what good people stand up for, so it's not so farfetched that older self is just her subconcious telling her what she should do with her life.\n\n[](#schemingsaten)\n\nIt's a shame it's only going to be 12 episodes. I hope that the last episode is a 1 hour special just like the first episode, otherwise at the pace the show has been going it might feel a bit rushed or skimped by the end.\n\nThis title along with Sakura Quest & Re:creators are probably the best non sequel of the season so far."

   "text": "Occam's Razor suggests that the woman she met was indeed Future Sana - that off-hand comment about her boobs is pertinent because that's her future self she's talking to! Hence why 'you'd better not forget you said that, I'll knock you for a loop'. That's the sort of line one says to their past self. There's other stuff too like 'I shouldn't be telling you this', which is another line often said by future selves to prevent paradoxes. But I suppose there's no fear of that since Sana can literally rewrite stuff that happens to her.\n\nAnyway I thought the plot had been rather boring so far, but the twist brought the story back to the kind of sci-fi I like - far more interesting than as an excuse for futuristic/magical action. \n\nEven if a WMD looks, acts, and talks like a little girl, Zouroku is still going to keep it, because the weapon does not have feelings of malice. This is particularly pertinent - the group who wish to harness the power of the Dreams of Alice are particularly dastardly not because they believe Sana has the potential to cause mayhem, but because they plan to use Sana for such acts anyway. Not letting Sana out is merely an excuse for them to justify their ultimately cruel actions, both towards the Dreams of Alice (who are particularly human-like even if they aren't human) and the inevitable chaos which would ensue with a new energy source; just look at the furore over nuclear power. The Dreams of Alice can be used for both good and evil, but the main point is that it will not be good or evil on its own, only the wielder. Minnie C. and her group fail to realise this, and only view Sana as a tool of mayhem because of it. Most of the commotion she caused was due to the group pursuing her using brute force in the first place. Also, see \n\nAlso, with this added information, and the OP showing two Sanas melding into one, a plot involving another Sana seems very possible. Supposedly Future Sana *is also a florist*, something which might happen if Sana does live with Zouroku. I don't know and please don't spoil me if you do. "

I liked her before but this episode cemented it when she broke Sana out.\n\nThe woman Sana saw is probably her older self but I wonder if she got her appearance from Zouroku's daughter/Sanae's mother (referring to the photograph they were showing in episode 2). We don't know the details yet but we do know Sana saw a Dream of Alice go haywire and turn into something non-human. Could that have been Sanae's mother whose appearance she adopted as part of her reaching into the thoughts of people around her and making them reality?\n\nWell that's just my crackpot theory.\n\n"

I also liked Minnie C's behavior when restraining her and blindfolding her, I felt her behavior was very military like for the situation, shooting her in the leg because she cant see what is happening just to show that she can shoot Zouroku. I did not like her induced stupidity when Zouroku started his monologue.\n\nPersonally I liked Sana's behavior during the whole kidnapping, it was unpleasantly authentic I think."

She is not human, so she can be an adult and a child at the same time.\n\nI still can't trust Naito."
