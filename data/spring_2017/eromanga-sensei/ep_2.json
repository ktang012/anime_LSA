He obviously gave a lot of thought to Sagiri and probably Elf as well, but otherwise the other characters are extremely boring.

Or maybe the problem is more on the execution, since this is just a 12 episode anime, there were characters introduced and doing love confessions with little time to develop them beforehand, lowering the overall impact of the confessions."

   "text": "Oh wow, just when we thought the Akihabara scenes were being generous with the Oreimo Easter Eggs, they gave us the biggest of them all with the cameo of the entire main Oreimo cast. I can die happy now. :D\n\nOther Oreimo Easter Eggs:\n\n- 19:38 Both siblings going \"AKI-HA-BA-RA!\" outside the station is a shot-by-shot re-enactment of Kirino's own excited exclamation in Oreimo season 2 episode 1.\n\n- 19:48 Kirino holds a Merurun gacha toy. [In the background](https://i.imgur.com/dVoZ1vC.png), the guy with the bobcut is Mikagami, Kirino's model friend that Kyousuke mistook for her boyfriend.\n\n- 19:50 The [same maid cafe maid from Oreimo](https://i.imgur.com/Azb0pXf.png) offering Masamune an omelette rice labelled \"Onii-chan Daisuki!\" (Though it seems Sagiri knew nothing about it judging by her reaction)\n\n- 19:58 As Masamune windowshops at one of the electric stores, a bunch of people are seen jogging. They're none other than Miura, President of the Games Research Club at Kyousuke and Kuroneko's school, followed by the two chubby twin members of said club. \n\n- 20:01 Two other members of the Games Club, [Makabe (the guy) and Sena (the red-hair glasses girl)](https://i.imgur.com/Y0lUl7M.jpg) are seen dating on the bridge. Also of note is that Makabe was also voiced by Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, Masamune's VA.\n\n- 20:03 Kirino's friend Kanako's career as the idol Kana is still quite popular in Akihabara.\n\n- And finally the main cast of Oreimo reviews (and trashes) Masamune's new LN. And of course, Kyousuke's VA Nakamura Yuuichi doubles as Masamune's dad this episode as well.\n\nUnrelated trivia: Masamune's dad is seen reading a volume of Index, who is voiced by Iguchi Yuka, who voices Sagiri's mom this episode."

There's a bubble coming from the laptop with scribbles.  This usually indicates anger or negative emotions of some sort.  She definitely heard it but they were going through a montage so I guess they didn't have enough time."

At the end of this season (next episode), while reminiscent on their past, and trying to make Sagiri get over it, they return to her old house just to discover a secret trapdoor that leads to a basement where they discover other dead clones of Sagiri/mom, and alongside with it, a note from the mom telling to whoever finds it, that she was abducted and forced to participate in inhumane and horrible project of a resurrected Unit 731 sponsored by the government. Next season is about Sagiri's new self discovery as a human clone, Masamune's coping with the fact that the love of his life is not a human, and their fight against the government and search for her mother while trying to cope with the schedule and work for their new anime.

   "text": "Holy Shit! The amount of cameos this episode is just amazing! Of course they start out by basically doing the same thing Kirino does whenever she's in [A-KI-HA-BA-RA!](https://streamable.com/21szy) | [OreImo Version](https://streamable.com/3crjn)\n\n* [Mikagami!](https://i.imgur.com/dVoZ1vC.png)\n* [Kirara still working at the Pretty Garden Cafe!](http://i.imgur.com/cYYSQHH.png)\n* [Computer Club Presindet Miura!](http://i.imgur.com/jKmM5xN.png)\n* [The Computer Club Twins](http://i.imgur.com/nP7JTGy.png)\n* [Sena and Kaede on a date!](http://i.imgur.com/jhTp2IL.png)\n* [Kana still cosplaying as Meruru!](http://i.imgur.com/LzNKl2S.png)\n* [And of course the main cast together again! <3](http://imgur.com/a/nsHwZ)\n\nRough day to be an Ayase fan though, looks like she got shafted and didn't even get to do a voiceless cameo. Then again I bet she's willing to do a cameo but with the amount of projects she takes on every season she probably couldn't make it :(\n\nBesides the OreImo cameos though this was a pretty good episode. We finally got to see Sagiri and Masamune's motivations on why they do what they do right now. Poor Masamune though, thinking that the girl he use to chat back then was a college student. No wonder he couldn't figure out  that person's identity to this day.\n\nSagiri's mom was just awesome. Looks like we know where [Sagiri got her pervy tendencies.](http://i.imgur.com/IPcDMr5.png) And of course [mom isn't safe from being lewded](http://i.imgur.com/YnTy3Ry.png) Why do you have to go so early, I would've loved to see more of her T_T [Masamune's dad looked pretty cool too.](http://i.imgur.com/Evb4dhg.png) He reminds me of a lot more mellowed out Kiritsugu. Now excuse me while I scour pixiv for art with these two parents being lovey-dovey together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso holy shit. I just realized that Sagiri's biological father is still alive since her mom and dad just divorced. I wonder if the LNs have touched that subject."

Though back then her art style was completely different to her current style as Eromanga-sensei, which she learned from her mom, who also happens to enjoy drawing lewd drawings. I can see where the resemblance comes from, and I'm not talking about their looks. lol\n\nWhile Sagiri influenced Masamune to go pro, he too influenced her to come out of her shut-in lifestyle for the first time (before her mom's death reversed all that) and had her studying drawing from her mom in a bid to also go pro."

Which is confusing for the audience because if we're reading subtitles for a show like this, we probably know enough about Japan to be aware of the Yanki subculture, but don't know enough Japanese to pick up on what word they translated as yankee without help from someone who does speak Japanese. I know I don't.\n\nIt's also apparently an outdated usage. I looked into it last week and apparently it goes back to either shortly after Commodore Perry forced them to let Americans in to trade, or to the post-WWII reconstruction period. I can't remember which and the last time I went to double check I couldn't find the reference. Either way, it's not common now."
