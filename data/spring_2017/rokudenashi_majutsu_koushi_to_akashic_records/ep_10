Glenn doesn't strike me as someone who would be so entirely selfless. \n\nIf Kiritsugu was put in the dilemma from this episode (letting the blow up the tower and letting the hostage be taken, versus using up his remaining magic in an attempt to free the hostage, thus risking his life), **he would have killed the hostage**. Realizing that there must be a grand motive to taking the risk of attacking a well-protected school, he would have denied the group of evildoers their prize, and gone after the group later. He would take the assured path, instead of gambling on his own strenght. \n"

It makes Glen's baited magic usage feel much less awesome than it actually was.\n\nBasically, every magician is subjected to the law of mana biorhythm, no matter how strong they are. [mana biorhythm details](/s \"There are 3 states of mana: neutral (normal), law (the excited state while casting magic), and chaos (where magic cannot be controlled). When the magician casts magic, the mana state will raise from 'normal' to 'law', and then fall down to 'chaos' no matter what, making them unable to control magic\").\n\n[The details of Glen's trap](/s \"Glen used magic first to demonstrate the deactivation of 'The Fool's world', baiting the opponent to use a spell. After that, he aimed at the point where the enemy's mana biorhythm reaches the 'law' state right before the spell release to seal it with 'The Fool's world'. The enemy's mana state would then reach the 'chaos' state, making him lose controls of all magic swords. With superior close combat capabilities, Glen would be able to win easily. On the other hand, if the enemy used the sword instead of magic to attack Glen, Glen's lightning pierce would hit the enemy before the sword could reach him, which would mean Glen's victory. The opponent was very good that he recognized the trap and deactivated his spell before his mana reaches the law state, then decided to use the swords to defend himself instead of attacking. Nonetheless, it demonstrates Glen's capabilities in reading an enemy's mana amplitudes and perfect battle strategy, which could only be done by a very battle-worn magician\").\n\n\n"

Huey is also loved by his students and Sistine lookup to Huey (Mentioned in the Manga) \n\nIt's just that, as a teacher myself as well, we have to follow a certain curriculum. And in a class period, we don't really have enough time to teach every little small thing (I am teaching in a tertiary level btw). \n\nFor example, \n\n1. you learn to cast Shock Bolt using 3 lines\n2. you learn to shorten the cast\n\nThere is not enough time to learn to modify it as there are other topics/spells to cover. (modified spell would be an advance topic for them later on)\n\nI would say Huey would be teaching in what we call a \"textbook example\", while Glenn is more practical based. Textbook example usually try to teach in a easiest form possible to understand but sometime omit certain less use requirements. \n\nAn example would be:\nIn Huey's class, students are likely to learn:\nHow to cast Shock Bolt so that it will success\n(Which will allow them pass their exam)\n\nWhile in Glenn's class, students learn to:\nHow to cast Shock Bolt so that it failed the way you wanted.\n(Umm....This is not going to be in the exam and why would you want to fail in the first place? you can also create a modified Shock Bolt spell that curve right, why do you need to rely on a failed cast? <-- of course in this fantasy case, it might benefit student who cannot cast modified spell.)\n\nGlen is definitely knowledgeable about magic but his not familiar with textbook examples. That's why when Lynn ask him questions, he have to look it up on the textbook, can't find the answer and tell her to look it up herself (LOL).  <--- I agree with Glen on this thought, student should learn to look it up yourself so that we teacher can focus on problems not widely available online.\n\nThought, this actually do happen as I had instance where student ask me the correct terminology for that specific problem and I have to look it up because I usually call it differently (Which is not what I meant to teach as I am required to teach the correct term). \n\nTo be honest, the only reason that Glenn can teach this way is because he gets the special treatment, any other teacher will probably get fired by the education board. I mean, his teaching completely outside the scope and his teaching his student how to fail! (Though I also uses this method, purposely create a fail scenario so students can understand the reason and solution to the problem.)\n\nThe way I see it is that at the end of a semester Huey's student would be able to cast mid level spells and/or quick cast.\n\nWhile Glenn's students can only cast full version low level spells but can control more efficiently. \n\nWhich is better? you decide. But my guess is that students would want to learn the cool stuff faster like meteor showers rather than Shock Bolt for whole semester.\n\nBut, ultimately, I think both Glen and Huey is great teachers.=D\n\nP.S. If there is magic class in real-life I want to teach this too. XD"

He asks them \"hey, what happens if you change the spell like this?\" and they say it'll fail, so he uses that terminology for the rest of his example, asking them \"but how will it fail?\" to which they say that there's no way to tell. \n\nThen Glenn does a breakdown, showing that it is in fact possible to predict the ways in which it would \"fail,\" making it essentially a slightly different spell rather than a failure of the first spell (unless, of course, you meant to cast the first spell - getting a different spell does count as a failure then). The only reason the students thought those results were failures in the past was because they didn't understand the magic fully enough to realize that the results of different changes were predictable. \n\nSo I would say in fact just the opposite. Huey is teaching the practical \"do this and get this result\" method without giving any understanding as to why it works while Glenn is teaching the \"this is how and why magic works.\" In the short term, Glenn's students will know fewer spells, but in the long term, their understanding of magic will make them far more capable of using spells and creating their own (even if Glenn says original magic is a waste of time). \n\nThat's why he's able to ask Sistine to modify her wind spell to achieve the effect he wanted. She was able to take the lessons that Glenn had taught them about shock bolt and apply them to her wind spell.\n\nAs for whether it's special treatment... there definitely was ~~some~~ a lot at the start, but after he starts actually teaching the headmaster's clearly pleased and students from other classes are attending Glenn's classes instead. I think it would be weird for those two things to happen if his methods would result in students failing, so there might not be any kind of standardized test at that school.\n\n> It's just that, as a teacher myself as well, we have to follow a certain curriculum.\n\nBoth my parents are teachers - my mom's an English teacher and my dad's a band director. So like you might expect, my mom has to spend all her time following the curriculum like you said, while my dad doesn't have anything he's particularly expected to do beyond \"do well at competitions in order to get more funding.\" So I totally understand what you're getting at. I just think that this school is perhaps closer to band directing than English. "

   "text": "Agree.\n\nWhat I mean by teaching to fail is that his teaching a different perspective to the problem. Like I mentioned, I personally like this technique as well.\n\nFor example in programming, Huey are likely to teach his student not to create an infinite loop. As that will cause your program to crash (or your spell to explode and it's dangerous).\n\nI personally will tell my student to try it anyway (crash the program) so that they know what will happen and can understand why you should not do it. (in fantasy case, create a mini spell that you cant control)\n\nGlenn will probably take it one step further and question, what if you create an infinite loop but separate the activation process (across different frames/time) so that it will run continue to run. (which is what game engine does with it's infinite update loop).\n\nNow you can take this one step further, and question what if u add in a condition and a break point so that it will burst/stop only after the condition is met? (Which could ultimately lead to the creation of trap spells. =D )\n\nHowever, as I mentioned to teach all this, it will probably take more than 1 lesson just on loops. While some student would enjoy this new perspective, I expect there will be other students that will complaint with something like, \"OMG we are half way through the semester and all we learnt is Shock Bolt!!\" \n\nAlso, if the two class competes, I am suspecting that Glenn's student's Modified Shock Bolt gonna get KO by an instant 1 line dispel force."

And presumably, after learning his whole magical theory with shock bolt as the example, they could do what he did and make an entirely different but shorter chant to achieve the same effect (remember he said just one word and it was shock bolt even though he's not capable of shortening chants). And they'll be able to apply what they're learning here to every other spell they ever learn.\n\nThough I agree that if the book doesn't give them all the chants they're supposed to learn, Glenn'll probably have to make a pamphlet or something. What would be more ideal is if Glenn was teaching the first year class, and then they spent the second and whatever other years learning spells."

If you understand the fundamental, you can probably apply that on different aspects and create new solutions (I am looking at you -> \"original magic\"). That's how scientists and inventors create new inventions, by looking at the fundamentals in a different perspectives. \n\nBut then again, not all scientists and new inventions are recognized, so you would better of learning stuff that everyone needs. (Job requirements etc) Hence, original magic is probably a waste of time... well depend on how you look at it. \n\nPretty cool how you can link to real world scenario right? =P\n"

Blonde lady (I really need to learn her name) said that just altering the teleportation seal would take at least half a day, and Glenn said it's been about that long (though I agree that their lighting makes it seem much more like 3/4 of a day). Still, blonde lady is definitely a very powerful mage, and if she thinks it would take half a day, it's probably safe to assume that less-strong people would take longer. He can't have started working on it until at least after the rest of the teachers left, since they had to use the seal to go to wherever they went and definitely would have noticed if they'd ended up somewhere else, and possibly couldn't start until he had Rumia sitting there in it (depending on how that sort of thing works). And he additionally did what is probably another complicated seal on top of that one. I admit, I'm making an assumption on the complexity of conditional human bomb seals, but even ignoring that it's decently impressive. \n\n...

   "text": "This show steps its foot into a plethora of cliches, but it also does them all in ways that are entertaining and engaging to watch. Rokudenashi isn't best-anime-of-all-time material, but for the usually shitty, boring setting and scenario it's taking on, it's doing extraordinarily well so far.  It's not doing anything original per say, but it's definitely above-average for these specific types of shows - and steps above the slim-pickings this season.\n\nI really like Glenn's type of character. OP, underestimated, snarky, jerk-with-a-heart-of-gold main characters are my weakness, doubly so if they're trying to redeem themselves/run away from something in the past. It's a surprisingly common archetype, and one I adore in every form, even in series that aren't particularly outstanding. Ikta from Aldermain, Ed from FMA/FMAB, Onizuka from GTO, characters like them. I'm super biased to said shows, and Rokudenashi is no exception. I'm expecting to be invested and have a lot of fun with this show all the way to the end. So far, it's conjuring up memories of GTO despite their large differences, and that's definitely a good sign for me. \n\nRokudenashi is the kind of fun, feel-good anime everyone needs in their life sometimes. It's like the Wendy's of fast-food joints. Not some high end shit, but goddamn, Wendy's is delicious and I know it's much better than the other stuff I could be eating. 10/10, combo one is the best, I would eat there again, hell yeah. Point is - I'm really enjoying this show so far. "

You said it makes sense that maybe she wouldn't think or talk about it immediately, especially since they had a lot of other pressing issues at hand, but I guarantee it'll never come up again.\n\nIn which case, what was the point of the scene in the first place? Why put her through something so brutal if it's just going to be a joke and she's never going to think or talk about it again?\n\nIn this case, it's so she can feel indebted to Glenn I guess, but they could have made that happen in a million other ways.\n\nI also completely disagree that she had already fallen for him. Yes, she is a modern tsundere (with very little tsun), but up until this episode she'd mostly still been pissed at him constantly, with a few moments of surprise when he stopped acting like a little shit for 2 seconds. As someone who understands the genre, yes, you can assume that this is a straightforward show and she's clearly going to eventually fall for him, but the attempted rape was used as a tool to advance that progression, which is just shitty."

The montage was the cut stuff.\n\nThe part after Glenn beat the Sword Guy, Glenn collapsed and Sistina took him to a room to heal him.\n\nAfter healing him, they showed Glenn heading to the place where Huey was and had to fight through tons of stone golems.\n\nThey changed things around, but the important stuff was there. Sistina didn't have to move Glenn, they still told why he hated magic (and abreviated version), and the whole point with the Golem battle was to show that The Fool doesn't work on magic thats already been casted and Glenn's weak against opponents he can't just beat with his The Fool + martial arts, which was already shown when he fought the Sword Guy.\n\nThey did cut out an important part near the end, but they'll likely just show it later on, likely near the conclusion of the season.\n\nThe theme of the series is Idealism VS Cynicism"

Glenn isn't as OP as I thought he would be, but still strong enough to justice punch everyone in the face. I kind of wanted them to reveal to Rumia that he was the guy who saved her 3(?) years ago, but maybe next arc. I hope Rumia gets some more focus next arc after it was revealed that she is/was a princess and she seems to be pretty important.\n\nI'm pretty excited for the next arc and it's certainly one of the better magic high school anime I've watched.

Why not choose a 3rd option? defect from the organization and lay low, change your identity and travel to another country. It's not like he didn't have time to think about it. He stated he was a 10 year ticking time bomb.\n\nOr if he's already so sure the organization plans will fail, why not help Glenn dispel the barrier?

Still having just a little bit of trouble understanding the magic system in general. \n\nEdit: Going back to episode 2, the whole autosuggestion thing is still murky. Glenn says that making shock bolt four lines will cause it to curve right, but isn't that curve due to the fact he has associated a right curve with four lines? So technically the four line shock bolt can be any variation via autosuggestion, but the writing makes it sound like it's an absolute. \n\nRegardless, Glenn may be a strongest weakest protagonist, but enough about this show is different from the genre to make it enjoyable to watch.

   "text": "I legitimately don't count Sequel seasons :3 They rely too much on the previous season to build upon, so I count the start date as to what \"year\" it's attributed to. So from that list (and off the top of my head), competitors are.... Iuyashiki, MaidDragon, Akashic Records, and kinda Fate/, but those are wildly variable. \n\nHowever, this is mostly due to how I view sequel seasons. If we were to expand, goddamn do we have a good 9 months ahead of us. Not best of the last 17 years good, but up there for sure. But let's take AoT s2 or MHA s2 as an example as to why I don't count sequels. If I were just looking to start out a series, and was told that these came out this year, then I went to binge S2 alone. Why would I care about anyone or anything that happens?\n\n>Who the hell is this Deku kid, and why does he have such an OP power, yet hardly goddamn uses it? Is it to make a point? The skinny/buff guy seems to like him a lot. Another hero I guess. Now onto this thing... \"Shingooki know kojeen\" huh. Let's give it a g- What the actual fuck. \n\nPoint is they need that S1 (in 90% of cases) to make sense and reel in a viewer. Thus, to be considered \"good\" you have either required reading or previous knowledge. "

I asked why Huey didn't attack Glenn while he was watching his very own magic circle get dismantled before his eyes. Based on the information in the anime, there's nothing stopping him from attacking Glenn. Fool's World was off, Glenn is pretty helpless dismantling the circle, Huey could literally blast any spell at Glenn. Like, ANY SPELL. But no, he just sits there and watches Glenn dismantle his plan to pieces, and is totally okay with it. That, by the way, is not a good villain. There is no explanation why he acted so drastically. His actions need to be built off his characterization, but the thing is, there is nothing to be built off of since he was introduced in the latter half of the episode, and therefore didn't have the time to have a complex development. He portrays himself as a self-composed, calm man, and...that's it. None of the information given to us about Huey tells us he's a character who will set aside his plan just because Glenn is determined to save his student.\n\n"

Granted it is clearly influenced by other works of fantasy which isn't a bad thing mind you but it does draw comparisons to over shows unfortunately because of it. \n\nBut the magic system is so far the stand out. Changing how spells work based on how they are spoken is an interesting aspect. Other works have explored this aspect a little but this is the first time in anime I can remember someone breaking down how changing various aspects of how the chant is spoken effects the spells in various ways.\n\nI am hoping they continue to emphasize this at times rather than just mentioning it and never addressing it again. \n\nLOL can confirm a mage that specializes in silence and counter magic while being a melee powerhouse is indeed a great mage assassin.\n\nSo far this show is kinda standard fantasy anime with all the leads being various tropes but written well enough to be serviceable. They are not cringe inducing but so far are not exceptionally either. I'll continue to watch and see where the series goes but its off to a fair start. "
