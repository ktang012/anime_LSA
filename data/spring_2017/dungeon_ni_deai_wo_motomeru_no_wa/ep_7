The pacing is pretty decent now, but again, I really wish that had adapted more of Ais's inner thoughts that give her more personality. [Take a look at these](http://imgur.com/a/lTVE7); they are some of Ais's monologue that happened before the end of this episode. It really sets the tone in Ais's character - her desperation for power. The current Ais we see is pretty... bland (maybe?) for the moment. Hopefully her scenes during the training with Bell in later episodes aren't like that.\n\nMore cut off scenes:\n\n* [More of Finn's badass moment](http://i.imgur.com/4gKUIJ0.png)\n\n* [Original scene where Ais got rekt by Redhair-chan](http://imgur.com/a/frRUO)\n\n* [Riveria actually did a follow up attack on monster, not just decoy](http://imgur.com/a/N5ZYB)\n\nAll in all, I'm pretty satisfied with this episode despite the cuts.

That's not how it's supposed to be. Ais is not good at expressing her thoughts in words, but she is constantly thinking about things revolving around her. Her quest for more power, the reason behind it, her thoughts on Bell, her strategies during battle, etc. This spin off is supposed to put things in Ais's perspective, versus from Bell's perspective in the main series. Unfortunately, the adaptation removed all of these from her and makes her character very one dimensional thus far.\n\nedit: wow cmon redditors don't downvote because you disagree."

I really think Sword Oratoria (the manga, at least) stands head and shoulders above its parent story. Maybe the studio is uncomfortable with the dynamic that Ais' development brings to table? Maybe they think the way it was done in the manga wouldn't translate well to anime? \n\nI don't know. As of now, Sword Oratoria is 'meh' whereas I expected it to be somewhere from 'okay' to 'good'.

Being lvl 3 should mean you're already have experience of fighting monsters. Also becoming level 3 in Danmachi is no joke. It take a year or 2 for someone to reach level 2. Leveling up to level 3 probably takes longer than that and takes alot of work. And the only way you can level up in the series is by gaining EXPERIENCE, which is a common thing in every RPG and MMO game. So if it took like 3 years for Lefiya to level up to LVL 3, she should already have experience and some tough skin against monsters. This is why she should not be a underdog when she already or suppose to have experiences already when she lvl 3. It makes zero sense for her to be one. And guess what, I heard in the manga version, she was not like that at all. She actually fought monsters pretty well in the beginning.  \n\nThe fact that the anime made her a underdog without atleast notching her level down a notch is just stupid. Bell is already a better fighter than her when he face off against the Minotaur and he was level 2 at that time. This is why people complained about Lefiya's character and this anime.  \n"

   "text": "An introductory arc is not the problem. The real problem is that the anime did not focus on Ais or her POV in the beginning like the manga and light novel did. When I read the manga, it cut to the chase and showed Ais saving Bell from the Minotaur. The manga showed her reaction and inner thoughts in the panels so the readers can know her POV on the situation. This set up the entire spin-off that the story will be centered around Ais like it should. Ais is the main selling point of this spin-off. The fact that the anime didn't do this makes me scratch my head and makes me think whoever directed this is out of touch or had not watch the original series.  \n\n\nAnd even if you were right, 3 episodes does not excuse how poor of a choice to have Leafiy as a main focus and as the lead-in to Ais.  They have chose someone like Riveria or Finn since they would be more interesting POV. Leafiy is a weak and unrelatable character. The fact that they try to protray her as a underdog was a bad idea because they make it seem like she a female version of Bell but with a \" please notice me, senpai\" obsessive issue.\n\nBut the biggest problem with Leafiy is this: Having her being the main focus in the first 3 episodes was *highly unnecessary*. It did not need to happen.\n\nThe manga did well when it just introduced Ais first and showed her saving Bell. It also had the first chapter focus on her and her reason for fighting so hard. The anime had not did that. Instead it focus on Leafiy and her problems which does not nothing for the spin-off except that takes away most of the important monologues and focus from Ais.  If this spin-off was suppose to be about Ais's jounery or what she was doing while Bell was saving the day or whatever, then they should not have a minor character be the main focus of the first 3 episodes. And the fact that it lasted over 3 episodes is horrible. I saw people, who are not danmachi fans by any means, dropped the anime because of the focus on Leafiy. If you trying to get people to watch this anime, you pull people in with a strong character, character that has a interesting  \ntrait, or a interesting goal. Leafiy has none of that and that what is hurting her and this anime. She is not relatable. She is not interesting. She feels like a female version of Bell which makes her less unique and different.\n\nAnd if you compare her to Ais, she looks even more of a horrible character because Ais beats her in all of the catagory I mentioned above. Ais has a interesting goal, she has a interesting trait, and she a strong character. Also she has a interesting background which makes her character more in-depth. Leafiy is like a plain cardboard. There is no depth in her. \n\nBottomline is: Leafiy a bad choice of a character to have a spotlight on. \n\nIt should have been Ais with the spotlight in the first 3 episodes because 1) this is what the spin-off is all about or what it should be about. 2) She the major selling point. 3) She has a strong character, a interesting backstory, an interesting goal, and a better personality. 4) People want to know her POV on Bell and on the things that happened around them. The anime never did any of that and this is why people are complaining about it.\n\n\n"

She's probably done better in the source but she's been nothing special so far. \n\n> Bottomline is: Leafiy a bad choice of a character to have a spotlight on.\n\nShe hasn't been in the spotlight for the past two episodes. I highly doubt she will be in the next one either so that's already half the show. So please stop saying this entire show has the spotlight on her. It was one arc, get over it.\n\n> The anime never did any of that and this is why people are complaining about it.\n\nThe anime didn't adapt a lot of things right but that's in no way on Lefiya.

It's actually nice to enjoy a show.\"\n\nActually, I watch the anime before I read the manga. And I was actually enjoying a little of it too until I saw how people were complaining about it and I went to find out why. When I did find out, I realized that the anime had botched things up and it should have been better than what is being given to me. Then I read the manga and I realized why people are complaining. And they have a vaild point to complain because they spent money and time being invested into the series. If I was reading the manga before the anime adaption came out, I be pissed too because this series happens to be one of my favorite series ever and this is the only series where I will buy a LN just to read more of the story. \n\nYou obviously may not like that people are complaining about this, but those people have a right to complain. They spent money on this series and invested their time in it. They wanted a good adaption so the anime only watchers will know how good the series is, but now they can't feel that well because the anime is doing a awful job. You may not see it that way because you may have a medicare taste in anime or you just one of those people that settle for medicare animes.  \n\n\nI know it isn't about Lefiya. I am just stating why Lefiya is hated. My real hate goes to the people that thought having a minor character to be the main focus was a good idea and to not show Aiz's monologues. \n\nAnd to reply to that bottom of yours. Yes, she was the main character in those 3 episodes. Just because they are not fading away from her does not mean she wasn't main focus in those episodes. \n\nAnd also, how can you say that we already know alot about Loki Familia when the anime in the first season never told much about them except that they are the strongest familia in the city. Plus, the spin-off  keeps leaving out important moments and details of the group. We still do not know about them. We don't know much about Finn, Riveria, Welf, the twins, or even Ais yet. Also, why do we need to know anything about Lefiya when nobody even asked to know about her? If the anime wanted us to know more about Lefiya, they should do it in one episode and not in THREES. \n\nAnd the reason why the familia is so OP and Samey is because what I said above. We do not know anything much about each familia member. The anime never did any backstories or arcs for the members except for Lefiya and Ais. If the anime were to tell or show backstories of each member, they probably wouldn't feel samey."

The case of the strongest Lv1 (barring outliers like Bell) fighting against the weakest Lv2 also counts; for example, if you're Lv2 but you have basically nothing in the way of combat skills and specialise in crafting, a Lv1 who's particularly good at combat and has very high stats can probably best you. In this universe, your stats appear to reset when you level, but the stats you gained previously are carried over as a hidden value and receive an undisclosed multiplier. That's why Bell, for example, suddenly became significantly faster after levelling up; his already ridiculous stats were amplified in the process."
