   "text": "Another really good episode that has a lot of things that I appreciate.\n\nI like how the main character doesn't react hard to anything. Upon hearing about the girls as weapons, he doesn't suddenly break down mentally or even really change his attitude towards them; he feels some sort of negativity about it but also seems to have an understanding of it. When Ithea tries teasing or provoking him, he doesn't immediately go \"EHHHHHHHH?!\" and try stammering around it, he just kinda goes with it. The fanservice is there, but it's tasteful--maybe the massage was provoking with the voice acting, but at least it has a justification that was honestly both hilarious and clever to me. And I'm quickly getting on board with a romance between Chthulu-chan and Willem; it seems only impulsive since Chtholly believes she will die (uh.... yeah, can we not?), but the two have great chemistry together so I can easily believe it.\n\nIt's all good, I'm still really loving it."

And guys always sound like they're in pain either way. \n\n.... ... ...\n\n-revelation- \n\nI just realized/remembered. I originally, back a decade ago, thought that girls in hentai always sounded like they were in pain. Over time I've adjusted to assuming that sound was pleasure. Guys though, being not so prevalent in the kinds of hentai/ecchi I watch, continue to sound like they're in pain to me. I always worry that I'm hurting them, and then they're annoyed because they're like \"don't fucking stop *now*.\" \n\nHoly crap. By myself I'm structured to assume all sounds are pain and with hentai/ecchi conditioning I'm structured to assume all sounds are the opposite. There's something really wrong with me either way. Dear god. I mean, I knew I was messed up, but I didn't realize it was to this extent.\n\nCan I go back to not knowing this?"

   "text": "The term \u201cemnetwiht\u201d actually derives from Old English, and etymologically is related to the term \u201cbarrowwiht\u201d or \u201cbarrow wight\u201d. \u201cBarrow\u201d and \u201cEmnet\u201d are actually opposites, meaning mound and a level plain, respectively. This is interesting since the official page lists both emnetwiht **and** barrowwiht as [races](http://sukasuka-anime.com/chara/souwong.html).\n\nBoth terms were used by [Tolkien](http://oldewyrd.blogspot.com/):\n\n>And in the first book of The Lord of the Rings, the hobbits encounter a barrow-wight, a supernatural being that guards the treasure in a barrow or grave. The term was actually coined in the 19th century by Andrew Lang, a writer about myths and legends. It is a compounding of barrow and wight, an Old English term for a living creature, especially a human. This sense long ago fell out of use. Wight also has had a sense of a supernatural being since c. 950. This second sense also fell out of general use, although writers, like Lang and Tolkien, have made occasional use of it over the centuries to evoke an archaic atmosphere.\n\n>A barrow is a mound of earth and stones erected over a grave. Originally from an Old English word for mountain, that sense has long passed out of the language, except in the names of particular hills. The term survived as a local term for a grave mound in the Southwest of England. It since has enjoyed a revival as an archeological term. Tolkien uses it the sense of a grave mound, especially those found just outside the borders of the Shire.\n\nFurther:\n\n>Place names in Rohan are also from Old English. The capital is Edoras, or the courts, and the king\u2019s hall is Meduseld, or mead-hall. Districts in Rohan are Eastemnet and Westemnet, from the Old English emnet meaning plain or level ground.\n\n    Interesting\u2026"

   "text": "citing Essay-kun known as **Mitrospeed** (u/Mitrospeed ?)\n\nAh I loved pretty much everything about this episode.\n\nThis here establishes some of the series's **strongest points**, the melancholic atmosphere and sadness slowly creeping up as you're faced with an impending doom. We were shown the bright side of the facility, the energy of children in their most innocent and careless time within their lives, well maybe a little bit too careless as we learn eventually.\n\nThe sole existence of these kids is to be soldiers and eventually sacrificial pawns when the enemy is too overbearing to handle with regular measures. They seem to be aware of this fact but it also seems that the lack of a parental figure who can teach them the importance of life and your own self being left a tremendous hole in their sense of self preservation. The way they brought this across differs a little from the novels as Almita had her arm pierced by a twig while here she fell head on from a cliff. I guess **having your head hurt which is a vital body part** brings the message across in a more clear way.\n\nAnyways, this and many other things serve as means to bring across this feeling of sadness behind this so happy facade that is children just enjoying themselves and it seems Willem is all to aware of that too.\n\nCan we talk about Willem for a moment cause oh boy, it's like a breath of fresh air for me. He's *not embarrassed* every minute or so because he is surrounded by multiple girls, he brushes of the suggestive advances of Naigrat ( yes I'll call her that now :P ), he **stays collected** and professional but can also be shaken by stuff he didn't expect yet he does not weigh on it for too long so it would become exaggerated. To me he feels like a **father figure** to most of the girls, someone who has seen a lot in his life and can't be swayed easily but has moment of familiarity and eases up when he is reminded of his family.\n\nThe ending dialogue between Willem and Kutori ( which is supported by a humming version of Always in my heart...soooo goood ) drops a bomb on us as we realize that the older those girls get the more aware they become of the importance of their own life. They eventually **don't want to die in some sort of last resort**, heck they *don't want to die **at all** but they can't help it. Kutori knows that and instead focuses on making as many experiences as she can get which comes right back to what she said in episode 1. She was satisfied with the experiences she had in the city and could move on now but she still has things she wishes to do before she has to end her own life.\n\nWell and about that ending scene. It was some sort of acupuncture treatment cause Kutori accumulated too much Venom in her muscles which leads to a feverish state and muscles cramps. Willem who seems to have used these weapons and venom before knows how to treat this and he went right at it while staying professional. He didn't throw a fit because he's touching a girl, he didn't make the scene suggestive, he maintained the state of the weaponry, as harsh as that sounds :P "

Hopefull ythey touch on that soon.  \n\nI liked MC-kuns reaction to seeing the weapons, but i feel like him knowing all thier names should be a big red flag for everyone.  arnt those military secret weapons that no one should know about?  In the ending flashback we see him with 2 girls using the 2 faries swords and he also has 2 of the swords on his back, that didnt seem to be in the armory... so where is his swords then...  I like this setup though and look foward to where it goes.  \n\nEveryone has been saying how this is a lot like Black Bullet (which i agree, but it isnt a bad thing).  I like how the situation is similiar too.  MC-kun is a lot like those girls, a holy sword user, so im guessing hes going to choose to fight with them in 5 days and try to change fate.  Rentaro in Black Bullet was the same, he was also a tool to fight the monsters and fought with the girls to try to change thier fate.  Its a nice parallel.  \n\nWe shall see where it goes from here!  \n\n[](#meguminthumbsup)"

[LN spoilers](/s \"He comes from a (relatively) normal human background, despite the requirement to use the holy swords being that destiny literally hates you (Chtholly's sword in particular; it's the strongest) and can't really fight due to the aftereffects of a curse that left him petrified for 500 years. A little bit of training with Chtholly (will probably happen next ep) nearly kills him. Furthermore, the purpose of the Holy Swords wasn't to kill Beasts, it was to kill what are essentially the Gods, as they regard humans as a mistake and tried to wipe them out on multiple occasions.\")\n\nThere are absolutely key differences between SukaSuka and Black Bullet, but most of them delve into spoiler territory (I've tagged basically everything that hasn't been mentioned in the anime yet but there are fundamental differences between them)."

While it was a relief to see them returning safely, Willem is obviously not going to get his hopes up as he knows that the next time they return, it may well be in a casket. Being the welcoming party for someone who may or may not be returning home alive is not a pleasant job.\n\nThe little heart-to-heart between him and Ithea on the way back was also pretty nice. Simple and to the point with neither of them really hiding anything about what they are or what they know.

She just reads a ton of trashy romance novels, which is why she seems to communicate almost entirely in shitty romance cliches. It's explained in the LN that they don't really get to leave the island at all outside of military business, so most of their knowledge of the outside world comes from just books and stuff from the mansion.\n\nA lot of exposition was cut form the anime, which in most cases isn't really necessary at all but in this case I think it can definitely make a lot of people view her a lot less charitably lol (and even ignoring that I can see why her dialogue would still still come off as pretty grating). But even if the execution doesn't work it's not really that odd for a teenager, there are plenty of teenage girls who can't help but constantly compare their lives to twilight or w/e."
