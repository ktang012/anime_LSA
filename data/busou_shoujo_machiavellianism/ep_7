They have massive egos, and they attack (with real swords) on defenseless male students and torture people as a type of correction, not to mention their super aggressive, clingy and jealous. No way would I ever fall in love with any one of these girls. \n\nIf I were Nomura I would just fight these girls, collect all the stamps, leave and never return. I wouldn't care if any of these girls have feelings for me. Considering the beatings, the fights, and the physical abuse these girls gave me, it will be worth it leaving this school and never coming back (But I would miss Kyo-bo). Trust me if I never see those girls again, it'll be too soon.\n\nNomura shouldn't waste his time with these girls (Romantically) they're not worth it."

At this rate anything that resembles being female fall under his charm. Lets hope the boys with make up don't follow this up\n\nAh the good ol' [censoring lights](http://imgur.com/kEMqUak.jpg), I see they are following the Gabriel Dropout explanation for those annoying light bars.\n\nSo, Nomura's best defense is that he did not have a [boner](http://imgur.com/lydYHWN.jpg)? You know, they are girls and they will immediately come out with 2 possible explanations why you did not get a boner.\n\nThis is probably the wierdest [ship](http://imgur.com/DhZj5pp.jpg) I've seen in a while. And I mean Nomura & the bear.\n\nYeah, that's the first place I'd [look for a memory card](http://imgur.com/qfOdAVi.jpg), not a purse or gymbag, or inside pockets, you know.\n\nNomura's quite the ladies man, so fast getting to third base... with a [bear](http://imgur.com/q93hA4w.jpg). And a [loli](http://imgur.com/tYHu8qs.jpg)\n\nBonus: [Satori's stitch](http://imgur.com/Rj2OoOR.jpg) (could have done a better job, but I'm short on time)\n\nThis felt alot like episode 2, a forced raid into the girls dorm. Could have been funnier but it lacked effort, can't put my finger what this episode lacked exactly\n\n[](#biiru)\n\n\n"
