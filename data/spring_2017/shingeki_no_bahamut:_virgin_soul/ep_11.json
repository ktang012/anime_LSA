Sometimes tsukeru is used to say you wear something yourself, other times it means to attach something to something else (or someone).\n\nThis is a quite bad confusing mistranslation, I'm guessing the translators didn't watch season 1? Otherwise it's an honest mistake. Bacchus, the god, did show that he was wearing and therefore capable of wearing the bracelet, so maybe the translator figured only gods could be bounty hunters or something since there are gods everywhere in this show."

Episode 2: epic dragon animagus shows up, is neutral party. Episode 2 still: Azazel tries to convince dragon to join the demon team.\n\nNow, episode 3: motherfucking king already tired of hentai akuma's bullshitting all over his aristocrats decides to play the brutal army card combo genocide to lure him and kill him. STILL IN EPISODE 3:  Kaisar takes matters in his own hands, too, and tries to first make the king not do thing, then to stop Azazel from getting himself obliterated.\n\nIn any normal anime episode 3 would be episode 11.

He basically implies that at the colosseum when he smiles as he observes the deamons killing each other for the enjoyment of humans. \nAlso, be aware that a majority of the power that protected humanity came from the gods. It's where Jeanne got her strength and where they go the power to do all those spells. Their issue was mostly that they decide to leave humanity to their own affairs until they deem necessary, sometimes to a detriment, but they did help out humanity a lot.\n\nAs for the demons. It would be different if Charioce was attacking some of the big leaguers like Belzeebub who would actively mess with humans. Mostly the weak and smaller ones stayed mostly to their realm of Hell. In fact it was actually quite rare to see a demon, which was why Amira showing up and being a demon in the beginning of the first season was surprising to Favaro and why you had to be on your guard when his stone glowed red. In general, the demons mostly kept to themselves. They did nothing close to what Charioce is doing to them. \n\nSo, even if he's trying to come at it from that perspective, he would still be in the wrong. I mean, he's actively pushing for the genocide of two races here, which is never good no matter where he's coming from."

Working together to prevent the world's destruction, the rival deities barely managed to seal Bahamut, agreeing to split the key between them so that **the dragon** would remain eternally imprisoned.\n>\n>With the world safe from the destruction of Bahamut, it is business as usual for bounty hunters like Favaro Leone.

Like it was fine but there were clearly parts they should've spend less time on certain scenes and more time on others. \n\nNow here? The writers are killing it! Every story beat has been point  and the more impressive thing is they are able to weave previous characters into the narrative without them overshadowing the new ones.  That is not easily accomplished which they should be compended.\n\nLike with the King he is being treated as the ultimate evil with his actions to the demons being most cruel.  But If he is the guy with glasses we see another side to him where he is overlooking a  grave.  In that one scene we get his motivation for fighting and while we don't know the reason why this person died or who it is we get that this death impacted the King so much that he went on a personal crusade to rid the world of demons.  Just superb writing all around.  "

If you want the 2 shorts between seasons we see Favaro leave the city to do some soul searching, and i guess that eventully lead him to dragon village.  Its an interesting development and answers why she acts like him so much.  I just cant wait for him to finally show up because its gonna be epic as hell.  I really hope we get a Kaiser x Favaro tag team aginst the king for old times sake in the end and maybe a Nina x Azazel tag team aginst him too.  \n\nThe next revelation we get is that Rocky, Rita's pet hand, is Kaiser's hand that Favaro cut off at the end of season1 in the final boss fight.  That was really an amazing revelation and **hand**led very well.  So if i am to understand this right... Rita and Kaiser created a new life, Rocky...

It has solidly meet all my expectations and blown them out of the water.  [You nailed it once again MAPPA](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/ac/9f/16/ac9f16b9d1e3bbf71e34b80a5232162f.jpg).

   "text": "> Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul - Episode 3\n\nLike everyone else, I really liked how they \"revealed\" Favaro here. I knew immediately from when she said her teacher told her to find Bacchus and his weird wagon. Rita noting that her teacher sounded untrustworthy sealed the deal. :3\n\nOthers have pointed out that the king's motivation also stands as a small yet very important scene. I.e., his motivation for going after the demons/gods is not because \"I am evil\" but most likely because they wronged him in some way. We'll have to wait and see who he lost (lost lover/brother/mother?), but, for now, we have extra characterization for him that adds an interesting dimension to his character.\n\nNina's near libido-driven freak-outs were hilarious again, Bacchus's backstory/conversation gets brought up and foreshadows potential future events with him involved, and seeing (almost) everyone together was, indeed, awesome. This one is doing quite well from the get-go -- just like its predecessor -- and I can't wait to see where they will go with its remaining *21* episodes. :D"
