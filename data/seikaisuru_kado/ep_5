   "text": "That was a fascinating episode for me, because it kept changing my mind in unexpected ways (how's that for meta-storytelling?). At first, I was annoyed by how much Tsukai the \"expert negotiator\" was acting like a typical anime love interest, and I thought her strong feelings about zaShunina were a little extreme. But as her little tour went on, I started to agree with her--and when she explained why she was doing all this stuff, I couldn't help but change my entire opinion about her. Who among us *wouldn't* have an easier time changing someone's mind if we could take them on a physical and mental journey through our thought processes first? That's a chance that we almost never have, and she used it to its fullest potential. That's some seriously impressive rhetoric. \n\nAnd I was also vehemently against the idea of broadcasting the Sansa to the entire world at large with very little warning like this; I agreed with Tsukai that it was horribly invasive and a breach of not only privacy but human dignity. And yet, in just a few lines, Ward had me questioning that idea too. Assuming what we know about it is true and complete, giving people the Sansa doesn't negate whatever feats they accomplish because of it. It's still just human will at work; we don't have a problem with people using all kinds of artificially created substances, especially ones that give us more energy (coffee, for instance). Using something unnatural to do what is difficult or impossible naturally is the essence of technology, is it not? No one *has* to use the Sansa; it's just another tool in humanity's arsenal. I still don't think it should have been shared so easily, but my position isn't so clear anymore. I love how much this show makes me think."

Using the Sansa could have completely unknown effects, the average person does not have the information to make an informed decision. \n\nIt is possible (for argument's sake) that the Sansa has a 50% chance of killing the person watching it and the 3 television dudes all managed to just get lucky. If that was true and people knew about this beforehand, you would imagine the viewership rate to be entirely different than with a disclaimer of \"bad shit can happen, yo\" (while the disclaimer also covers this possibility). This is not even taking into account possible long-term effects. Humans also suffer from thinking \"nah that won't be me\" and adverse effects to something like cigarettes have to be made very visual and plain to understand.\n\nAnd even if this information about the Sansa is known well beforehand, it is unreasonable to assume that every person is capable of making this potentially highly complex decision by themselves. The adverse effects can be something which would be extremely hard to explain to the average person, for example. Generally what we have decided as humans is to have regulating bodies which study these substances and then make the decision if they're fit for public consumption or not for us. Imagine a world where every form of medication comes with the disclaimer that this might also do god knows what to your body and since it's you're free to decide whether you take this medicine or not, it's all on you if it goes to shit."

There's a possibility, but seeing his entrance to Earth, i believe he could just destroy everything in a matter of days before even making any contact.

Now.    \n*cuts to another scene*\n\n***\n\n[](#volibearQ)\n\nOkay, I guess I'll have to do it. Hate me for it if you want. Here we go :\n\n> The universe. Where dust gathered and galaxies were born, where stars were born and where Earth was born. On that Earth, tiny lives were born, and they flourished, and were destroyed, and survived, until at last, humanity was born. Humanity created civilization, built cities and developed culture, and we remain alive to this day. All of that happened here in this universe. Not in the anisotropic.\n\nAaaaaaaaand?     \nSo, life went through countless tragedies and hardships, and, through evolution, it was able to survive. And now, today, here we are, sitting here as **one** of the **many** life forms on Earth.    \nNow, what is your point here? What does the place where it happened have to do with anything? Logically speaking, the anisotropic is a higher dimension and the anisotropic universe, by the virtue of existing in a higher dimension, encompasses our three dimensional universe **in it**. To put it simply, we were already a part of the anisotropic from the beginning whether we were previously conscious of it's existence or not. So, saying something like \"All of that happened here and not in the anisotropic\" is... stupid.\n\nBut, it doesn't end there. Here's the next statement :\n\n> It doesn't belong to the anisotropic. This place belongs to us.\n\nOh the height of human arrogance! What do you mean \"belong\"? Who in the universe gave you that right? Since when did this planet, and this universe, became humanity's personal property? What gives you the right to decide where this universe should go? You live on a tiny tiny tiny piece of rock revolving around a cosmic fireball, which is just one of the billions of other stars that make up our galaxy. And then there's billions of those galaxies in the universe. Despite being conscious of that fact, you're still trying to claim ownership over it. Pull your head out of your arse please.\n\n[Note : A much sound statement would be \"We belong here, and not the anisotropic\", rather than \"This place belongs to us.\" The latter statement implies ownership while the former could refer to a human's basic psychological need of a sense of belonging. As we encounter wam and *salsa*, we seem to be changing too rapidly as a species and this creates an illusion that we're losing our designated spot in nature, that we are becoming something that is neither from this world, nor the anisotropic.\n\nIf it was put like that, I would have no qualms with it. And I really think that as a professional negotiator, Tsukai should have chosen her words more carefully (maybe this is a translation error).]\n\n***\n\n* You might argue that Tsukai's point is to let nature take care of things. And that zaShunina, who is an \"outsider\", should just go back and mind his own business.    \nWhat makes you say that he is an \"outsider\"? We already established that this three dimensional universe is a part of the much greater anisotropic universe. So, maybe zaShunina coming here is the \"natural\" course of things.    \n[The word nature here refers to everything in the anisotropic universe and all it's phenomenon. In this perspective, I consider humans as well as beings of the anisotropic and their actions to be a part of nature and not an interference on it.]\n\n\n* Now, you might also say that it is something along the lines of - \"the journey is more important than the end\".    \nWell then, tell me, what (or where) is the end in this case? Where is humanity going? In the first place, how can you be so sure that this is a journey?    \nIf you talk about the essence of that statement, then that could just as well work in favor of this point. You don't know the end goal, so for all you know the anisotropic's \"interference\" with humanity is just another path in that \"journey\", and maybe this path would be more fun to walk than the path without anisotropic's \"interference\" (you can't say it is \"easier\", wam and *salsa* come with just as many problems as they solve).\n\nAnyways, what ticked me off the most was this final statement in the speech :\n\n> I want to protect the dignity of humanity, and of the world.\n\n[](#laughter)\n\nWhat dignity? Of humanity? Well now, isn't the human race sooo worthy of respect. We take such good care of the things around us, we always respect resources and use them responsibly, ensuring that we don't mess things for other species besides us, because we have nothing but love and respect for them, and we are sooo good-natured, civilized, cultured beings that we never fight among ourselves. I mean look at our history, its full of nothing but \"love and peace\".    \nSo. Yeah. How dare you look down upon us, zaShunina!\n\nPoint is, it is foolish to make such an excuse. The \"pride\" of the human race still sounds doable, but, dignity? Oh come on!\n\n***\n\nSo... the rest of the world did the *salsa*, and now a lot of people can just watch cat videos on Setten non-stop. Good business move there Mr.CEO.\n\nThough I am interested in how watching a video of it can still cause the same effect as watching it in person. I thought it would have something to do with being in the vicinity of it *while* watching it that did the trick. Because a video is a 2 dimensional image, and watching *salsa* in person, in all it's 3D glory, should have a different effect. Like your brain is being forced to recognize *salsa* as a higher dimensional object while everything in it's 3D perception is telling it otherwise (which would better explain the nausea afterwards). I guess you can call it something along the lines of an \"optical illusion\", which forces the brain in a state where it can start to comprehend the anisotropic.\n\n***\n\nI am guessing in the next episode, zaShunina is going to take Shindo into the anisotropic world (we saw quite a vivid scenery in the preview and I think there was a scene with a lot of Kado cubes in there). And to do so, he might have to *forcefully* make some changes in Shindo's body, or maybe he has already done all the preliminary preparations for it and he was looking for a suitable time to do it.\n\nMaybe that's what that \"smile\" was for.\n\nI am so glad that the show is still pretty darn interesting.    \nEdit : Fixed some typos."

Just like our universe is contained in the anisotropic universe, so is the sea contained by earth.\n\n The oceans are their own ecossystem, formed by a multitude of different interactions, balanced interactions. When humanity starts fucking up that balance with oil spills or large-scale fishing (similar to zashunina bringing wam and sansa onto earth), you have to wonder if that human interaction with the sea is an artificial one or if it's just a question of waiting for the sea to establish a new balance with humanity, and therefore making it a natural process/interaction.\n\nMy point is, if a new balance can be established in the universe after the introduction of wam and sansa, then that should be taken as the natural course of action and, therefore accepted.\n\nWith that said, and as I write this, I'm still struggling with both opinions and perspectives (Tsukai's and zashunina's).\n\nEdit: just noticed your post is 2 months old.

She is thinking that if there is some \"destiny\" for humanity that involves being as powerful as zaShunina then there seems like little will be precious at some point in the future. If energy and productivity are limitless, humanity effectively earns the collective capacity to grow orders of magnitude more quickly than we have.  As has been argued before, this rapid, superficially stimulated growth comes with some downsides but, to Tsukai's point, it mostly means losing the things that humanity has but zaShunina does not! That is the result of our struggle with limited resources, productivity, etc. If our end game is to become an individuality-lacking, culture-less superintelligence, we might as well cherish our culture and legacy while we have it."

While I have no reason to treat him as a bad guy, I can't say for certain that he's good either, and that second part is probably the viewpoint of most of the people who are wary of zaShunina and what he's brought. Hell, we don't even know zaShunina's true motivations yet. I view him as a being of logic, and with that, I find it hard to believe that he just wants to give these gifts to humanity 'just because'. And then there's the implications of what zaShunina has shown so far. What else does he want to show us, and how would these things change us in the long run? Would conflict arise in response to these changes (with what's already happening irl, i don't doubt it) and how do we deal with it? Tsukai fears of the status quo being broken, and that's something that usually happens, especially in this grand of a scale. \n\nAnd with the way she articulated her viewpoint, I thought it was perfect, especially if you consider who she's talking to. We already know how intelligent Shindo is, and we also know that he's the one who understands zaShunina the most (if at all). Sure, her argument would be weird in the atmosphere of a normal negotiation, but Tsukai probably thinks that with how much Shindo is involved with the anisotropic, of how much his logic aligns with what zaShunina thinks, the only way to appeal to him is to get to the most humane part of his being, something he doesn't share with zaShunina - his emotions. His sympathy. His human sentiments.\n\n\n>Our world - the messy, chaotic civilization that we have built - won't disappear in a fortnight because of zaShunina's intervention.\n\nSure, but what about the night after that?

It's a testament to the quality of the story that it's bringing out so much discussion among the viewers. :)\n\nYou're absolutely right, I have no way of knowing whether zaShunina plans to alter basic human nature or not. Given what he has done _so far_, that doesn't seem to be the case. While there is ample reason to be cautious, it doesn't mean that humanity ought to do something as rash as reject his offers off-hand and send zaShunina back to the anisotropic. The best compromise would be to create a strict quarantine, and allow only experts to interact with zaShunina (y'know, like in Arrival) and decide what should be made public knowledge.\n\nAnd you know what? I think _you_ framed the argument for caution better than Tsukai. When asked _why_ she wants to send zaShunina away, she literally hand-waves something about 'not wanting this universe to be destroyed', how this universe doesn't belong to the anisotropic, and wanting to protect the dignity of life and humanity. What? Since when do humans get to claim this universe? That isn't an appeal to sentiment; (unlike what she did earlier in the day, like showing her father's worksmanship) I'm not sure what it is. A large part about humanity has been about pushing frontiers, adapting to new situations and being endlessly ambitious. Throwing the sudden revelation of the anisotropic away would be throwing that away too. \n\nAs a form of life, nature dictates that we evolve as required. If the discovery of a new environment, the anisotropic, prompts us to evolve beyond our current state, then so be it! It's not some kind of tragedy, especially if it means that in the long run, humanity can not only save itself from the troubles that are plaguing it, but also find out more about its place in the 'universe' - one that includes the one that we currently identify as ours, _and_ the anisotropic.\n\n..I think I'm digressing. Tsukai should've phrased her argument more pointedly rather than being so wishy-washy: 1) Shindo is spending way too much time in contact with the anisotropic and zaShunina and he knows it 2) Shindo doesn't know if zaShunina is actively brainwashing him and everyone else, given his powers, 3) We still don't know what exactly zaShunina wants, since he insists on giving vague answers, 4) zaShunina is bringing about change that could bring tumultuous change to human society and give it power it is not ready for. That's about it. No need to bring in evolution, stars, or boat trips. \n\nEdit: multiple typos, jeez"

Zashunina is also happening to be doing the same by influencing a lesser being of a lesser universe (in a multiverse) in the most \"peaceful\"/efficient session possible. To him, in this \"great\" session: to simply decide what to do is what matters, because both methodology and probability are endless at any given moment. Both the possibility that: 1) Humanity will achieve perpetual energy if and only if Wam was given by Zashunina. Or 2) Mankind eventually discovers perpetual energy on their own through evolutionary struggles of discovery. He then demonstrated to us that with his negotiation skills, that he has chosen, in fact, both because he is already here to show or find the path of least resistance (efficiency) for mankind's leading minds.  \n\nThe art of negotiation, is to attain mutual benefits for all parties; but, the sense of identity or self may become lost in the process of accommodation and assimilation. Some may argue that it is the paradoxical coexistence of different ideals, people, or nations that define humanity. It is because of such conflicts that mankind has rightfully survived and evolved on their own by the rules of the universe they reside in. To be simply given technologies like Wam deprives us of that very opportunity and responsibility to persevere for \"peace.\" \n\nWith the Wam, he has alleviated the conflict of national boundaries, and now he simply is moving on to the next stage of the \"difference\" problem. With Sansa, I think he is now attempting to end the \"difference\" problem within our very own conscience. To him, humanity struggles to make decisions because they are mortal and spend a great portion of their lives sleeping which may seem to him, akin to the state of death. To that end, I believe that Zashunina feels that sleep is one of the biggest hurdle that mankind would have to leap over when alone.\n\nAlready craving for the next episode arrrgg. \n\nI wonder what would happen if Rick Sanchez met Zashunina. \n\n\"Aw shit, Morty, you see now that I can finally get M-*uu*-Y *uor* Szechuan Dis-*uu*-pense-*rr*!! and a-waaaay we go!\"\n\n\"Those two balls sure got a lot of Wam, don't tell me you're gonna wam us into your wams within all the other wams known to existence, fuck you.. bloe me\"      "

On one side you beat the game quicker and save time.

(Humanity doesn't advance naturally and loses the valuable experience they could have gained in the journey to fixing those problems). She's probably worried humanity will get weaker by relying on an outside element to fix their problems and that humanity could fall under complete control of said outside element. We still don't know if the alien has no ulterior motives. It's a gamble either way and both sides have their pros and cons. It's similar to the argument of privacy vs security.

If Tsukai had framed the issue as \"people aren't comfortable with this, it will cause conflict/unease\" I think it would have carried more weight than arguing \"it's wrong because its unnatural.\"  The first argument focuses on the objective results/issues, the second is a much more subjective value judgement.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen it boils down to it, I can't say I outright disagree with anything you said.

   "text": "As far as the Sansa goes, I still really don't feel zaShuina himself is \"forcing\" anything.  Humans *themselves* are the ones capitalizing on the ideas he's shown them.  He's been about as hands off about it as a \"person\" can be.  He just has a very good product.  How humanity deals with the new information is entirely on them (i.e. it's the choice of other *humans* to show the Sansa on TV, the choice of *humans* to use the wam).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nGranted, if he's deliberately hiding some known drawbacks to entrap humanity, I might have other things to say, but at this point in the show, all he's done is introduce people to new ideas.  I don't really see anything particularly \"forceful\" about that.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>I would definitely lose some wonder if that was the case.   I see how far humans have come and am in awe and amazement.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI guess it really comes down to perspective and what groups you identify with.  Do you define yourself by your identity as *homo sapiens* (being born and raised on earth as a human) or by your identity as fellow sentient beings (extraterrestrials + humans together).  While I can understand that some might argue that humans should do things \"for themselves,\" when it comes down to it, that line of reasoning is a bit xenophobic and self-serving.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIn the way we use it today, should \"humanity\" be defined as all things human (exclusively *homo sapiens*) or all things sentient?  The only reason we haven't had to discuss that issue is because other humans are the only sentient creatures we've come in contact with.  Is being native to Earth really that important?  Should we not approach other sentient beings as similar/the same as us, rather than splitting things up as \"us\" vs. \"them?\"  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nLike others have been saying in this thread, what is \"natural\" and \"human\" is a matter of perspective.  We all *exist* in the universe.  The anistropic is just another region of it we haven't come in contact with.  We all have similar origins in that respect.  Why not focus on the commonality there?  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWhen it comes down to it, though I can understand that some people might feel \"cheated,\" I just don't think its necessarily fair to make a sweeping statement that non human progress is not \"true\" progress.  Everyone has a different basis for what they feel is \"right.\"  There's nothing wrong with feeling that appropriating alien tech is undesirable, but I don't think you can necessarily say its universally \"wrong.\"\n"

   "text": "I'm pretty sure his end goal is to just turn humans into beings like himself. \n\nAfter Shindo's mom asked him whether or not the anisotropic being had family, it got me thinking. We've seen no evidence that there is more than one such being. Now he's converting people's brains to better understand the anisotropic and give them an inhuman quality he presumably possesses (no need to sleep). I'm betting he's just \"lonely\", so to reproduce he'll just make humans like himself. That also fits into the argument presented this episode about about our universe being special to use because its \"natural\".\n\nOf course Shindo's philosophy of mutual understanding which we've heard repeated from the start is probably the real theme of the show. So I expected the end result will be humanity and the anisotropic being meet halfway, both influencing the other until they're similar beings but neither is left unchanged. Something which is implied by the anisotropic being's gradual adoption of human behavior patterns, such as smiling (whether or not he's very good at it right now)."
