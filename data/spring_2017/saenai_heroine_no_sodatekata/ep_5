There are whole volumes dedicated to Megumin and Darkness where he considers them as actual partners and nearly goes through with it. In fact if he wasnt such a bastard he'd had done it with Darkness; either way, there's a clear long-term development for his feelings towards Megumin through the volumes(while Darkness remains as more of a sexual interest), where he and megumin get older and start talking to each other in different manners, up to a point where they both confess their love to eachother and put that on hold due to Megumin's feelings towards other events.  \nSo Eris is more like a really good friend and deity to be worshipped, while Megumin is a real love interest for Kazuma. When he speaks to Eris/Chris, he is comfortable, jokes and is in general just fine with her - while with Megumin he is constantly questioning her own reasons and if she is actually messing with him or if she genuinely likes him. Now that I'm writing it, it is damn complicated to explain it because the author does such a good job of making the development natural; no romance is so simple, and their romance is definitely something that grew overtime and on the background, not something that was shoehorned for the sake of it. It's quite impressive, really. Even with the spoilers I gave to you, I recommend picking up the LNs - they are damn good and IMO one of the best stories I've read in a while.\")"

It's that Tomoya didn't correct Yoshihiko about calling Katou his real wife, but corrected him that that wasn't the cause of their fight. Although if Tomoya keeps this on for far too long she'll soon become his ex-wife instead.\n\nAnyway I just don't understand how Tomoya let his fight with Katou drag on for two months now. Seriously, he has all  the time in the world to apologize face-to-face now that their first project is done, like what the fuck has he been doing? He hasn't even started planning for the new project until later on this episode! \n\n[](#haruhiisnotamused)\n\nAlso we finally see one of Tomoya's flaws in handling his circle, he's too lenient. I'm not saying he should be a slave driver but he needs to learn the difference between business and friends. If he keeps on acting like this with Eriri I doubt this second game will go anywhere.\n\nInteresting that the title of the show is the title of the next game though. it gave me that vibe that the story is about to end.

To me it's a good harem in comparisons to other harems for picking an unexptected because if you already know which girl is definitely going to win, then the whole romance becomes boring in my opinion. Another reason why it's better than most harems is because the guy has the guts to confess as soon he realized which girl he loves the most, while most harems waste time without going anywhere and have dense protagonists who don't realize their feelings or when they do, they aren't able to confess because the universe is against them or they don't want to hurt the feelings of the other girls. They either have a harem ending or an open ending, or an ending where he picks his abuser, which is really frustrating\").\n\nAs for the girl he picked, I still fail to see how she was the worst one to you when there was that annoying maid, but I guess it's still a matter of preference."

She may still be mad at Tomoya, but deep down, she still cares for him. That scene was superb.\n\nWith Utaha's writing schedule for her new novel up and running and her soon to enter college, it's probably not likely she'll be involved in Blessing's second project.\n\nSame for Eriri, whose creativity seems to have completely halted since Winter Comiket.\n\nPS Fujoshi coffee shop attendants [ogling at some hot Izumi x Tomoya bromance](https://i.imgur.com/16bQvxC.jpg)."

   "text": "It's so frustrating to see how the adaptation is rushing the most important parts of the LN series.\n\nIt's to the point where anime only viewers are so focused on something that isn't the main issue (aka Kato apology/make up) instead of focusing on the real central problem/conflict of the series (which is Eriri's slump). Of course this is the anime adaptation to blame because they did an extremely poor job and skipped on a ton of important material....\n\nThey also cut out on a TON of Eriri x Tomoya moments. Pretty fucking ridiculous really and I'm not even a fan of Eriri lol... Same obviously goes for Utaha but her spotlight will come soon (if they delete this scene, I'll probably die of a brain tumor...).\n\nJust like last episode I guess time to point out what they missed this episode for the 1st 1/3 of Vol 7...\n\nThings that the anime adaptation skipped/changed:\n\n> Eriri and Tomoya spending time/pretty much all night together watching anime and cuddling.\n\n> Tomoya asking Eriri if she is in a slump and getting worried in his thoughts that he should stop her and set her up straight asap (THIS IS VERY FUCKING IMPORTANT as you will see in the last few episodes of this season).\n\n> Eriri also lashes out at Tomoya a little when Tomoya tries to put pressure on her to do the new cover illustration, saying that she thinks that they should drop it and it doesn't really seem necessary to make one (this is IMPORTANT as it shows Eriri knows she is not only in a slump, but also very desperate).\n\n> Iori also doesn't give chocolate to Tomoya in place of Izumi before Eriri at all. Eriri is the first person to give chocolate to Tomoya and he receives it when Eriri comes over to his house (which are shown in the points above).\n\n> Utaha and Tomoya have lunch in a burger shop, not in school (why does A-1 Pictures keep changing the locations? This shouldn't even be a problem for them). \n\n>Skipped a ton of Utaha x Tomoya banter, also Tomoya did not read Utaha's new LN prior to meeting Utaha (anime says he read it three times) and actually reads it in front of her while Utaha teases him with little spoilers.\n\n> Tomoya comments on Utaha's LN illustrator and Utaha tells him that he is a \"handsome playboy university student.\" (This bit is foreshadowing for a character that appears in Girls Side Vol 2 in the LNs and is one of the top three illustrators in the series, also makes an appearance in Koisuru Metronome spinoff manga).\n\n> Tomoya also has a ton of inner dialogue in this scene with Utaha where he feels extremely conflicted. He wants to congratulate her on her graduation but at the same time doesn't want her to go. A quote from the LN: \"I want to read senpai's new work as soon as possible. But I want to make a game with her as well. I want to always admire her, as her #1 fan. But I also want to be her co-worker and put in the effort together. I know this but, I'm just throwing a tantrum like a kid to Utaha senpai. I just want too much...\"\n\n> When Tomoya tells Utaha that he wants to continue the doujin group, Utaha asks him if he is going to continue a doujin group without any demanding passion and objective. Tomoya responds by saying that he doesn't want to put too much pressure on his group members when he barely works compared to Eriri and Utaha but Utaha cuts him off by saying that its his job as the director/producer to be demanding and that's the reason why she agreed to all his demanding requests before the game's official release.\n\n> Utaha also tells Tomoya that she has received multiple job offers from even big companies after she became famous for their VN's scenario writing.\n\n> And since they are in a burger shop, Eriri doesn't hear what Utaha is saying at all (she isn't even sneaking around).\n\n> Iori's [rouge en rouge] group vs Tomoya's [Blessing Software] VN sales competition ends in a 3000 :100 sales ratio lead for [rouge en rouge] aka the competition wasn't even close to a tie or gave Iori's group a real run for the money in terms of sales... However Iori does mention that the reviews for Tomoya's new VN is much better and due to Tomoya's group running out of stock, some people ended up buying Iori's VN instead during Comiket. \n\n> Iori also warns Tomoya to be careful/wary of Akane. Iori tells Tomoya that Akane is the original founder of rouge en rouge and after making it into a successful doujin group, moved onto working on much bigger things and such (VERY IMPORTANT PART DITCHED BY THE ADAPTATION).\n\n> The final scene with Tomoya writing up the rough draft for the \"Saekano\" VN project doesn't come until only after a brief but VERY important school day scene with Eriri where Eriri asks Tomoya for help in regards to what she should do about her slump. She feels like she can't get out of it by herself and just feels overall down, even saying \"do you think I need to keep being a creator?\" Tomoya tells her that he can't pressure her anymore and he will respect any path that Eriri takes in terms of illustrations (essentially Tomoya putting the problem away).\n\n> Tomoya during this small conversation with Eriri tells himself that in the past all he thought of Eriri's works were that they were just \"great\" but not \"outstanding\". However, after the events of volume 6 and seeing her illustrations after her getting sick and refueling her passion for drawing, he realized that she had drew her best illustrations yet, that far surpassed what he had ever seen before. Despite knowing that him putting pressure on Eriri will push her to becoming an even better illustrator and help her get out of her slump, he feels guilty in the fact that she fell sick during the arc of Volume 6 and is afraid to pressure her on.\n\n\nOverall, this part of the LN is supposed to focus HEAVILY on Eriri's slump as a creator and foreshadowing for certain characters and what may come to be. The adaptation seemed to turn the focus on Kato and Tomoya making up instead which makes honestly no sense at all... They also got rid of a ton of character interaction moments with Tomoya, Eriri and Utaha that further develops and shows just how close these three are and what they really think of each other. This is important for a series like Saekano where it's not the story that carries the series, but the characters and their relationships (which is also the main focus of the series itself).\n\nVery disappointing..."

The series has always had a huge focus on Tomoya's growth both as a scenario writer and a director/producer of a doujin group and the ending of volume 7 is the first true obstacle that Tomoya overcomes in the series as well gives him the boost/change in mindset that is shown in the later volumes (only to be broken down again slightly).\n\nUnless you think that the anime will have its own original ending instead of the volume 7 ending, that will just be disappointing in its own right."

Staring out the window.\n\nI guess I may have missed any bit where she was shown to be working hard on scripting, or like the rest of her work were we told and not shown by someone with a massive bias in her favour?\n\nI mean, the game was created about her, with a character based on her who looks like her while the circle was named after her and she began her involvement amongst a group of experienced creatives with no skills of her own. It's blindingly obvious she was dragged in to it because Tomoya has a thing for her and not because she had anything particularly to contribute. There's even points in S1 where he talks about all the members of the circle: the producer, the writer, the artist, the musician and the main heroine. One of those is not a useful creative position.\n\nI appreciate that noticing a promising musician and telling someone is helpful, but not exactly a job, nor is sitting there while an artist or developer talks at you to organise their thoughts. I'm more convinced by the 'team mum' point, which makes sense as those sorts of things are often done by someone not really able to contribute who wants to try and help somehow anyway.\n\nIf the show wants me to believe she worked really hard, it needs to show me and not just have a guy with a desperate crush say it about her. We were shown visibly how much the others put in to their aspects of the game and the effect it had on them (health and delays to paid work, both representing significant sacrifice).\n\nFor a show that is so well directed and delivered for the most part, to screw up \"show, don't tell\" like that is a little weird.\n\nI guess bias is a thing, but I ended S1 thinking Megumi was going to develop much more and probably liking her best, S2 made me re-evaluate her contributions to the team and role in the series. If anything my posts the last couple of weeks have been my pro-Megumi bias breaking down which made me think over all of this in a different light."
