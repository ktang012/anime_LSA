Now, Albus himself is attracted to girls, as we saw in the first episode when he talked about Sorena's huge boobs. So he's not grossed out that the guy is attracted to a woman. I think he's only grossed out because of age difference. Which would lead me to believe, along with her facial design (tiny mouth, large eye size for head), slender limbs, flat chest (even flatter in the manga/LN), and short stature that she is meant to be viewed as a loli.\n\nOnly real points against her being a loli are acting semi-maturely (being wise beyond her years), and having very, very slight curves.\n\nEdit: I will agree that all of the women in that town in this episode seemed to be very small. So the art style likely draws the women smaller. However, she's not much bigger in size than Albus who they constantly refer to as a child."

No overdramatic greater narrative, and no stretched fight scenes, but rather a fantastic and warm series about characters travelling and living their daily lives in a fantasy setting. I'm slowly starting to love this show, and I really hope it keeps this style up and doesn't bow down to a greater dramatic narrative.\n\nI still don't know why blondie is in this. He seems to have no real purpose in the series and is mostly just an annoying sidekick. If there's any major criticism I have on this series, it'd be him."
