Katou may not be the most expressive and blunt girl ever, but if real women we're ever that straightforward men would have a piece of cake maintaining relationships. She's hurt because from her POV Tomoya doesn't consider their friendship to be close enough that he would keep her in the loop for something as monumental as altering the end result of their project. It may not be evident from Megumi's demeanor but she genuinely likes these guys, quirky as they may be, and has had a lot of fun making this game. Katou put in the extra effort to set aside her plans for the weekend in case something happened (and it did) and worried deeply about Eriri's well-being last episode. People who are just working on a project in their spare time do not do these sort of things. Not to mention Megumi has put so much effort into the game, helping the him and the other girls anyway she can. \n\nNow you can argue that her reaction may be a little too much for a misunderstanding and inconsideration on the part of our LN Protag-kun but Megumi's whole characterization is based around \"real\" personalities. I've experienced first hand that women, especially one you're close to, can hold a grudge when they feel betrayed, not just get angry, brush off a slight, and make up like a tsundere haremette."

I think blessing soft aiming to release the full game on time during the winter comiket was primarily about generating buzz. For a new doujin circle, even one stacked with talent like theirs, it's difficult to generate the same level of excitement and word-of-mouth rep if solely released on a web platform. The winter comiket is also full of industry heavyweighs, so it's probably easier to find potential sponsors and future collaborators.  In the LN, their initial 100 copies generated significant buzz online for weeks, 1000 copies were sold out the first day it landed on store shelves, leading to 5k additional order."

Michiru still has her band and tthe game is good for promoting her music/her band. Also all three are doing things in their field so it's more practice and experience. Now Kato experience doesn't really help her future at all. In fact she probably is the most dedicated in the group and the fact that Tomoya left her in the dark wad practically a slap to the face.

Reminds me the fucking Oregairu Zoku adaptation (except this is much worse).\n\nLiterally re-reading the LN in my hands right now to get the details of what the anime adaptation decided to let go (despite most of these things being very fucking important).\n\nAlso got rid of very important dialogue and some scenes of Iori giving real bro advice and care for Aki which makes him the #1 bro of the series.\n\nHere are the important scenes/dialogue straight up cut out from the adaptation....:\n\n> Iori bringing medicine and changes of clothes picked out by one of his secetary coworkers in his doujin circle.\n\n> Iori telling Aki that if Aki doesn't tell his group about him going to visit Eriri who fell sick alone without telling anyone in 3 days after the fact some of his members may leave the group which Aki takes as a joke/little insult from Iori when Iori was actually giving him sound advice because Aki treats his members like his little minions with almost no full disclosure/trust when it comes to big issues like this.\n\n> Iori tells Aki that he should have sent someone else to take care of Eriri in his group while he works on the game because Aki is the fucking director with a deadline coming up and Aki flat out says that he can't trust anyone to do it himself because Utaha and Eriri hate each other (when in reality, these two have the utmost respect for each other) Eriri dislikes Michiru and he can't ask Kato to do it because he feels he uses her around too much. This was supposed to show that Aki has no real trust in his group and he almost cost his group the entire game project just because he couldn't trust others to help out when it counted the most.\n\n> Got rid of Aki and Eriri spending days together and having little cute interactions together like a couple... Aki cooking and feeding Eriri some soup to help her get through her illness and Eriri cooking breakfast for Aki and feeding him when he gets sick due to him not eating for an entire day because he was too occupied with treating Eriri's illness..\n\n> Got rid of the fact that THEY SPENT CHRISTMAS TOGETHER AND EVEN GOT RID OF THE MERRY CHRISTMAS GREETING RIGHT BEFORE THE CUT TO COMIKET AHHHHHH.\n\n> Totally got rid of Eriri telling Izumi about how she has changed now from before and has the courage to be able to surpass Izumi's growth, which was a sign of her growth both as a creator and a direct effect of her making up with Aki \n\n> Aki telling Iori that he can put 100% faith in the new Eriri while Eriri and Izumi have their own little conversation, which shows that Aki has improved in his trust issues when it comes to leaving his creators to do what they can without constant supervision and hindering the overall work progress.\n\n> Got rid of the ending parts where Kato tries to act indifferently to the trust issues that Aki had during the Eriri incident and tried to brush it off when Aki asks her what is wrong. She eventually cracks and tells everything to Aki like she did in this episode's ending.\n\nThis volume was supposed to show that Aki is willing to put everything in the line (even his dream project) for Eriri and later on Utaha (in vol 10+) because those two girls are the two people he respects the most by far.\n\nAnd since this happened, Kato is obviously pissed because of two reasons:\n\n1. Aki didn't trust her or the group enough and almost cost them an entire project they worked on their own free time and money (hint hint Utaha) for HIS SAKE...\n\n2. Aki didn't think about everyone else that put in so much effort into the project and decided to ditch all of that just for one person (in this case Eriri, and despite Kato and Eriri being best friends, which the anime does not display well... is still a huge no no to Kato).\n\n\n\nSo sad how Volume 6 was the Eririfag volume and also the second most important volume in the series (only after Volume 7), only to be rushed to fucking hell and beyond.\n\nAs a LN reader that has been following the series for years and spent quite the bucks on the series, it is sad to see the anime adaptation get so rushed, especially at the most important parts of the series...\n\nThough I'm an Utahafag, if they were gonna rush it, they should have given Volume 5 and GS 1 2-3 episodes and adapted Volume 6 with 3-4 episodes...\n\nI can only hope that Volume 7, the MOST IMPORTANT FUCKING ARC, doesn't get rushed to hell like this...

This episode has a lot of technical issues too like static crowds, poor in-betweening, poor layouts and poor foley (sound effects).\n\n[Example 1:](http://imgur.com/a/Bhhw6) I believe the fire in the fireplace is a video and not actually animated. The second problem is that the light doesn't flicker like a real fire does.\n\n[Example 2:](http://imgur.com/a/D9R1J) the last transition of her head movement is jittery because of improper/rushed in-betweens.\n\nThen the crowd at Comiket is sparse and mostly static. The scenes jump between different locations at the venue with no big establishing shot that can help us track their movement, which made me very disoriented."

Would you mind clearing up something for me? I'm still kinda confused about the conflict for this arc. \n\nInitially it seems that Eriri has hit a mental block because of their game's female protag's similarities to Katou? She can't imagine seeing the game's MC being with Katou-lite so she has trouble drawing the artwork. Aki tries to let Eriri fix her block herself but then Utaha lectures him for not trusting her? I know you say that he doesn't trust his teammates but that doesn't seem to be the issue here. \n\nIsn't the problem that he's too complacent in dealing with Eriri's block instead of directly addressing it? And how exactly did Eriri manage to get past her mental block, just pushing herself?"

Modelled for Eriri? Occasionally made comments in meetings? I don't understand and haven't since S1 what her role is beyond fodder for Tomoyas fantasies.\n\nAs an aside, this season has made me lean much more towards Eriri, seeing her attitude towards the project; rolling with the punches and putting out what she could to get things done."
