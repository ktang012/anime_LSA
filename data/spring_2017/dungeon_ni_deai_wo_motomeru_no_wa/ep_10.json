She's not exactly the talkative type, so unless they actually voice out her thoughts, you won't be able to understand her.\n\nHere, in the party, they just showed slight changes in expression. Meanwhile, in the manga, you could actually see what she was thinking... which was very interesting, in my opinion, and *not* something you can figure out by just slight changes in expression."

I'm definitely not a fan of how they're shoehorning her into pretty much everything they can. The bits with other characters like Finn or Riveria being trimmed down/out I don't mind so much, but the extra Lefiya fanservice with Loki was meh in addition to her taking up stuff for Tione or Tiona makes me crazy.\n\nAs for source adaptation, Ep 2 puts us not quite 3/4 of the way through the first volume of the LN.

I knew they would skip things but not that much so that they changed how they met the monsters. Even their fights were completely different. I'm a Lefiya fan in that I enjoyed her character growth in the manga and LN's and while she's definitely a main character in this side story, she's not the main one. I'm not really sure how I feel about it to be honest. Love Ais, Tione, Tiona and Lefiya in the manga and LN. I still going to watch this and hope for the best. All I can do as a fan. On a side note.

Her character trope is kind of overdone admittedly. It's kind of odd how they've shifted the focus from Aiz to her, but when you think about it most of Aiz's dialogue in the LN is internal and wouldn't translate well to anime... she doesn't talk that much. They have to use other events to show what she's thinking. \n\nThis episode felt more natural than the first. Hopefully the quality continues to increase!\n\nEdit: wow a lot of people not enjoying this. You have to remember that it's a side-story and not intended to be a continuation of the main plot. I do really hope we get a Season 2 out of it, though."

Despite being near the top in terms of fighters she's still enamored in becoming more powerful. No wonder she's certainly interested in a boy that [Danmachi spoils](/s \"goes from inexperienced to competent at fighting in a matter of months\")\n\nAnyway all I'm gonna say is that the dress looks quite familiar to those who watched Danmachi and you can get a good idea on what will happen next episode.\n\n"
