It was funny as well.\n\nThis show takes itself seriously if you consider the mad logic as a part of the world they are in, by no means it pretends to be realistic. Even so, the fight techniques are over the top and well explained (most of them). The OP shows that perfectly with those smooth cutscenes of the MC fighting each Sword and then the Empress, the fights are the best part of this messed up looney school.\n\nTHEY EVEN HAVE THE WEAPONS IN PE CLASSES. That seems uncomfortable AF! [But Ok](http://i.imgur.com/fGGuo6H.jpg) \n\nA fucking bear, I don't know how to react to that... This show is going for a good path, I already like it more than most battle harems, because the battles are cool and the girls are cute! I liked the Three Senpai Musketeers but the new girl didn't felt unique like the rest, they wanted to give her quirks (the Cola, coming back from Hawaii, the cutest bear ever, etc) but it wasn't enough, atleast for now.\n\nAnyway, I liked this episode, even more than the previous three.\n"
