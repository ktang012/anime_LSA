It just makes sense, Sana IS Wonderland, so if he can make Sana behave then he can definitely make Wonderland go back to normal.\n\nThis show was seriously a surprise for me, I love how it went from an supernatural show to an SoL then back to being supernatural. With the way things ended though I'm guessing there's more to it? Like what's gonna happen now that people with powers will be normal? Surely there's gotta be a follow up season right?\n\nAlthough that ending with older Sana thanking Zoroku (I'm guessing she's visiting his grave ;_;) made it feel like it won't.

After seeing this episode I'm changing my What I Watched, WIE, WIG on the show to [this](https://i.imgur.com/LrS0HUD.png).\n\nSanae and I had pretty much [the same reaction](https://i.imgur.com/YEVWYVc.jpg).\n\n...the way too realistic [ending](http://i.imgur.com/nwnZWAT.png) got me like \n\n[](#trynottocry),\n\nbut I'm glad to see Sana grown up and still caring for Zouroku.\n\n---\n\nAs for my opinion on the show, ... the ~first five episodes (until Sana was rescued) were kind of weird and I didn't really understand what was the studio trying to do or where they wanted to go, but after that it turned into a nice, relaxing show, with some amusing moments.\n\nI liked quite a lot how Sana was depicted, she was actually a kid, nothing more than that. And the rest of the characters were somehow acting according to their age ([especially Zouroku](https://imgur.com/nnwVNui)), and you don't get to see something like this too often.\n\nSo for once we've got to see something different to the overly mature teenager, whose emotional psychology doesn't correspond at all to their age. There are other shows that do the same thing, but there are not many. Sometimes we need shows like this (at least that's true for me).\n\nIn the end there were (a lot of) things left unexplained, inconsitencies and lack of commitment to the plot (read the synopsis, watch the first five episodes, and then rest of the show), animation problems, but I consider them irrelevant at this point. I've kind of got what I expected from the show and I'm happy with that. \n\nMy final score for MAL is 8/10 (perhaps it's too much, at least accoring to the avg score), on a bigger scale I'd give it somewhere between 73 and 78 of 100 points I guess.\n\nMaybe not all of you agree with that, but take your complaints to the [big man](http://i.imgur.com/sB1mATS.png), see if he cares.\n\n---\n\nIf you think about watching it, give it a try. Keep in mind that the pace changes after the 5th episode and some things just don't add up, and there's not way it'll get a second season."

I have two main points, but I'll start with saying I was [*very*](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/630bmf/spoilers_alice_to_zouroku_episode_1_discussion/dfqvag3/) excited about this series after watching the first episode, and I hyped it up a *lot* for myself. Now in my original post, I said this has the potential to be my favorite anime of all time... it's not. \n\n*However*, if I were to make a top 5 list of sorts, I'd have to fit this somewhere in there without a doubt. It's a 10/10 for me, it played with all of my favorite tropes, and made a fantastic story to me (I can't wait for the source to be translated!). I stopped reading these discussion threads after the third episode because they were starting to harbor a lot of negativity, and negativity just spawns more negativity. Avoiding these threads allowed me to enjoy the series *immensely*. \n\nMy second reason for commenting, is I want to dismiss /r/anime's massive circle jerk of too much hype ruins everything when it doesn't reach expectations. \n\n*I couldn't have been less hyped* for this show after watching the first episode. It didn't reach my expectations at all of course, if it had, it'd have been my favorite anime, as my linked comment proposed. I've already expressed my love for Alice to Zouroku. So a good show is a good show, if it fails it isn't because of some arbitrarily excessive hype generated before it takes off. It fails because it's just bad. "

Sana had Zouroku as the parental figure, and everyone needs one of those to lead them through their journey.

Talking about stupid moves, the whole thing to keep Ichijo out of the picture in these two episodes just to make Sana & Hatori the main attraction is just a poor call from the writters & director; you can always make shorter shots of your side charaters instead of just taking them away. Heck, all of the main characters are gathered in the same place aside the exit wich Ayu miraculously found, yet Ichijo has to go aaaaaall the way back to the lab entrance wich took 10 earth days for Zouroku & Sanae to cover, but she does it in a matter of seconds. And why the heck does she do that? you know they have phones in modern Tokyo, there was no need other than to reunite her with the clingy Noriko whom she doesn't like anyway.\n\nThey never explained how the heck was Sana able to comunicate thru the rabbit back in episode 9 when she abducted Ayu, wich now seems an entity of it's own that loves to tease others. And neither did it bother to explain why Sana's powers were cancelled by Hatori's prescene in wonderland when they both could use them freely in the real world. \n\nThe japanese goverment makes an announcement about the Dreams of Alice appearing out of nowhere to anyone with no discrimination. I mean, a whole ferris wheel appeared in the middle of Tokyo and no one seemed freightened or shocked? how about the mere thought of a whole 18 wheeler poping out in the sky and falling down on top of somebody's head or building killing several to hundreds of people. That's exactly the kind of information a goverment completely buries and denies knowledge of it.\n\nThe last shot with an older Sana is so out of place, as if she was the one narrating the story from the beginning, wich she wasn't.\n\nDownvote away because peeps think that button is a dislike button.\n\n[](#lifeishard)"

It would have been more acceptable if they **didn't add** the shots of the goverment broadcast, because it just sounds retarded and further than adding actual background story it just raises more questions. It actually brings some more questions what were the author and the adaptation writters thinking when they thought \"hey it would be a good idea to create innumerable hazards for a population and not a single one of them actually worring about their own safety\"\n\n>No, she did, in the first episodes about 9 minutes in, when Sana is on top of the tower; practically introducing the story.

Sure, one can interpret them as meaningless and the situation not making any sense, but at that point one is practically trying to think badly of the show.\n\nAnother overexageration of yours trying to patch a badly directed episode.\n\nYou call 2 shots in this episode an absurd amount of time? really? The pancake shot and the bento shot. That's it. Oh and the montage where Sana kisses his forehead, but even that's diluted by Sana's more important dialogue with Hatori. \n\nThe scenes were important to stablish the connection of Sana with wonderland. But if what you say that Zouroku deliberately yelled at wonderland because he knew that would cause a positive reaction in this world, then why didn't he yell earlier during his trail with Sanae, and not until they reached the portal where Sana was? Lecturing wonderland earlier would have hastened a lot the search for the two missing girls. \n\nStablishing this, you cannot state without reasonable doubt that Zouroku acted on purpouse. If there was an \"internal monologue\" of him understanding this principle and acting reasonable, sure, I'd give you the reason. But the thing is that your brain is filling the gaps left by the writter, and you can't **state** Zouroku acted with knowledege; specially based on his behaviour during the whole series of yelling to others because that's his trait. You can \"guess\" at most he acts deliberately, but you can't **state** he acted deliberately without reasonable doubt.\n\n>Well, to be fair, if Ichijou was one's favourite character that is quite annoying.\n\nCheck your punctuation. I don't understand wheter you're saying Ichijou is an annoying character, or the fact that she was taken out of these episodes is annoying.\n\n>It does add important background story, and leaves out other stuff that is obvious and doesn't fit into the time frame. I really don't see the problem with that.\n\nYou're contradicting yourself. You stated that the addition of the japanese goverment uptake cutscene didn't hinder a character focused story. And now you're saying that it is an important piece of information. And here's your quote:\n\n>Skipping over the whole people are freaking out thing and most of the political problems and jumping straight to the conclusion is a slightly confusing move, but **including that wouldn't really add anything of importance** to the character-focused story, so it's quite fine.\n\nI'm going to tell you why it wasn't important to add that scene. Because this show like many others is just a big commercial to buy the mangas afterwards. The show isn't going to get a second season; so, why add a convoluted farfetched cutscene that raises more questions, if the story isn't going to be continued in this format? Afterall, what the audience wants are more moments of Sana and Zouroko, not terrible written political background story.\n\n>In a book, yes. But in film starting with an audio narration at the beginning and ending with one is very common\n\nThat's your opinion, but it doesn't make it true. I've seen more \"films\" using the narrator as a part of the storytelling on constant basis during the film, from classics like \"stand by me\" to more contemporaneous ones like \"Gone baby gone\" that switches narrators throughout the story. This format in this particular case feels like a last minute call to shock the audience \"ah, it was Sana the one telling the story\" but no one remembers it because her introduction was very vague and forgettable in that frst episode.\n\n>I can't even start to comprehend how this can be a problem to someone.\n\nThat's your problem. There will always be people who like to use their brains and question terrible format presentations."

Minnie-c was a deranged character thinking only on her dead husband, and her motivation was to take Sana back to the lab, anything else wasn't a priority. She could have killed Zouroku in that instant and still take Sana to the lab.

But that's not how the cookie crumbles. And I asure you there are always people that enjoy threads that have different opinions about a show than a whole resonating echo of \"it's 10/10, AOTS, new my favorite anime\" and so.\n\nFor the record, I did find the show enjoyable for the most part.

It tried to mix two completely different genres, sci-fi action and slice of life, but the story still ended up feeling like two completely different series competing for the same space.\n\nStill, I liked it enough to keep following it and the characters and interaction between them were so good to watch, especially of Sana and Zouroku. 7/10."

   "text": "More than anything, this show gives an impression of being from a way longer source material that couldn't be reasonably fit into 12 episodes. It's not that I want more episodes in general, or even that I felt like there was anything specific the show needed to go into more (although there were a lot of obvious dropped threads), but rather that it felt like the source was something longer with a lot of arcs and they couldn't find a satisfying way to fit it into the 12-episode format. Breaking it into two arcs with some SoL in between just made it feel less cohesive and confused about what it's aiming for, and it didn't let each arc feel impactful enough. As an anime, Alice to Zouroku had a lot of potential and there were a lot of ways it could have gone, but it failed to achieve any of them. But it's the type of failing that suggests reading the source.\n\nI didn't really care about the institution, but I liked Wonderland. Before the show started I was hoping for the SoL to overtake the institution plot but now I wish the show focused more on Sana's nature as an extension of Wonderland, since that's the most interesting aspect. Since that part ties in well with the SoL aspects of the show, it wouldn't have to lose out that part either. Obviously the show wants to have a theme about how Sana should be treated as a normal person, but that's less interesting to me than the specifics of what makes her special.\n\nI didn't really feel anything about most of the characters so the SoL bits as well as many of the conflicts fell flat. I expected a lot more interactions between Sana and Zouroku than Sana with the rest of the world. I wanted to see more of him in the final arc, and to see more depth in his character. Since the SoL is most of what makes this show stand out, overall this didn't work out for me. I did like the scene with him telling off Wonderland, though.\n\nThe way the show ended (other than the narration by older Sana) seemed to suggest that Sana and Hatori had lost their powers since it never showed them regaining them. I assume that can't be the case though. Overall the ending dropped a lot of necessary explanations to make the sci-fi plot work, so it feels more like it just forgot."

   "text": "He actually went all the way through Wonderland **just to lecture it**, what a character, at least the premise of the show remains until the end.\n\nI felt like this series was... Poorly inspired. Alice in Wonderland stuff, powers, the relation between an old man (and what an old man, probably my favorite character) and an almost alien little girl (and what a little girl, probably my favorite character). It has lots of great ideas piled up (especially in the second arc) but the most original and creative one was Ichijo (almost, I'm sure I saw that before), and she didn't get the attention she deserved.\n\nThe ending, with Adult Sana (knew it) telling a story reminded me of Zero Kara (also this season) and its \"and our characters lived more adventures just like this one, now go to the original source if you want to find it out\" last minutes. But then, a lot of anime does that.\n\nThis was a fun watch, it even got sentimental at times, but at the end it was a bit beyond average, I'll give this one a good 7, maybe 7,5 if they make an OVA. A second season would be welcomed, since this sole cour felt like too different stories. Would watch again."
