   "text": "It seems to me, however, that her position does not make sense on several levels.\n\nOne. She has great faith in human dignity and human ability to persevere and reach their full potential without being bootstrapped. In doing so, she puts manmade concepts like dignity above maximization of happiness for individual beings. It's not exactly dignified for any person to suffer through no fault of their own (say, from a terminal disease, war, or systemic poverty) when they know their condition can be improved by tweaking a variable in the Matrix. And, of course, there is a question of whether humanity could have discovered the universe outside their box without external influence.\n\nTwo. She considers maintaining the rules of the game mandatory for human achievements to matter. But is this really true? Humans are great make-believers. They create arbitrary contests of skill and ability and enjoy them precisely because all participants consent to the rules. An MMO guild that after weeks of tries killed a difficult raid boss has shown a noteworthy performance of individual skill, coordination and perseverance. The satisfaction they experience is very much genuine and is not rendered worthless by the fact that neither the boss nor their characters are real. What is important, however, is consent. In order for a game to hold merit, all participants must know they are playing a game, they must know the rules, and they must have an option to walk away and do something else. And if they're not aware of this fact, then an external safeguard must interfere and remind everyone that they are, in fact, higher-dimensional entities with most of their functions locked away, which is exactly what zaShunina does.\n\nThree. She does not want to create catastrophic change and upheaval. The truth is, humanity's accelerating scientific and technological progress generates comparable upheaval all on its own. The old way of life will give way to the new, and, in spite of all the peril along the way, humanity can and will adapt. Some - by going forward. Some - by preserving a legacy. If an artisan, such as Saraka's \"father\", can find meaning in metal handicraft in this age of cheap and easy mass manufacturing, he will do so even if we get the ability to manipulate reality itself.\n\nFour. While individuals can find meaning on any scale, it is extremely unsettling for an individual to have no say on the largest scale they are aware of. If someone knows they live in a simulation that can be turned off at any moment, they won't be able to live their lives to the fullest. Some would become terminally depressed, while others would try their darndest to claw their way up from the Petri dish to a level where they are on par with their experimenters.\n\nFive. For all extents and purposes, sending zaShunina back now would be locking the barn when the cows have escaped. The process has already started and it would continue unless someone presses a convenient reset button for the entire Earth. Whatever the \"right answer\" is, it can't be a return to ignorance. I'd hate to see the final episode show everything having never happened and Shindo still negotiating mildly exciting bureaucracy issues.\n\n---\n\nThat being said, it pains me to see zaShunina's stoicism and patience finally give way in favor of cartoon villainy because for some reason he refuses to wait any longer while the seeds he sowed bear fruit. He is doing what he does because he firmly and compassionately believes that sentient entities deserve self-determination and knowledge of the truth to any extent they can comprehend. What he did to Shindo, however, utterly disregards this as he flat out treats him like an object rather than a subject, to be manipulated freely. Such paternalist hypocrisy appears to be extremely inconsistent with his desire to free humanity from their cage.\n\n---\n\nIn short, we're having a radical shift in tone here from the series' strong point - thoughtful evaluation of human reaction to change - to a personal drama, which simply does not seem dignified at the scale of the issues at hand. Not after an entire season of showing every single character do their best to be objective and put personal pet peeves aside. Perhaps both of the anisotropic beings have adopted far too many human faults. zaShunina's confrontation with Saraka might end up a simple contest of ego headbutting rather than a meaningful philosophical discourse on the right thing to do. Hopefully both of them would realize they are going in a fundamentally wrong direction and arrive at a solution that actually lets individual humans have a say in the matter."

Every time Kado teleports a human, or theyre processed by it (like the people on the plane), my educated guess is that its not really just moving them from one place to another, but something much simpler - decomposing them into the most basic components and rebuilding them in a new location. So I would say he has been killed and replaced probably more than a couple of times by now, just not violently (in the way that might trigger this ring thing)."

So while some of this could turn out true its literally assumptions  based on theories that i came up with immediately after watching Ep. 9 and reading a couple comments here. I guess my point for now is, since I dont know any of this for sure it technically cant be a *?SPOILER?* even if it turns out to be correct. I think. lol ~-~ \n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nWith what little info we have I'm assuming AT LEAST part, if not all, of her Awareness\\\"True Persona\" was sealed along with her powers. Or maybe just partitioned and running separately if that makes sense. Either way, I feel its obvious that zaShunina's attempt at hurting a human or possibly Shindo in particular is what \"awakened\" her. I say Shindo because part, if not all of her, apparently likes him.\n\nTo further my major assumption, i would like to point out that a being with her powers wouldn't have bothered practically begging the science chick to break into Kado if she could literally do it by hand. I would assume if she had some kind of personal issue in doing it herself, she would have seemed troubled over the decision to do it or not. Instead she focuses on the physics grad student being able to possibly do it, insinuating that she had no knowledge of her own abilities at that point.\n\nHowever!\nThis is a good show so it can be a little unpredictable but IMO the only way its not ^this^ or something really close is if they crap out some major reason for her to consciously choose to hide; all the while having been fully aware of her own identity. Something like now shes gonna die soon or has someone she needs to hide from ect.\n\n(This is starting to go on forever, especially when no one cares lol.)\nTo sum it up i would literally bet the story on her is gonna go like so: She either made this universe, or was at some point put in charge of it. Then at some point humans miraculously appear. Next she decides that the original plan is gonna hurt the humans somehow, and finally decides to make the ring to seal her powers, most of her knowledge, and parts of her personality. The reasons for this are 1.-To not have an effect on humans.(This covers helping her blend in with them) \nand maybe a 2nd.- To hide from the bad guy or guy(s).\n\nAs i was going over this MASSIVE comment before posting I thought of 1 major problem with the theory...... She has parents, so either she has screwed with those peoples memories or operates on some weird reincarnation lol... Major whole in the entire hypothesis but to tie this all together i still say some or maybe a lot has to be right :0\n\nThus concludes my drawn out pointless essay, if you read this far I'm more impressed with that then whatever possessed me to type all of this crap lol."

But since he seems to imply that they created our universe, and from the fact that his third contribution seems to essentially be an admin console that manipulates our physical laws, I drew the conclusion that the situation was essentially equivalent to being inside a simulation.\n\nIt was also interesting to think of it in this way, because it explains how he could just create these devices that break conservation of energy, and give our minds essentially the ability to sleep in a subroutine, because if it is all just a computer program, then these kinds of things are just simple modifications to a few variables in the program. \n\nI suppose that the one thing that may be different in this case is that there may be a possibility that humanity can go to the anisotropic, which, when we think of simulations, isn't something that we think of as possible in a simulation. But, suppose we also created an incredibly advanced simulation, complete with intelligent beings we can communicate with, and then one day gave them admin access to the computer (by accident or otherwise), it would be possible for them to \"escape\" from the simulation, if they just accessed the Internet, commissioned robot bodies for themselves, and then uploaded their consciousnesses onto these bodies (obviously I'm assuming a lot of future technology here, but the technology to stimulate millions of intelligent beings would be considerable, so this isn't too unreasonable).\n\nThe real difference, I guess, comes down to how our universe was created in the world of Kado. Whether it is indeed quite like a program, or whether it was grown or cultivated, more like a farm. It may be the case that it fits both cases quite well, or that neither set of characteristic describe the actual situation properly."

   "text": " Japanese is very contextual. It's a terrible language to take literal word by word. \n\nDue to the context of this scene, Hanamori is  on a fishing expedition. He uses the \"you like him..\" as an ice-breaker question. Prior to the last episode, she was very reserve and standoff-ish towards Shindo. She's warmed up a bit since than and Hanamori is interested to know what made her change her mind about Shindo.  It's not so much important rather or not she's romantically interested in Shindo that Hanamori is attempting to expose. But rather, Hanamori indirectly acknowledging the recent change in her behavior is because of Shindo's awesome-ness. Shindo's Kanji means \"Path of Righteousness\".\n\n  Under this context, his \"suki\" is  meant in a way of saying, \"Shindo is such a cool dude, I completely understand how you'd change meeting a guy like him. He has that sort of effect on people. He has changed me as well.\" Hanamori seems like a natural wimp but Shindo has put him in positions to be a better man. Hanamori's Kanji is \"Flower Forrest\" and his first name means \"moment.\" Japanese poetry likes to compare a person's potential to that of a flower. Hanamori is person, who is only capable of doing things if put in the right moment. In the right moment, his potential is the most ripe. Just like a forest full of blossoming flowers. \n\nAnyhow, Hanamori mentions Natsume liking him, only to confirm how cool Shindo is. Natsume is a very serious character. Not someone to strike you as a person who'd just willy-nilly like any guy. So her liking him and saying she's not good enough for him, only points to how epic Shindo is. Then this whole conversation makes way for Tsukai explaining her ring. \n\nBeing so, I don't think conversation was romantic based. In Japanese, \"suki\" only really means something when said directly to the person you like face to face or confessing to a friend who you like. If not said directly or to a friend, it's not a strong sense of like. May be just a passing fancy or something platonic. Also, it seems completely unnatural for a Japanese person to expect another person, who they don't know well, to tell them who they like. Hanamori has an actual relationship with Natsume, so her \"suki\" of Shindo carries a lot of weight. Notice how shock his  face was in the flashblack he had with her.  He doesn't really have much of a relationship with Tsukai, so he didn't really expect anything earth shattering from their convo.  Just maybe, an agreement of the epicness of Shindo; which he was able to confirm from her blushing. \n"

Also he doubles down on how it's her \"chance\" after prefacing that Natsume likes Shindou as well. \n\nI do get what you mean by Japanese being contextual though and your explanation makes sense. It's just way, way easier to Occam's Razor this and say Hanamori is in love with Shindou lol.  "

   "text": "Looks like this might take a turn for the disappointing. There were a few warning signs earlier that I ignored though, so it doesn't come completely out of nowhere. The treatment of the UN as something that would unfairly block progress instead of where people would voice valid concerns against the Wam, whether or not that would be accurate, indicated the show wasn't really about humans grappling with different viewpoints about specific pros and cons of zaShunina's offers or about human progress. The opponents to the Wam didn't seem to get a fair chance to argue, and Japan's choice to circumvent the UN's vote was based on a really unsatisfying argument that no one had the chance to debate. It seemed like progress was being pushed as the right answer without people properly debating each step, and then Tsukai's speech about the value of humanity accomplishing various feats on their own was given too much relative narrative weight. So if it's that the story was about zaShunina forcing humanity forward by recruiting sympathetic allies, and that Tsukai is the force stopping him, that would certainly be consistent with the twist. It's just not the show I was hoping for.\n\nRegardless of zaShunina's specific views, his tropes are essentially aligned with being an evil alien trying to destroy humanity. Which would set him up as a villain instead of what the show suggested at the start: you don't try to win against your opponent, but you'll get a better result by ensuring both parties are happy with the result. There hasn't been much detail about how the Sansa is affecting humanity and the spread of the Wam was last described as having been drastically slowed down (although the Sansa seemed like it should override that) so they might even go for a reversal of those two changes to humanity. That would be immensely disappointing. I can already get that sort of development from other stories. The show might not go in that direction though, so of course I'll keep watching. There are too many episodes left for zaShunina vs Tsukai to be the climax, after all, and Shindo is still the genius negotiator protagonist.\n\nI wish zaShunina threatened Shindo with a pink cube instead of an energy sword. Just describing what it does would make it threatening enough and it would be scarier to see a formerly harmless-seeming technology become a threat than any generic magic blade weapon could be. It would also seem less like zaShunina is down with murder if he was just trying to erase an unwanted instance of Shindo than trying to cut him down."

Those are just simple program parameters that you could alter, and the Nanomis-hein is just an admin console with access to fundamental forces. (You have free access of time, so Sansa could be achieved by just every 16 hours executing a subroutine that has the human sleep in another dimension, but at 1000000x speed so that they finish almost instantly. Alternatively, do it in parallel so that it takes zero time effectively) \n\nOf course, these things do take energy, but it should be minuscule, just like how creating objects in Minecraft with creative mode doesn't actually take much energy irl, since you're just flipping some electronic bits.\n\nNot necessarily implying that the anisotropic is much less impressive than we at first thought. ZaShunina claims they have \"infinite processing power\", which isn't infinite energy, but it's impressive nonetheless. "

First, he could have made amends instead. Second, he could have simply not made the dumb ass mistake in the first place and kept quiet. Seriously, wtf, ZaChina? \"come with me to the anisotropic!\" Are you gay or something for the MC? Totally unnecessary. Is your love for the MC greater than the good of your entire anisotropic? Are you greedy for that information or something? What happened to sharing the bread?!\n\nEither case, in the unlikely event that it happened, and it fucking happened, we could use someone to stop ZaChina. Clearly it's not going to be Shindo, the weak-ass human. Unless he ass-pulled massive anisotropic super-powers and made ZaChina go \"bakana! how could you become so powerful in ~~magic~~ ~~ninjutsu~~ ~~kamehameha~~ ~~nen~~ the anisotropic in such a short time!\" Which thank god didn't happen. So it had to be another anisotropic being which was conveniently hanging around there.\n\nThis is too cliche. I'm honestly disappointed by how cliche it is. It basically wasted the whole anime. Failure of a writer pulling this crap just because he wants a MC every human or alien girl or guy wets their panties for. Absolute bullshit.\n\nWays it could have been much better:\n\n1. Desperate Shindo uses his negotations skills (LMAO AS IF HE HAS ANY) to escape death by replacement and sweet-talks an alien in some Doctor Strange levels of inversed power play\n2. Shindo dies. New Shindo is up. New Shindo finds out the truth all the same and ZaChina starts to change his mind as he still can't convince the Nth Shindo to come to the anisotropic play with dimensions.\n3. Shindo accepts the fucking proposal of the thing he just thought was a fucking God instead of hesitating. Seriously learn something from the ancient greek/romans/aztecs\n4. ZaChina does not act like he is the fucking actually retarded anisotropic kid who ended up in a job about nursing universes and was put in charge of the shittiest universe while being told it was the greatest miraculous universe so he would shut his babbling mouth up and stop eating books with glue\n5. ZaChina gets drunk from a beer, totally wasted, starts laughing and anisotropically-spawning dicks around the world instead of his usual arms. Humanity stops taking him seriously after such travesty. He needs Shindo to make humanity accept the 4th device. Next 12 episodes focus on making the slogan \"ZaChina is not a bundle of dicks\" stick.\n\nAnyway, that humanity needs to grow itself speech from the alien feels even more stupid now. Even somewhat patronizing. I wish this anime go better instead of worse. It's already filled with scientific errors / bullshit despite being a mostly science-based anime. If the plot goes to shit too, it won't have any redeeming qualities."

Is it wise to even judge a being by something so arbitrary and transient which might not even be accepted in the next 50 years? \n\nTo ZaShunina, our morals don't apply, we are his plants he seeded. The morals that apply to him are one's who were created by HIS society, he doesn't belong in our society, is not a part of it, and thus cannot be judged by it. It is akin to judging a gorilla for beating a kid and calling the gorilla evil, which makes zero sense as the gorilla has an entirely different world view, and ethics (very rudimentary, but they have some).\n\nAnd, ZaShunina is not even a sentient being, the word sentient was made by us, and as he has said before, our words don't translate very well and lose meaning when you talk about the anisotropic. \n\nZaShunina is an entirely foreign phenomenon, we can't even term his as living because he comes from the place which has 37 dimensions, we can't even imagine a single speck of the 5th dimension. You want to assign morals to a fucking phenomenon? \n\n>This does not compute. Seriously though, humanity is a product of evolution which is a product of the laws of physics.

He set the basic physical constant of the universe, and those gave rise to stars and galaxies. The makeup of the human mind is dependent more on the concentration of elements on their planets, and the physical conditions rather than the finely tuned universal constants. \n\nA alien from a different planet is expected to look different because he evolved in a completely different physical conditions. His brain makeup would be different and very different even under the same rules which ZaShunina set. This means, the universal constants set by his kind are just for the universe to not collapse on itself and the life which it generates are more dependent on physical conditions than his initial conditions otherwise aliens would be the same as humans. \n\nYour analogy is the worst I have ever seen in my life. When you drop a hammer from a window, you KNOW that it might hit someone on the ground. Saying that you are not responsible is stupid because you had prior information about the beings that exist with you and one of them might be on the exact same spot that you threw the hammer on. \n\nIn case of ZaShunina, he doesn't know that the universe will spawn ANY life as he already told that ours is the only one which formed it, while millions failed. And he is not directly responsible for what even form since there are nearly infinite variables which determine human formation and he cannot be held responsible for the way our brains are formed since he can't even calculate WHICH conditions are responsible for our formation otherwise he would not have needed to have to make a billion different universes with different conditions as he would already know what conditions are needed. \n\nHe isn't even harming humans in the first place, he just wants our information like a copy paste rather than cut paste, while making sure we survive and become gods of our universe.

ZaShuina clearly states that what they want is large amounts of information production. It doesn't seem to matter what form that information takes, we just happened to fit the criteria. All he wants is information. Not life, not humans, not intelligence, not morals, not sentience, just _information_.\n\nHonestly, this whole comment of yours is the most irrational crap I've read all day, and that's saying a lot since I read politics."

   "text": "The reason I watched this anime was because it was hard science fiction with a fascinating hitherto unexplored premise, of an alien godlike lifeform carefully, thoughtfully guiding humanity to a new stage of evolution and being changed by this interaction in turn. That's all been thrown out the window. Instead of succeeding, Seikaisuru Kado just degenerated into a dime-in-a-dozen predictable anime that has a moe mahou shoujo teaming up with humanity to save the day from the suddenly inexplicably evil alien overlord.\n\nSpecifically:\n\n1/ Shindou would have come with him into the anisotropic if zaShunina gave him more than a minute to wrap his head around something that would give anyone pause. Shindou's never been reluctant, he's always gone along with zaShunina, yet the likely immortal anisotropic being couldn't wait a little? He's been so patient with Shindou before, but now it's like, you have failed me because you didn't instantly agree, so die. Is he on some schedule we don't know about?\n2/ He created a double of Shindou hours before inviting him to join him in the anisotropic, so he could start over just in case Shindou didn't jump at the chance. Bit premature? Nothing stopping him from creating the copy after Shindou refused. I mean, if Shindou had agreed, what then? Was zaShunina just going to destroy standby-Shindou then or keep him around in case Shindou failed him in the future?\n3/ Why did zaShunina not contact Tsukai before/upon arriving? Why didn't Tsukai contact him? From what I gather the universe humans inhabit is the ultimate cocoon, a miracle, yet its administrator doesn't communicate with one of the head honchos, or whatever zaShunina is? Do anisotropic beings not talk to each other? Is there no protocol? \n4/ Why did Tsukai sow doubt in Shindo\u2019s heart? What did she expect him to do? Influence zaShunina? Work with her against him? She knew it was zaShunina she should talk to all along and yet by making Shindou doubt she put him in danger. Then she says \u201cI have a bad feeling.\u201d and proceeds to waste time trying to find another way into Kado that wouldn\u2019t force her to reveal who she is, because why? Humanity already knew about zaShunina, so why is it such a big problem they'd know about her?\n\nI could go on but frankly I'd rather forget I ever invested even a moment in Seikaisuru Kado such is my disappointment. Toei Animation wasted the potential of such a promising anime."

   "text": "Agreed with your overall summary, but I think some of your points are incorrect.\n\n1.) I don't think it was so much about giving him a minute as much as it was Shindo being utterly terrified after zaShunina made him wait, confused, for 70 hours (almost 4 days!) without food and water. He completely ruined their relationship, likely permanently, and he wanted to undo his mistake.\n\n2.) He didn't create the double hours before. The device Shindo steps into likely copies all of his information - all the particles in his body - and recreates him on the other side. He probably has the information of Shindo (almost like a blueprint) stored for every time he traveled with that mechanism. He can have Kado build him using that information whenever he wants, so he's always been prepared. He didn't create the clone hours beforehand, he had just \"saved\" Shindo's state at the moment of him taking the device. Hence why he hesitated and insisted on him using it. And, if Shindo had agreed, he wouldn't have created the new Shindo. Nothing to destroy.\n\n3.) It is surprising that he didn't know about who she is. Clearly he knows that every universe has an administrator, and he probably knows that what he's doing will not be accepted by the administrator. Perhaps Tsukai got wind of what zaShunina was preparing to do as he built Kado and the other devices in preparation of entering our universe, and hid her identity from him. He knew there was an administrator, but not who. From her point of view, this may have been the best option. It's possible that a fight between two anisotropic beings may jeopardize the entire universe, so she'd prefer to avoid it peacefully.\n\n4.) Yes, I think she was hoping Shindo would influence zaShunina and convince him to take it a little slower. I'm not sure what she was hoping to gain from breaking into Kado, but the benefit of keeping her true nature hidden is huge. She's clearly in the camp that believes that the universe - and humanity - is better off without their interference. She almost definitely doesn't want humanity to know their true history, to know it was all created by the anisotropic beings. Her showing up wouldn't be just like zaShunina, it'd destabilize the situation and escalate things quickly. She was observing quietly, trying to influence him from the sidelines, and see if the situation could be resolved smoothly. That's what her ring symbolized - her faith in zaShunina not to fuck things up. He fucked things up.\n\nBasically, the way I see it, zaShunina got impatient watching humanity grow, and wants to help them accelerate at whatever cost. She was overseeing the world, and sees him as a threat, but her core philosophy is non-interference and observation. It was only after he took it too far that she had to put her foot down.\n\nCertainly not the way I imagined the story to go, but I'm curious to see where they go with it."
