   "text": "This is hands down the best episode so far.\n\n[](#kayosmile)\n\nThe animators did a great job reflecting the angst and [despair from Riri](http://imgur.com/qMD6R2U.jpg) in the bridge shootout. Tanaka Chiemi did a great job doing Riri's voice in a more monotone frigthened tone than her rather usual Kuudere tone. Damn it Maki, you do know when to [drop the jerk](http://imgur.com/5DAj17u.jpg) act and contribute to the cause. Boosting Riri's confidence to conquer her fears on treating people was such a great step for both characters. Such a shame we won't see Riri again in this outfit.\n\nIt's such a shame after the film is done there might be no more [Moe-chan](http://imgur.com/A7kiMy6.jpg). I think she'd make a great addition as a support with casual appearances in the show.\n\nYoung Shiori was adorable as frack. Even though this old character [Miyo Yasuda](http://imgur.com/lCuxIuY.jpg) will be remembered only in this episode I think her short appearance and performance was quite on point. She portrayed a very endearing grandma anyone can relate to. The way she tells a classic like LRRH with such love makes you understand even better the pain Shiori goes thru in these two episodes. Wich also got to me almost in a personal matter when Yoshino told Shiori that it was just a house and people must move on. In a bitter vindictive way I liked Shiori's retort in wich Yoshino has no right to talk about letting the past go and move on when she herslef abandonded her hometown. I'm glad Yoshino apologized for that later.\n\n[Dang precocious kids](http://imgur.com/ycOuCll.jpg), they can spot one of the [best attributes](http://imgur.com/uV8j0Aj.jpg) from the Goddess Sanae. [Riri sneaking](http://imgur.com/vH5kBf6.jpg) away with her butt against the wall made me think she was afraid of getting the same treatment, although we learn later she's just bad with kids (I can totally relate to that).\n\nHah hah. [Kadota](http://imgur.com/03kgIG5.jpg) is still the [laughing stock](http://imgur.com/LafMIV1.jpg) in this show.\n\nI like all these small flashbacks of our main cast to their childhood. The Maki footage playing a tree in Snow White and also Shiori's story telling, I hope somehow they could connect with the day Yoshino visited the Chupakabura palace and became the 10000 visitor.\n\nMaki had to kill it in her own story arc. [Her](https://streamable.com/kippe) [montage](http://imgur.com/frtpxwO.jpg) was [pristine](http://imgur.com/Ig518CW.jpg). The music was so freaking gorgeous and nostalgic. I felt a bit discouraged because Maki didn't pick a card, until I realized it was all for the better and let her chose her own path rather than relying on mere luck. \n\nThat was probably the [best hug](http://imgur.com/n5YG2up.jpg) of [the season](http://imgur.com/rpZmqXK.jpg) without being melodramatic. Although I felt Shiori really needed a hug more than anyone in this episode, but I guess Pink Miyamori's effort of making Yasuda san name into the movie was a good replacement for that missing hug.\n\nThe [girls having a slumber party](http://imgur.com/3fpxuCb.jpg) brings up such fond memories of Miyamori and her crew [wolfing down the donuts](http://imgur.com/1UWZU45.jpg). Forgot who it was that said Sanae [without glasses](http://imgur.com/O95LVVR.jpg) is also [a cutie](http://imgur.com/dBkBlSm.jpg). I actually like her better with glasses and a bit of make up to make her look more mature, it's so easy to mix her age without those especially along the other younger girls in the cabinet.\n\nPinkamori now refers to herself as the [Queen of the Kigdom of Chupacabra](http://imgur.com/AgCqVKb.jpg). That last joke was genius, reminded me of the Simpsons filming the Radioactive man allowing the hollywood producers to [destroy a whole nuclear plant](http://imgur.com/dFVtOVl.jpg) pavillion.\n\nYoshi is Mewmori's lost twin when it comes to [facial expressions](http://imgur.com/CodKFDN.jpg)\n\nOh boy, and here I thought there would be no new outfits today. And the preview shows even more new outfits next episode.\n\n[](#woo)\n\n\nEdit: added 2 outfits that went off my radar. Shiori wearing an apron on top of her Pink sweater getup. And Maki dressed up as Moe-chan.\n\n\n#EPISODE 7 OUTFIT COUNT\n___________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Riri's outfits: 2**\n\n[Beige shirt with tanktop on top & long black skirt](http://imgur.com/Scz4odC.jpg)\n\n[Red puzzle shirt pajama](http://imgur.com/7VZjJxv.jpg)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Yoshino's outfits: 1**\n\n[Lavender white stripped hoddie & shorts](http://imgur.com/1kXIKhl.jpg)\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Shori's outfits: 1**\n\n[Complete pink pajama with ruffles](http://imgur.com/S0prwpC.jpg)\n\n**Number of Shori's variations: 1**\n\n[Pink sweater/Polka dot shirt & orange skirt+apron](http://imgur.com/AeGuF4W.jpg)\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Number of Maki's variations: 1**\n\n[Roll out of bed combo+Purple hoodie](http://imgur.com/qT05JHT.jpg)\n\n**Number of Maki's outfit: 1**\n\n[Moe's getup: Rufled shirt with Babydoll top & capri pants](http://imgur.com/oqqiNuP.jpg)\n\n___________________________________________________________\n#[WARDROBE SUMMARY](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/66b42x/spoilers_sakura_quest_episode_3_discussion/dgh1qya/)\n_________________________________________________\n**TOTAL OUTFIT COUNT SO FAR**\n\n**Yoshino** outfits: 7\n\nYoshino variations: 5\n\n**Shiori** outfits: 6\n\nShiori variations: 1\n\n**Sanae** outfits: 6\n\nSanae variations: 0\n\n**Maki** outfits: 6\n\nMaki variations: 1\n\n**Riri** outfits: 5\n\nRiri variations: 0\n\n\n______________________________________________\n\n"

Even if it's a small role, Maki-chan gets to re-live her love for acting. And speaking of tiny concessions, Yoshino also finds a way to honour Shiori's memories of that old lady.

She wasn't just doing it for Shiori's sake, but more because what Shiori said really meant something for her."

(Riri protecting her own butt as she quietly makes her escape from the brat-zombies was also cute. lol )\n\n- Everyone's being a \"bro\" (or is it \"sis\"/\"she-bro\" for girls?) to everyone in this episode:\n\n1. Maki giving Riri, who had to stand in due to Maki turning down the role, some much needed acting advice. After spending time together, Maki seems to understand Riri's personality already, and knew Riri's confidence would take a huge dent if she were to be replaced by someone else.\n\n2. After hearing Shiori's sentimental feelings for the house to be burned down, ~~Pink Miyamori~~ Yoshino tactfully requested the filmmakers to include a tribute in the credits to the late old lady that used to live there as a sign of respect and remembrance.\n\n3. Maki's own brother and tsundere dad pulling strings to ensure the brat-zombie extras are available\n\n4. Riri. Indirectly helping Maki remember what made her fall in love with acting. (My yuri goggles is sensing a yuri-ship in the making here)\n\n4. Maki again. Offering to be Moe's stunt double. A win-win situation for Maki as well as she once again reaffirms her love for acting.\n\n5. Yoshino for just being Yoshino, allowing Maki to redeem herself. (OK, I'm stretching things here)\n\n- [Drunk Shiori with her hair down](https://i.imgur.com/H5BUGP7.png) is hawt <3"
