Classic JRPG, standard party loadout - Hero, Warrior, Mage, Cleric. Being, like, 6 years old, I never really got the hang of actually *progressing* in the game past a certain point (a quest puzzle got me stuck), so I ended up just grinding and having fun. And through it all, that Warrior a goddamn badass, thanks to great RNG for stats and gear. Combat was pretty much \"Wait until he can use his multi-attack to just one-shot everything.\"\n\nThat warrior's name? ~~Albert Einstein~~ Thor. Randomly generated name.\n\nI thought it was pretty cool, so I tried to use it as my Runescape handle a few years later. Taken, obviously, so I picked \"gold\" at random, and \"thorgold\" was born. Later on, I lost the password to my fledgling youtube account for \"thorgold,\" didn't bother with recovery, so I just stuck Xs on the end. \"xthorgoldx.\" I'm rather fond of it nowadays."

Think about the tertiary and quaternary structures of proteins, and what happens to those proteins when they are mis-folded or denatured.\n\n For a more powerful and subtle indication of the link between form and function in nature look at the proteins that are known as Ras GTPases. In general these proteins are usually inactive when bound to a GDP molecule because two of their active domains are obscured from interacting with the outside world. However, when bound to GTP, these \"switch regions\" are then folded differently such that they are able to interact with their environment. Once its structure has been altered, these proteins then proceed to regulate the cytoskeleton and vesicle trafficking of the cell, where as before they were completely unable to do that function."

By entering into the third dimension, the paper gained energy from a force that was acting only in the third dimension: gravity.\n\nIf we take this example a bit further, we could say that hypothetically the fourth dimension has some sort of force similar to gravity, except it doesn't act in only one direction. Maybe it's a force that is constantly shifting, allowing one to utilize that force to convert mechanical energy (or some alternative) into electrical energy, then pass it back to the third dimension. Currently, there is a theory stating that gravity is a force that actually stems from an alternate dimension, and it has \"leaked\" into ours. Whose to say there isn't all sorts of crazy shit going on with that?\n\nNow of course this show is fictional, so the most likely scenario is the Wam are literally just a plot device.

It is because a child does not fully comprehend the concept of \"killing\" someone, and isn't developed enough to understand whether their behavior is wrong. When someone pulls the trigger, they are fully aware of the consequence of that action.    \nIn the same way, \"humans\", in our case, are fully aware of what a Wam *is* and what it *can* be used for; with an understanding of what it means to kill someone/destroy something. So, the responsibility of their actions lies solely with them.\n\n***\n\n> Every child with a piece of paper now has more power than a nuclear armed country.\n\nNot really. A Wam only supplies the \"requested\" amount of energy to the circuit it's connected. You are assuming that every child knows how to build a nuclear warhead and can somehow get their hands on all the necessary materials required to make one. And in that the case, I don't think Wams would be your primary problem.\n\n***\n\n> Also he's clearly intentional fucking with people.\n\nThat, I can't argue with.

There's all sorts of ways you can scale normal equipment to world-ending devices with infinite energy and some creativity.~~\n\nNvm, you are correct. Turns out it is incredibly difficult to just arbitrarily scale up existing devices to make use of infinite power.\n\nI'd be surprised if it'd even be useful to state actors for the production of weapons of mass destruction. Infinite power means infinite waste heat, and the need for materials that can actual handle that much power.\n\nAs far as I can tell infinite power doesn't let your do anything that you couldn't do now. It just lets you reduce the price of power to zero.\n\nEven the global warming issue brought up on the show is a non-issue as it'd require as 100'000 fold increase in per capita power usage before we near throwing Earth's thermodynamic balance. We've only increased per capita 100 fold in all human history, I can see that happening more than twice over to the point that people are using a city of energy each. \n\nThe only harm will be the short term damage of various energy and energy-dependent markets collapsing.\n\nOur ability to handle market collapse is on us. Norway's economy is rooted in oil wealth but I see them surviving the collapse of the oil markets, where as we've seen plenty of oil-based economies keel over in response to much smaller fluctuation in oil price.\n\nNorway would be a much better setting for Kado. It's economy would take a much harder hit from the WAMs, and it's actually the most generous country by many standards unlike Japan.\n\n>We know nothing about it, so we can't say whether he's a saint or the devil.\n\nHe explicitly states that he's supplied humanity with abundance, when he's actually created scarcity. He talks about infinite bread, when really there's just 200 infinite bread makers. That's a huge difference, he was pretending didn't exist. It's not like it's even possible to hook up 200 WAMs to the electric grid to ensure that infinite power could get to everyone. Sure there's the Georgist model that everyone could get some benefit from the WAMs, but the notion that all humanity could get access to infinite power through the WAMs was a boldface lie, up until the paper WAMs were revealed."

And walking down that path without annihilating ourselves is our responsibility.\n\nAs for \"managing\" that infinite energy. The old scientist already stated that Wams only supply the \"requested\" amount of energy to a circuit. It's not that an infinite amount of energy will start pouring out of it once you connect it to something, only the requested amount comes out. So, whatever circuits (i.e., devices) we use, to \"utilize\" that wam, is up to us. Attach it to a particle accelerator, and you can mash subatomic particles all day. Attach it to the power grid, and yay! free electricity 24x7 no matter the load.\n\nIt's up to us to figure out the infinite possibilities of using those wams."

Also, Shinawa with the Wams should be a comment face ASAP!  \nTo the episode itself:  \nI kind of expected that something would escalate by the end of the episode but I haven't really expected that they'd just show off how to make a Wam...of mere sheets of paper no less! I feel like it will accelerate the plot progression since there aren't many brakes I can think they could put in to stop further escalation.  \nThe thing I find pretty fascinating is actually the Prime Minister as a character. He seems really idealistic in terms of how to live together as humanity and it looks like he really is a good guy when you listen to how he argues - however, he really seems to play with fire by causing a \"revolution\".  \nIt also felt to me that he's in the \"Well, I'll side with you and in case we get attacked, I got your support at least\" stance or that he's got less noble goals when we think about the question WHO should pave the way to worldwide unity and prosperity. The way the show keeps up the moral ambiguity of the characters and their actions is a really great aspect. It'd be boring to know that the Prime Minister/zaShunina/UN has evil intentions/is evil that must be defeated - instead, it keeps the human reactions relatable and zaShunina a big mystery as to his goals and desired role in the world.\nIt'll be interesting to see how the series progresses and the other characters will handle this whole situation."

She's not \"out of place\" at all: on the contrary, she has a very well-defined (and *necessary*) place within the story.

   "text": "> Anyone experienced in sociology/economics enough to know whether this actually makes sense and who can explain the terms?\n\nThis is actually physics. Spinodal decomposition is the name of the process where a mixture achieves thermodynamic equilibrium by separating out into its constituent components. Think of a heated and agitated mixture of water and oil being let to sit and cool - the mixture will rapidly revert to a mass of oil + a mass of water. That's spinodal decomposition. \n\nNow, when he says \"temperature\" and \"density\", I don't think he's referring to literal air temperature or anything like that - it's probably the temperature and density of some inexplicable anisotropic thing like \"Unocle\". \n\nPutting it all together, what he's saying is a bit muddled. I think the intent was to convey the following idea: in an ideal world, bread would be distributed evenly between country A and country B. However, in actuality, the world is in a state of disequlibrium: country A has all the bread, and country B has none. We would expect \"spinodal decomposition\" to occur, thereby bringing the world back to an equilibrium state where the bread is evenly distributed. However, this process is inhibited (\"in stagnation\") due to the actions of the countries involved. \n\nWhat it actually sounds like he's saying, though, is that 1.) equilibrium is the state where country A has all the bread and country B has none; 2.) we expect \"spinodal decomposition\" to occur to bring the world into a state where both countries share the bread equally; 3.) this \"spinodal decomposition\" is impeded. However, (1) is weird, because it doesn't make narrative sense for uneven bread distribution to be the \"equilibrium state\"; and (2) doesn't really make sense, because spinodal decomposition is, by definition, a process by means of which a system _achieves_ equilibrium, not disequilibrium."

But the question is, how does \"infinite electricity\" translate into the real world? Let's say everyone learned the secret origami technique and created a Wam for themselves. Now, if you're dead broke and on the verge of starvation, how will a Wam help you? What are you going to do, exchange some of the electricity for food? I guess zaShunina's definition of \"advancing\" humanity doesn't include \"saving\" it.\n\nStill, now that the Great Origami Sorceress has shown everyone how to make a Wam. How will things proceed from here? Collapsing economies everywhere? Riots? Wam terrorism? \n\nzaShunina has hinted many times that the idea of \"countries\" is a big hurdle in the \"advancement\" of humanity. So, I'm guessing that eventually, everyone is going to come to their senses and decide to form some sort of global nation and unite under one banner (It's no going to be easy).

And that's what I mean by \"how does it translate into the real world\".\n\nEnergy is just one rather small part of advancing technology. Much of it depends on how \"smart\" we are as a human race and how efficiently we can utilize the limited resources we have. Even with the miraculous Wams, scientific breakthroughs will still require scholars with brilliant minds and an education system which isn't a \"business\" like we have today, and actually nurtures the scientific way of thinking.\n\nFor example, who is to say that the scientists wouldn't be forced to produce \"weapons\"? Or those breakthroughs won't be misused?   \n \nSo, another aspect of that would be our values of \"morality\". Because our whole society, and even the way we think, our psychology, is highly influenced by the limited amount of resources we've had since the beginning. It is a big reason why we have greed, corruption, wars etc. \n\nIt is like the case of \"monkey with a knife\".

   "text": "> With infinite energy now scientist need to discover a way to transform it in more useful matter like water, food, etc.\n\nThe thing about converting energy into matter is that it is nearly impossible to produce matter in mass quantities at once. The only instance of energy being converted into matter on a massive scale was when the Big Bang happened (even the massive supernovas can only \"fuse\" matter into heavier elements). Today, we **can** convert energy into matter in particle accelerators in a process called [pair production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production), where    \n> the photon is literally split into an electron and its anti-particle, called a positron\n\nFurthermore,\n\n> to produce ordinary baryonic matter out of a photon gas, this gas must not only have a very high photon density, but also be very hot \u2013 the energy (temperature) of photons must obviously exceed the rest mass energy of the given matter particle pair. The threshold temperature for production of electrons is about 10^10 K, 10^13 K for protons and neutrons, etc. According to the Big Bang theory, in the early universe, photons and fermions (massive particles of matter) would inter-convert freely. As photon gas expanded and cooled, some fermions would be left over (in extremely small amounts ~10\u221210) because low energy photons could no longer break them apart. Those left-over fermions would have become the matter we see today in the universe around us.\n\nLook at it this way, according to E=mc^2 , 1gm of matter is equivalent to roughly 9x10^13 Joules of energy. How much energy is that? A fuckton. The nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima (Little Boy) exploded with an energy of about 6.3x10^13 Joules. So you'll need *that* much energy in a spot to produce 1 gm of matter (of course its not as simple as accumulating energy into a spot and BAM you have matter).\n\nThe matter (and antimatter) that we produce today in particle accelerators is in the form of subatomic particles (with minuscule masses). And it would take a long long time to even produce 1 gram of that. To quote [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter),\n\n> The biggest limiting factor in the large-scale production of antimatter is the availability of antiprotons. Recent data released by CERN states that, when fully operational, their facilities are capable of producing ten million antiprotons per minute. Assuming a 100% conversion of antiprotons to antihydrogen, it would take 100 billion years to produce 1 gram or 1 mole of antihydrogen (approximately 6.02\u00d710^23 atoms of anti-hydrogen).\n\nAnd since matter and antimatter, both are produced in pair production, the same can be said for producing mass quantities of matter. Of course with technological advances, we will be able to shorten this time period and increase the amount produced, but the sheer massive amount of energy involved is very hard to handle.\n\nI think it might require more than a 1000 years for us to get to that point. So, things that can't be directly produced using electricity/energy, will become limiting factors in the advancement of mankind. Unless the next thing zaShunina teaches us is how to replicate matter (like the food items he did inside Kado)."

It's not about \"how much\" energy we need. Consider this, stack two micro SD cards on top. That's the amount of space 1 gram of matter occupies (roughly, it changes depending on the density).\n\nAnd to produce that much matter, you need that \"fuckton\" of energy (worth more than a nuclear bomb) in that small small space.  To quote the article I linked, \"The threshold temperature for production of electrons is about 10^10 K\". You know what will happen at that temperature, your whole apparatus will melt and be converted into plasma. And the matter and antimatter pair that you have produced will mutually annihilate each other releasing that fuckton amount of energy.\n\nThe reason we can only produce matter (and antimatter) in our particle accelerators and not have it melt is because we produce it at a subatomic level (which is a lot easier to control). To \"mass produce\" matter, infinite energy isn't that much of a concern than accidentally triggering an explosion that will wipe out everything in a few mile radius.\n\nIt's not so much an obstacle of \"resources\", it is a literal physical obstacle in that the physics is telling us that we can't."

Those who can afford to utilize said thing will be the ones to benefit from it the most, while others will be at a disadvantage and try to demand access or even fight for it. That was my takeaway from the UN meeting, given that the most powerful countries with significant influence are the ones acting as the heads in the organization.\n\nNow, since it was revealed that Wam can be made and become accessible to everyone, there is no longer a reasonable or logical way to capitalize Wam; it is \"infinite energy\" for all. Even if groups try to capitalize it (make and sell to other people), there would be risks in failing to profit off something that just about anyone can make for themselves.

It will take a good while before Wam is weaponized to the extent of being more dangerous than nuclear weapons. For starters, though, Wam could be used to irradiate normal isotopes to create radioactive ones, thus becoming a supply of infinite fuel for nukes. With a _lot_ more intensive research, an antimatter-based bomb might be possible with infinite energy. For close-range, I can see devastating rail-guns or lasers being developed.\n\n..Yeah, I think we'll only me limited by our imaginations at that point. Dangerous."

Good luck building an infinitely large ICBM to deliver it. You can create an infinite amount of antimatter for a bomb? Good luck creating an infinitely large magnetic containment field for it. You can put an infinitely large amount of energy into a bullet for a railgun? Good luck building an infinitely large railgun that can actually put that energy to good use. You can charge lasers with infinite energy? Good luck building an infinitely large laser cannon to use that energy."

   "text": "> Immediate solution is to just give the wams out to various countries. All the 100+ largest countries in the world get one, with groups of smaller countries having to form international organizations to oversee their use.\n\nImplausible. Giving 1 wam to each country isn't giving the wam to humanity, and it just compounds the problem. What happens if the government monopolises their nation's wam for themselves, etc?\n\n> Or they could just blow up their lab and say that the wams blew up in an accident. (They'd then be able to keep the wams for themselves, and everyone else wouldn't want to risk similar accidents.)\n\nI'm pretty sure they were stated to be indestructible, and I doubt the UN would believe it anyway.\n\n> Get around the UN wanting the wam, by giving one to the US. Since they're all infinite power sources, having 1 is like having 100 of them, and the US wouldn't want to have Russia and China getting them, so it'll then veto any resolution to have the UN get the other wams.\n\nBut the USA is only 1 member of the security council. If they tried to overturn the UN's demands, they'd be attacked as well as Japan. Besides, again, giving them a single Wam is not what ZaShunina wanted for the advancement of humanity.\n\n> You mean to tell me one guy 'thinks' really hard about the thing's shape and suddenly manages to figure out how it works, just like that? Without understanding any of its principles? Reverse engineering complex devices doesn't work that way.\n\nSuspension of Disbelief. She has a childlike potential, so she can think about things differently. besides, you're talking about something completely alien.\n\n> Folding paper should never be able to get you a wam.\n\nAnd giant cubes should never be able to appear in the sky and absorb planes.\n\n>If they thought wams could be turned into weapons, then it was very irresponsible to share the secret of how to make more.\n\nBut the same can be said of nearly every technological advancement. There will always be those who misappropriate new technology for evil purposes, but if you cower from those people, you cannot advance. \n"

It has nukes; no one is going to attack it (not enough to seriously hurt it at any rate).\n\n> Suspension of Disbelief.\n\nYea that's the problem, I don't.\n\n> And giant cubes should never be able to appear in the sky and absorb planes.\n\nYea but I can accept that it's made out of phlebotinum.

It'd be like the US thinking nukes are dangerous and then telling people how to turn mud into yellowcake. That's... stupid."
