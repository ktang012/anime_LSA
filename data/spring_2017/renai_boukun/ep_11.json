It's very derpy and goofy which I am a fan of and the overall presentation is really fun. I love the reaction faces, which I'm a big sucker for. I like how the series is basically a parody of itself and knows that its characters are funny because they're so ridiculous and tropey. It doesn't seem to take a lot of effort to be funny but just naturally is through presentation and the energy and ridiculousness of it all. The Yandere and Loli girl would be annoying if it wasn't for the way the shows presents them, sort of knowing that they're tropey gag parody characters. \n\nEverything in this show is stupid, but it's with the intention to be stupid. It makes what on paper sounds like a generic comedy work so well because of its self-awareness, and I hope it manages to keep that up throughout."

I don't think this has any baring on whether it's good or not as I've seen bad adaptations of great manga great adaptations of mediocre manga, but it has an influence. I'm sure plenty of people will enjoy this just like many enjoyed the second half of Demi Chan. As for me, this episode was a lot weaker... and I should stop rambling at 5 am "

The fucking timpani that plays when Akane runs seems really unnecessary.
