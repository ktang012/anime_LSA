   "text": "So I got bored and did some math on some anime physics.\n\n######Today's subject:  The Madan/Spirit Bullet that Nomura pulled on Rin\n\nA figure noted for the pound force of a one inch punch was [153 lbs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-inch_punch). This is **680.578 Newtons**. [For comparison, this is a little bit weaker than the average force behind a human bite, which clocks in at 720 Newtons.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\\(force\\)) Counting the distance as one inch, it has an energy of **17.3 Joules**, which is about [17x weaker than the energy behind a lethal dosage of x-rays, and 19x weaker than the energy needed to melt ice.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\\(energy\\))\n\nTo find the force needed to send someone flying like that, I fruitlessly searched [google](https://www.google.com/) until I remembered [a dash cam video of someone being sent flying by a car when trying to run through the street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwtfe7CHfTI), and decided that an average car going **30 mph** would be comparable to the hit she took. [A good weight for a larger car seems to be **1500kg**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\\(mass\\)). This means it would hit with a momentum of **20,116.8 kg*m/s**.\n\nThis momentum, being applied from Nomura's hand, is already astronomical. However, this isn't all - it being an approximate one-millimeter punch, its force is applied rapidly from a standstill. Its force can be calculated by assuming his fist, from start to contact, traveled for about **10 milliseconds**. This means the force applied amounts to... drumroll please:\n#**2,011,680 Newtons!**\n\n\nTo put this outrageous number into perspective - [The thrust of the main engine on the space shuttle at takeoff amounts to **1,800,000 Newtons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\\(force\\))\n\nTaking the 1mm assumed distance into account, the Madan had an energy of...\n#**2011.68 Joules!**\n\nThe energy output of the Madan falls somewhere nicely between [a single shot from an M16 \\(at 1800 Joules\\) and the energy needed to vaporize one gram of water into steam \\(at 2300 Joules\\).](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_\\(energy\\))\n\n#tl;dr don't fuck with spirit bullets\n\nSource: Anything I pulled for comparison came from wikipedia except for that one youtube video and sometimes google"

To more accurately explain the measurement I gave, since I left it a bit vague, the energy output of the Spirit Bullet is slightly higher than the kinetic energy of a 5.56x45mm 4.1g M16 bullet fired at 930 m/s. The Spirit Bullet is Nomura's hand (which we could calculate the size, mass, and speed of with our energy figure, if we really wanted) outputting about that same energy.\n\nThe impact would be similar to being hit while wearing body armor, since both the armor and the palm would serve to apply the energy over a wider area, and should be enough to break bones, given the right angle of attack"

The MC needs to defeat and collect all 5 of the \"Swords\" Stamp in order to walk outside freely when he so desire.\n3. and the last, crucial, noteworthy that is making us strongly believe that this anime resembles to Katanagatari is The Episode Tittle! \n\nIn episode 1, the tittle is called \"Subarashiki Yaiba [Onigawara.Rin]\" or in translation it is called \"The magnificent Blade [Demon Laughing.Rin]\" and in episode 3, the tittle is called \"Uruwashiki Yaiba [Kikakujou.Meari]\" Or in translation it is called \"The Fair Blade [Turtle Crane Castle.Mary]\"  Do You see what I see here? Its exactly what my nostalgia feels like! \n\nThis is the anime I am hook to watch till the end!\n\n(About the naming part on no.3, the first one I just butchered it and the second one, I google-translate that name.

   "text": "I know people who enjoy this garbage will downvote me, but whatever.\n\nThis is one of the worst written and directed shows I have seen for quite a while. Opening scene takes 6 minutes and majority of it is just spouting dry exposition. I get a feeling that it is supposed to be wacky dumb fun, but at the same time music is heavy and colors are toned down. The best part is that most of the things that were said in the first few minutes were pointless, stuff we could have seen.\n\nFor example how much better show would be if we just started from the point of view of main character. We start by seeing flashbacks of him fighting in the past and him saying he was sent to this school because of it. He enters school focused on himself wanting to just have a calm quiet school life, you can add a bit of attitude to him like throwing can into a trash bin from big distance and lazy posture. Suddenly he is surrounded by all those girls with weapons and main exposition dumb would be done by main girl with a more wicked feel to it. Make it feel crazy. Now MC runs away through a window. Mask girl makes a wicked smile and slowly leaves the room. No while MC is doing a commotion in the school you cut into other swordsman while playing their own music themes or better make MC run into those swordsmans. Each of them would have different reaction to him, some would show disinterest, other would be seemingly nice, teasing him, one could be seemingly angry at him\u2026 Make it varied and built threat. At last he runs into mask girl again and they fight. \n\nJust something consistent emotionally.\n\nAbout writing, like god damn it. I understand they want their feminazi school and femdom undertones, but at least make it make sense in the world. From our perspective it looks like your normal modern society. Giving girls weapons is not out of the question, fact that they start running the school also is not a problem. Problem is when they are aggressors. Whole premise of their rise to power is built on the idea that they defend themselves, but right now they are going around and force fights. MC did nothing that would warrant attacking him, they have no business \u201ccorrecting\u201d him because he did nothing to cross them. You might say that this is to show how power hungry they are, but then\u2026 show it, really show how wicked they are. Don\u2019t present them as just cute girls that need to defend themselves, commit. Not to mention that this was supposed to be modern setting, where are the parents. Adults gave those girls weapons, so when they clearly misuse it, it would be taken away.\nLast critical flaw of the setting is the fact that\u2026 swords? I have no issue with all characters having swords, but they are trying to kill each other. Blood was shed\u2026 This isn\u2019t case of quirky school, but just straight up murder and as I have said before this is normal modern setting from what we know. When those girls came at MC he could just refuse and what\u2026 they would slice him up? Beat him up to death? Who writes this garbage?! If they assaulted him then he could just go to police, show them sword cuts and say that those guys with weapons attacked him on the first day at school. WHY THERE IS EVEN A CONFLICT HERE?!\n\nThis show straight up contradicts itself in the first minutes. This isn\u2019t case of girls rising to power via aggression because they had to defend themselves, they were given permission to carry a weapon by adults who then suddenly disappear from story. Premise is built around girls defending themselves and going to far with it (like prison school), but MC never actually did anything\u2026. like at all. Shows tries to have typical modern anime school setting while throwing THREAT OF MURDER AND DEATH into the mix, like\u2026 what? Maybe if it was dystopian matriarch future where males are second class citizens and scale of the issue was global. \n\nThis show is garbage and I am saying this as a person who loves watching shows like Ange Vierge, Cross Ange, Symphogear, Rakudai etc. I have no idea how low your standards must be to enjoy this show\u2026 honestly.\n"

The battling is OK, but it's not even as clever as it pretends to be, it's more akin to chuuni bs than actual tactics. There's just a certain lack of zest to the presentation that makes it really dull, when it's supposed to have some edge to it. The burden of trying to be a low key school anime.\n\n[](#kumikouninterested)\n\nThis will be like a GabDrop to me. Where it will feel more and more tired each episode, and the action isn't as flashy or clever in any way. I'll be dropping this."
