Also the first Chinese anime I actually watch\n\n[Re:Creators](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34561/Re_Creators) Reverse Isekai, where fictional characters appear in our real world (similar to Fate?)\n\n[Renai Boukun](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32262/Renai_Boukun) Hilarious train wreck \n\n[Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32951/Rokudenashi_Majutsu_Koushi_to_Akashic_Records) interesting anime with a slightly less interesting premise. Seems promising though\n\n[Sakura Quest](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34494/Sakura_Quest) pretty much Shirobako, but at the moment I'm getting quite bored of it\n\n[Seikaisuru Kado](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32032/Seikaisuru_Kado) hard sci-fi anime involving a bit of politics (negotiation). Although the art is mainly CGI, I'm not put off by it and the plot is really interesting imo.\n\n[Tsuki ga Kirei](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34822/Tsuki_ga_Kirei) a really feel good romance anime that I really enjoy. Not too much unnecessary drama and story seems very realistic. The drama part might change though, after watching the latest episode :/ \n\n[Zero Kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34176/Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Mahou_no_Sho) I'm just watching it for the character interaction between the 2 mains. I love the characters and I haven't watched much anime involving beasthuman  "

She's not doing this for Sagiri's sake, she's doing it for her own selfish damn reason. I do hope there is a reason to her behavior but until that's revealed I just can't like her character.\n\nAlso how can an MC be straightforward with his feelings and dense at the same time? That opening was basically a confession but Izumi was obviously holding back and added a disclaimer of \"as a brother\" because in his head he thinks Sagiri is in love with someone else.

   "text": "Aight. I know this show's getting a lot of shit for what it is and all that. I don't even really want to delve into that right now. It's midnight and I decided to watch this episode, and I'm convinced now that this show is significantly more self aware than people want to give it credit for. \n\nReally, weekly, I've been watching this show at about midnight, right after the new episodes of AoT and BnHA. It's a weird way to finish the night. But, despite what anyone has to say about this show, good or bad, I have to admit that I'm finding it **entertaining**. That's what matters the most to me, I think. \n\nBack to what I was saying earlier, about it being self aware: I know people have already stated that this show is totally throwing stuff at you and hoping that it's meme-worthy or snapshot-worthy enough to spread online. I also think that's happening, and I think it's totally intentional and kinda smart. I think it's self aware beyond that, though.\n\nI don't remember that weird goofy flute soundtrack at all from any of the previous episodes. (Upon second thought, maybe it has shown up before. Either way, doesn't matter much.) It shows up here and plays when Sagiri is changing and when Masumune is ironically explaining how he wants his little-sister heroine to be just like Sagiri. It reminds me of the same stupid goofy off-key flute playing I hear in meme videos on Instagram every now and then; the kinda stuff that got real popular back when Vine was around. That flute is used in those kinds of videos when absurdly dumb things are happening. A lot of people who dislike this show have a main complaint of thinking that the incest-stuff going on is dumb. That could be precisely why the flute soundtrack is used there; those involved with the show aren't just saying 'haha look at this goofiness', they're saying 'this is goofy and also dumb.' I think.\n\nThis show is doing a lot of what a normal comedy anime would do, but I sincerely am starting to believe it's self-aware about the absurdity of its whole scenario. It's like... it's like Mayoiga, but slightly different, and way messier. \n\nIt's all for absurdity and nonsense, covered in some degree of coherence that appears and disappears and then reappears whenever, for whatever reason. Why else would the love confession at the start be expressed and then done away with so quickly? Why else did they include those random small clips of the dude running back and forth, and eventually falling over? That had no correlation to *anything* going on. How else do you explain the fact that Masumune typically acts so flustered or just reacts in general to the weird shit the females in his life say or do, but when Megumi calls up and says 'Hey, guess what? I'm in the bath!', he gives us that pristine perfect complete blank face? \n\nUh... I think I'm probably a tad crazy. I just spent a good 30 min. typing all that up. That all is probably super incoherent. I don't even know if I'll keep it up or not. I do think I'm onto something, though, seriously. This show is taking all of its absurdity and making fun of it. It knows..\n\n"

But the sexualization towards Sagiri since the last episode seems so... Wrong, not the thing itself, but the execution. It could have been used differently, she is an erotic illustrator after all, but I feel those moments have a considerable lack of inspiration.\n\nAnd it's a shame, because like I said, it is a quality show, you can cut those scenes, or make them entirely different, and it would be still as good, maybe even better.\n\nWith all that said, I still enjoy it quite a lot.

Really to answer this we have to go to the abstraction and pin down what exactly, if, anything is \"wrong\" with incest and reddit is not the place for deep discussion.

   "text": "Disclaimer (because I don't want people to think I'm a nutcase): Obviously this is just treating a show that's not meant to be taken a certain way, to a darker more realistic setting. These arguments, though interesting aren't a reflection on what I think of the show, because I understand that these things don't really need to be considered because the show is framed that way. Just like you're not meant to think of domestic abuse when the tsundere hits the MC. With that established:\n\n> How is every single child actor not running afoul of the child labor laws then?\n\nInteresting point. My first inclination was to argue \"it is\", and child actors do often end up pretty *weird*. However I looked it up and wikipedia defines child labour as \"Child labour refers to the employment of children in any work that deprives children of their childhood {criteria one}, interferes with their ability to attend regular school {criteria 2}, and that is mentally, physically, socially or morally dangerous and harmful {criteria 3}\"\n\nI'd say child actor definitely hits criteria 2 and I'd argue *can* hit criteria 1, but it doesn't hit criteria 3. However I'd say drawing erotic pictures for a living does hit criteria 3.\n\n> And she still seems to be doing all right.\n\nShe has no friends or peers, is extremely sexualised at a young age, is attracted to her 'brother', she's not gaining any other employable skills and is most likely lacking in all her educational needs, she suffers from a severe untreated psychological disorder that stops her leaving her house, she has behaviour management issue (literally stamping on the floor until someone makes her food).\n\nI mean I suppose it really depends on how you define \"all right\", She seems relatively wealthy and happy, but she severely lacks social skills and this could really hurt her in the future. What's she going to do if she falls out with her brother and has to leave the family home? What if her brother dies? In either case she's lost 100% of her contact with other people.\n\nYou pointed out yourself in your first comment how it's wrong for a year nine to want to go out with a year six, what if as he grows older this relationship becomes sexually exploitative? \n\nEdit:\n\n> running afoul of the child labor laws then\n\nThis was actually a really interestingly phrased question that made me think \"what *are* Japanese child labour laws and is *this* violating them?\"\n\n\"According to a couple of sources online Japan's law says \"The Constitution puts a ban on child labour (Art. 27 para.3). This is elaborated in the LSL. Children under 15 full years *must not be employed*, except for those working for motion picture production and theatrical performances (Art. 56). Children under age 18 may be employed outside of school hours in light labour that is not be dangerous or harmful. Underground work is also forbidden.  \"\n\nSo although your example of child actors is covered, MC sisters job as an illustrator isn't, so she actually is, by definition, breaking child labour laws. *It would seem*"
