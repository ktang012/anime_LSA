In the end, I have a feeling he will choose to go the course, which is probably the correct decision as far as the game's development goes. Unfortunately, I'm getting the feeling Utaha is nearing the end of her rope at trying to Aki's affections. You can only go after someone so long, especially if they can not or will not reciprocate. I'm starting to get the feeling if she can't get what she wants from Aki she may ditch him soon. Which is a shame, because for all we rag on him, Aki is not beholden into giving her what she wants. Clearly he enjoys her work and sees her as a friend. While her having unrequited feelings for him sucks, he is not obligated in any way to return them. She does deserve better though."

It helps humanizing the girls and benefits the story as a whole.  For example: Toradora, the Monogatari series, Oregairu etc are all pretty solid on this front.  \n\nI'm glad that with the past two episodes, Saekano is making a great effort to flush out the mutual respect and friendship among the girls, despite their supposed \"rivalry\"."

He sure knows how to write mature, relateable drama. \n\nThere was a running gag that when he first embarked on writing Saekano, his editor reminded him to target age group half his usual readership, to which he was shocked, \"writing for 9 year olds??\" (White Album 2 was an 18+ galgame xD). The editor then proceeded to chide him, surprised that he didn't know his core readership was largely composed of 30 year olds... thus earning a nickname \"30+ writer\".\n\nSaekano is still a light-hearted harem rom-com, but I think we will get more mature vibe from the new season."
