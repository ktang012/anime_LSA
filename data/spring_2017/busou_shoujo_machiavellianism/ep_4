Explain further if you're trying to make a point.\n&nbsp;\n\n> We're just so use to Nomura always succeeding or things going right that we fail to realize that things can indeed go wrong.\n&nbsp;\n\nThe stakes were always low and the slightly \"scarier\" fights created by visual tension(blood and the \"Oh I'm going to look like I died until the next episode/transition\" scenes) were not raising the stakes by any means. If anything they helped embracing the rule of cool element and made it more digestible considering that we have a nonsensical(and slightly fetishistic) setting.\n&nbsp;\n\nIf they really kill Satori and her sister that no one cares about because she had like 4 dialogue lines and no personality that was trying to be characterized by a mere flash back before her supposed death, It will only damage the tone of the rest of the show. It's a school battle harem with quirky archetypes and a slight degree of self awareness about it's protagonist, to create or rather force stakes in the last 4 episodes is a suicidal or rather desperate move that wasn't even called for since no one would watch this show for the non existent tension or the amazing copy pasted archetypes.

   "text": "I think your problem is actually how you're perceiving the show in general. If you take a look in this comment section, EVERYONE isn't as aghast about the sudden drop of everyrthing going right. By you labeling it as a \"quirky battle harem\" You fail to realize that objectively,  whilst it used elements of that typical nature, that isn't the centerfold of the plot at all. It not that this doesn't fit the show, rather, its because it simply doesn't fit what you're looking for.\n\nAs for the first part(Should've referenced that prior) The show from the BEGINNING was setting an underlying message that the Empress and Nomura's past is quite dark and chilling, combining with the presence of the Empress being on the school grounds Nomura is attending. It was eventually going to take a turn once the Empress finally showed up in the later episodes. She showed up, and guess what happened? It got gritty. The show was helping set up the tone as the previous episodes weren't all \"Hey! Nomura won again!\" but rather,\"Hey! Nomura won..but something worse is to come.\""

Problem is, they'll fight to the death to defend that perspective, regardless of how much is thrown in the face of it. They tend to be the \"if it doesn't fit what I think it should be, it's trash\" type of anime viewer, so if they start arguing again I'd highly recommend just letting it go. They won't. They're just going to keep throwing pseudo-intellectual points that supposedly are making the show \"worse and worse\" despite not being able to recognize basic thematic issues and more complicated development, but then respond that that's not true and the show never had shit like that to begin with to emphasis the point; their argument style is basically, \"everything's shit anyway, so why care\"."
