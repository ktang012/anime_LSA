Its only when she met with the twins and her power didn't work that she got an idea of self.\n\nAs for why they kept her in a cave, I imagine that is due to her power as well.

We even saw it change after she met the twins.\n\nSana saying that \"I was happy every day there\" seems to fit with my theory that [the facility aren't total shit heads](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/630bmf/spoilers_alice_to_zouroku_episode_1_discussion/dfqp1sk/) from last week.

But it's nice to see a bit more to Sana's backstory, apparently the Twins are the only people that actually cared for her before. I think the Twins are actually good guys but because of circumstances they need to work for that organization. Also was that Chiwa Saito narrating during Sana's flashback? I'm pretty sure that was her.\n\n Sanae's pretty good! Love to see more of her and Sana together doing stuff. It's a bit slower than last week but I still like it.

Few possible theories to be gleamed, but there aren't enough clues besides her (kinda dark) flashback to conclude anything. She seems close to Zouroku though. Also, the nonchalance towards supernatural powers is reminiscent of Flying Witch (same director). \n\nWonder what triggered Sana's teleportations and if they were really random. \n\nThere should be a confrontation next episode. Not sure what's gonna happen. In any case I wish they could just keep up with the SoL the whole time, but I don't think that's gonna happen. \n\n\n\n\n\n"

Or to put it more simply, less Alice, more Zouroku.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that there's still no reason for me to be attached to Sana in any way.
