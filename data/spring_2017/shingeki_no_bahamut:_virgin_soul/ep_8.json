Animation wise it was really good, specially that dance scene. CGI was pretty solid unless you are the ones that search for CGI just to say that it wasn't well done. \n\nWriting and characterization was great, Nina was really adorable, \"Chris\" was pretty good too, found Rocky standing there besides Rita with that pose hilarious.\n\nThe pacing is pretty solid in my opinion, and they even manage to put in moments of just characters doing normal things, like Nina plucking out the Goose feathers after she came back of getting the things she was asked for.\n\nThe set up for the next episode was also on point. I found it pretty creepy and worrysome, specially since Azazel will basically use Nina \"weakness\" to manipulate her so he can accomplish his goal. I hope it doesn't end in something like Nina now can't transform, I really want Azazel to go through the punishment of doing something like this to Nina, and this is one of the best ways I can see for his character to change from being just a hatred/wrath machine.\n\nEpisode 6 in and the quality is overall pretty great. I hope the show keeps this quality or gets even better for the entirety of this show, because until now they have done an outstanding job, specially, for me, in the writing department, character department, animation, CGI (which this episode topped the ones with had before) and ilumination, shading. Music still doesn't make it for me, but the one we had this episode was pretty good and I can totally see it only getting better."

I'm not seeing a lot of creepiness here - he was basically like \"I need you to be a dragon to defeat the king; you turn into a dragon when you're around hot guys; I'm hot; so this is what we're going to do.\" \n\nIs it a nice thing to use her like that? Of course not - but then he *is* a demon, people are quick to forget that he basically ruined Favaro's and Kaisar's lives pretty much because he was bored. It's not a nice thing or a good thing or a commendable thing, and obviously he's not giving a thought to what Nina herself thinks or wants. (I'm pretty sure he didn't even think about what it means for *him*, guy's so hilariously immature.) But also he's not being particularly manipulative about it. Overbearing, yes.\n\n> I hope it doesn't end in something like Nina now can't transform, I really want Azazel to go through the punishment of doing something like this to Nina, and this is one of the best ways I can see for his character to change from being just a hatred/wrath machine.\n\nI think it's pretty obvious what's going to happen... Nina can't transform anymore (at least not on \"command\"). Azazel's entire plan hinges on him being able to make her transform. So his plan will fail, his demon pals will hate him (provided they're not destroyed right away), and Azazel himself will be either killed or captured. Bonus point if Mugaro attempts to help him and Azazel finds out that Mugaro is an angel(ish creature). "

Yeah, it is overbearing too.\n\nI don't think though that because he's a demon he is natural prone to evil acts, I think it is more something related to his pride being punished pretty hard and him wanting to take vegeance. We still don't see it but if the story is pushing for the Demons to also live in peace with Humans and Angels then by story we should expect that Demons are as able to do good acts that they are right now shown to do evil acts. \n\nI do hope that he sees Mugaro trying to help him and seeing that he's some sort of Angel. That would put something pretty interesting in his characters to look forward for."

It's not a very nice plan, it hinges on Azazel having a certain effect on Nina that she can't control, and Azazel clearly doesn't care about whether she actually wants to do this or not. But I don't think that's particularly manipulative. \n\nAs for doing bad things, it's probably not in all demons' nature, but I think in Azazel's case it's pretty much *his* nature. From what we've seen so far, garden variety demons, the goblins, monsters, etc. used to just mind their own business and avoid interaction with humans unless the humans summoned them. Same with the dragons, like Nina's tribe. It was the high-ranking demons like Azazel, Beelzebub, etc. that messed with humans, and in Azazel's case he pretty much admitted that he was just doing it for fun. For what it's worth though, I don't think that was about him being actually evil, more like simply arrogant and lacking empathy. \n\nHe's mellowed out a *little* since then, and I think Mugaro's presence probably helped, but in exchange he's developed a gigantic chip on his shoulder re: his wounded pride. So... yeah, lots of character development in store for him still. Unless they just kill him off...\n"

It's certainly a bit strange for him to have such a large role, and I'm wondering if they're not building him up simply so his death would resonate better with viewers.\n\nAnd again, Azazel didn't mean having sex. The word he used means to hold/embrace. It's just also widely used as an euphemism for having sex, and of course that's how Nina understood it. The translator probably didn't get the pun. But hugging Nina is what Azazel did to turn her into a dragon the first time, and this sort of misunderstanding has been a staple of their interactions so far. \n\n(I can't really see the logic of him trying to have sex with her to turn her into a dragon, anyway... it would be super dangerous for him as well.)\n"

Which is actually a good thing going forward because with Azazel also blurring some moral lines it means this isn't such a good vs evil narrative. \n\nRita continues to be the best character, she's so much fun to watch babysit everyone. I'm starting to get a bit annoyed with Ninas inability to interact with anyone she finds attractive, although it's interesting she's not shown as blushing at all around Azazel at the end which might show that once she 'falls in love' her change in romantic focus means no one else can cause her powers to activate. \n\nThat would make for a very interesting set of events, if the only person who can activate her powers is the person she's been roped in to use them against. Also could mean Nina can be her usual self around people like Azazel. \n\nVery good episode though, as mentioned in the current top comment, the pacing here is great and doesn't feel like it's taking too long to get places or that it's rushing through events just to showcase more action. For a 2 cour show as well that is just dandy. "

I haven't watched anime is a *very* long time (been more into games, been busy, and there's just generally been nothing of interest to me in the recent years besides like OPM and such) but I really love Virgin Soul so far. I think it's really well done - the story, the characterizations, animations, and interactions.\n\nWhat I really like about this episode is the contrast and two sides you see of Azazel and Charioce. Azazel was pretty much a bastard during Genesis and his only redeeming quality was his loyalty to Lucifer. Yet here, we're introduced to him as this vigilante demon who's trying to free enslaved demons and punish humans who abuse them, which is presented as pretty noble and he had been elevated to an almost protagonist status. That, coupled with his genuine care (in a big brother sort of way) to Mugaro, makes him seem like an actual good guy, if not anti-hero. In contrast, while we know all the humans love Charioce, the way we're presented to him makes us think of him as more evil; we see his ruthless side first. He obstinately does what he believes is right and did lead humanity to prosperity but took down the two other races.\n\nYet here, we see the other side of the coin. We get another glance at Azazel's immature, prideful personality - the one we're more familiar with from season 1 - and how he does want to use Nina as a tool for his own goals (even if he has made that clear to the audience and her.) At the same time, we see more of Charioce's \"human\" side where he does help other people out, he's more down-to-earth than you expect, he does seem to genuinely like Nina because he probably doesn't have a lot of freedom as the King, probably feels some sense of loneliness, and he finally found someone he can be more relaxed with. And I feel like they're going to keep showing us more of their good and bad sides so things aren't as black and white with them since one of the themes of this anime is about conflicting ideals and how no one person or ideal is necessarily right/they're all fighting for their own beliefs.\n\nLike a lot of other people mentioned, Nina doesn't seem to get flustered around Azazel anymore (probably cause she *actually* fell in love) so that'll probably be a dent in his plans. Not that I really expect it to all go according to plan even if she could because it's too early to kill off one of the major characters here. But I am interested to see how Charioce will feel about Nina when he finds out she's a dragon because he doesn't know yet; I can see him either trying to eliminate her or use her cause despite his feelings, he seems like someone who does put his goals before emotions, even cruelly so. Mugaro is definitely going to be important later on. Over all, really enjoy this.\n\n~~**Also, where the fuck is Lucifer. I was really hoping he'll be more relevant this season and it feels wrong that he might just be dead given how powerful he was in the games.**~~"

I always loved all of the characters in this series but I was kinda disappointed in how Charioce was this generically evil villian, but the creators really added another dimension to him with this episode! I thought that Chris was actually his twin brother or something but it's actually Charioce. He seems like a really interesting character. You wouldn't expect a tyrannical ruler to go out around town disguised just to experience life as the normal everyday man. When he said that he never danced liked that since he was a child, I'm pretty sure he was telling the truth to Nina and that he genuinely enjoyed his time with her. They both don't know who each other really are so they are able to act without any pretense and can just be themselves. Now and I can't wait to see how they develop his relationship with Nina. I love all of the new characters and their designs in this second season which I thought was impossible considering how good the characters were in the first season. Studio Mappa is doing a great job in this regard and many others."

I been dropping more shows every season and now I normally watch one or two. Its such a relief to find a show that makes your heart get excited ever time an episode comes out.\n\nThis episode was fantastic and I rewatched three times because I loved it so much. The main problem of a lot of anime both past and present  is the lack of passion of love. You know the stuff you see on Mexican novelas. \nIt has passion and that drama that is done right. The soon to be complications in the future of the characters is the perfect un avoidble drama that have seen in a long time. That's the kind of drama that I crave. I don't want something to come easy I want that fight so it will be worth it in the end!\n\nI love the Vibes that Nina is putting out. They are so strong that it reaches across the screen and into my heart. I like her what seems to be one sided love that feels so real and it exactly what I go through when I'm around a guy I like(minus turning into a dragon).\n\nI really like the grey area of the characters in the show with our two new males.\nAzazel wants the demons back on top of the food chain and free the demons slaves. But he wants to use Nina.\n\nCharoice wants to put the humans on top of the pyramid. Why should the humans be on the bottom? However he goes a little too far in slaving them at the cost of his humanity and it's ovious that he doubts himself. His character is the biggest mystery in this show. We don't know his full back story, what drove him to do this, and even how powerful he is. Heck we have even seen him really fight!!   \n\n\n\n"

Can't look weak or give up humanity's stranglehold on power lest the tables turn and they become victims again.  \n\nWhen he doesn't want to be on the clock, he wraps up the turban and it's shades up for a stroll through the city as Chris.  Protecting a girl from thugs isn't something Char would ever be able to do as The Prez.  But obviously he recognizes wrong and right in terms of making the Demons his victims (like Nina was) just can't really act on it (Kaiser can act and speak freely on it due to hero status, though).\n\nWhat a complex character."

One to prevent this Powers (he thinks its an Angel - Human Hybrid) and the other to use her Powers (he want her Dragon Powers, stronger then the Soldiers Magic). Jean the Arc, can be the trigger to open the Kings eyes, that he have the wrong child...or she play along. Do she recognizes her child, or do the Child recognizes his Mother? He could use Jean like a bait (open execution or With burn), to Lure this Holy Child in a trap to capture or dead. (If i can not have/control this Holy Child, then no other should be able, too)\n\nAlso, the power of the real Holy Child can just nullified the Human magic Bracelets, and perhaps even slow or stop Time. If you stop Time, beat 1000 Punches in a victims Chest, and then let Time flow again.. what will happen?\n\nNo the real \"Jackpot\" is this Holy Child, that did not show her real powers so far. Even to Azarel. Nina is the 3rd Strong Power of Dragons, the fear of Bahamut is living with her (and in the past, Demos, Angels and Humans work together to seal him). If Nina lose her \"humanity\" then her destiny is already written in stone, or old Arc Dragon Bahamut reapers with under the Control of this Girl (She did enter his mind no?)\n\nHoly Child is the \"Hope\" that these Dark Times (for Angels and perhaps for Demons/Devils and Human believer in God) are about to end\n\n\n\n\n"

   "text": "It has this level of budget because Cygames is one of the biggest mobile companies in japan.\n\nTheir animes are not even made to be ads to attract more people, they're just made as fanservice for the millions of players of their games.\n\nExample, the new airing anime GranBlue fantasy wich is also an adaptation of other game of Cygames, almost no one comments in that weekly post when a new episode comes out, and A1 pictures said that they're using a fucking lot of budget in that anime because animating that specific art style is a pain in the ass but they have no worries in doing it since Cygames keeps giving them money.\n\nAlso, their most recent game Shadowverse has been gaining a lot of popularity lately, and Cygames send a survey to the players of that game like 2 months ago asking if they would like an anime about the game. We're dealing with that type of company here."

   "text": "This season of Bahamut and the past season from 2014 are things that are not from the Rage of Bahamut game, the lore of the anime is original of MAPPA studios.\n\nIn fact, the only thing in common between the 2 things are the characters, the game has a completely different story.\n\nStill, this is overrall more decent that 90% of fantasy stories we have been having the last 5 years.\n\nEdit. Have you seen the first season, right?"
