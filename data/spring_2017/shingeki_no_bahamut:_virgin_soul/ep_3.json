He didn't do anything personality to Nina to make her truly hate him.If anything I think it would be more noble to see Nina change the king instead of out right hateing and oppsoing him. Love is wierd and crazy but I rather see Nina keep her love strong and help change someone because unlike most stories where to protagonists tries to change the antagonist perspective this series would be more appropriate for that. We have 13 more episodes so hopefully it can go in a good route"

His tone of voice even changed when he was talking to Nina and it didn't sound mocking at all. What was throwing me off in this scene was the music playing because it made everything thing feel positive and romantic. I think that is what the editor was trying to convey that this wasn't a mocking dialoge. If they wanted to show a more sinister tone they would have changed the music to emphasize the situation. Music has a huge part in contributing in what we should feel in a scene just go watch any video on YouTube talking about the importance of music in a film."

She's also pure of heart, so she takes it personally that he's bullying and enslaving the demons. So, for her its personal, especially after she fancied herself \"in love\".\nThe problem is that Charioce has really crossed the line by the point. Especially as we know from the PV that he is going to go even further in his thirst for power. We know by the end the three races are going to eventually get along in some kind of truce, but I can't see Charioce being by the majority of our heroes or their peoples. I can see him eventually getting redemption through a last sacrifice, but that's about it at this point.\nTo me, the fact that he was so light hearted in such a serious situation, especially after having bullied and threatened Jeanne and knowing what the reveal was doing to Nina, he was definitely mocking. There were a lot of other things he could have said that would be better suited to the situation."

   "text": "I AM. SINCE EP1.\n\nHere are my reasons:\n\n1. The Gods are lazy as fuck and comes off as giving no fucks about humanity unless they pray to them. Remember Season 1? Yeah. Way to neglect Jeanne when she was in trouble and let her get corrupted. The only God to have realized they fucked up was Michael. And that was too late by then and he died. Also judging from this episode, Gabriel proves to be no different than humans who would use children as weapons for their own ends. Like how a terrorist would make a child fight in a pointless war. And considering they don't really care much for humanity as shown so far in the series, I simply can't root for them.\n\n2. Demons have been toying with humans' lives since time immemorial. Azazel is guilty of this. Even the demon chick that got squashed is guilty of this. Yes he does seem sympathetic to his cause with killing off slave traders and saving innocent demon lives, but I fully cannot root for them. Why? Here's why. In his Shadowverse lore and lines in that game, he views humans as nothing more than inferiors. Which explains why he treats humans like crap and play with them like ants on an hill. Remember that whole thing with Favaro's and Kaisar's dad? Yeah...\n\nIn my reckoning, Azazel is just butthurt that humans can now fuck over the demon race and it rids him of his fun to toy with them. That and his wounded pride that the race he once called inferiors can actually bite back thanks to Charioce.\n\nBut wait? What about Belphegor? She was so hot! She is waifu and doesn't deserve to be squashed like a bug! Yeah... NO.\n\nIn her lore, she is a demon that tricks humans by giving them gold only to screw them over and it is heavily implied that she consumes their souls. So despite her small role in the series, she is no different than Azazel himself. ~~INB4 someone says they don't mind having their soul consumed because they are thirsty as fuck for pussy, legs, tits and ass.~~ If you ask me she got what was coming to her after god knows how many years of playing with humans' lives.\n\nAlso keep in mind that Shadowverse is a game made by Cygames, who also created Rage of Bahamut the mobile game, which this series is based off on, so my points about demons are valid since the claims came from an official source.\n\nNow you may wondering whoever was bothered to read this post before down-voting it:\n\n\"But Charioce is an asshole! WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU ROOTING FOR A GIANT DOUCHE LIKE HIM?! He ruined Jeanne's and El's lives! They just wanted to live in peace! GTFO I AM DOWNVOTING YOUR ASS!\"\n\nKeep in mind this. Charioce is a king that simply wants to place humanity on top in a fantasy world where they are inferiors to other magical races. What is wrong with that? Nothing. But it is an unreachable dream that cannot be made without any sacrifices. I do agree with Kaisar's ideology, but it is simply naive as Charioce points it. That and would you really expect a race that treats humans like inferiors have them stand as equals? OF COURSE NOT. Demons like Azazel would just LOL at humanity's faces and continue what he has been doing before Charicoe and his army went to hell. What about Gods? They will simply say no. Just like how they rejected Charioce's request for power to protect humanity. Heck the gods probably wouldn't even be fighting humans if they just given it to him! Some allies they are! Point is, humans are just getting caught in the middle in the war between gods and demons and unlike the other king who was a mama's boy who did NOTHING to change humans' position, Chris actually DOES SOMETHING. So you cannot simply write off Charioce being a bad person and put it at that. So his actions are JUSTIFIED. I would even add that Charioce is doing arguably the wrong thing for the right reasons, while someone like Azazel is doing the right thing for wrong reasons.\n\nNow what about Jeanne and El? Yes, it is a shame that El is taken into it and is now being used by the gods as a weapon. But consider this. After achieving so much for his kingdom in a matter of years, Charioce finds a threat that will put all his hard work to the gutter and making humans be the bitches of both gods and demons. So as a leader in charge of humanity's future and faced with a problem what does he do? GET RID OF THE PROBLEM LIKE A NORMAL PERSON WOULD WHEN FACED WITH A DILEMMA.\n\nHe could have had them arrested instead, but Jeanne was a saint, there was no way she was just going to yield to a king who attacked the holy temples. Also Charioce attacking Cocytus (the equivalent of hell in this series) and the holy temples, is tantamount to waging war against them. So in a war-like situation there is bound to be collateral damage and El was just unfortunate to be one, like the other innocent demons that got captured by humans, had he not unlocked his special abilities to deactivate the magically enhanced armor. \n\nAnd there was just no way Charioce could have just told his Onyx Guards this:\n\n\"If that angel with the big tits hides and is using a human household as a shelter, please be nice to the humans, but make sure you capture the angel!\". Yeah because people who are still worshiping gods would just comply with such a request! /s \n\nWith that said, Charioce cannot fully control people and have them be nice to others, otherwise, he can't accomplish anything by being nice. So he has to be an asshole if need be. \n\nI simply cannot understand how people would give praise to other characters such as Lelouch who does cross the line to achieve his ends, while Charioce well just gets treated like a villain and leave it at that. They both do evil things for a good cause. Though granted there are a few people who are curious about his backstory. Shame not a lot of discussion about these topics, since it's mostly just about waifus and feels from what I have seen thus far. Because from what is shown so far, in this series, as per the lyrics of the first opening: the world is black and white but the world is so gray. What more describe the situation between the three races?\n\nTLDR; Charioce is sexiest villain of all time and he is not really evil. He does arguably wrong things for the right reasons, compared to Azazel who does the right things for the wrong reasons, minus the fact that he was willing to put innocent lives in danger like he did with attempting to use Nina an innocent bystander as a weapon. Also the gods should have just given Charioce power if they really are allies and understand that the king simply doesn't want people to be collateral damage as a result of the feud between gods and demons. Simply surviving at the mercy of gods and demons isn't fair, so Charioce is motivated by good reason. At least what is shown thus far."

   "text": "I don't know why you responded to me with a quote that refers to me using Shadowverse as a source of my claims, with a claim that seems to be replying to my claim that Belphegor tricks humans. But regardless I will address the thing with Shadowverse and my claim about Belphegor not exactly aiding humanity. \n\nShadowverse is a game created by Cygames. Shadowverse uses cards from the Rage of Bahamut mobile game. Rage of Bahamut was also created by Cygames. What else could it be but an official source?\n\nNow for the Belphegor part.\n\n[Here](https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/card/belphegor) is her Shadowverse lore. Feel free to read it but I will also put in a shortened version of the lore from Shadowverse:\n\nBelphegor doesn't care about gold, so she gives it to humans in exchange for something (their soul). Judging from the text, it seems that Belphegor is TRICKING humans by luring them with gold without any prior knowledge of what's at stake.\n\nNow since you mentioned RoB lore, I searched up her lore in RoB and here is what I found from this [website](http://wiki.rageofbahamut.com/Belphegor). Below are what I picked up from reading her RoB lore.\n\nHer stage 1 card notes that humans knew about demonic forces. Demons viewed humans as unreliable and undeserving of any happiness. If I have to guess why the creators would put this piece of info in her card, strongly suggests that she along with other demons viewed humans as such.\n\nHer stage 2 cards speak of a demon. Because it is on her card, the demon in question must be her. In this card, it is said that Belphegor possesses knowledge that led unlucky humans to ruin.\n\nHer stage 3 card notes that in exchange for knowledge she wanted humans to partake in blood sacrifices, and the ones involved with her were eager to do so.\n\nAnd finally her stage 4 card notes that humans agreed with the terms of gaining knowledge, which seem to back up the claim in her stage 3 card that humans were still willing to partake blood sacrifices. But it is also added that the reason why Belphegor would collaborate with humans is beyond human comprehension.\n\nSo in conclusion, Belphegor is in many ways, similar to Azazel. In her case, if I were to put both games' lores into consideration, she offers humans knowledge and gold in exchange for someone's soul. Similar to how Favaro's dad's friend got involved with the demon to get rid of both Kaisar's and Favaro's fathers and get demonic powers in exchange. Shadowverse makes it sound like she is tricking the humans, but with RoB lore in consideration, it seems that she just wants a soul, which involved blood sacrifices. Considering that she believes that humans don't deserve any happiness, she makes it a game to get someone's soul by getting involved with shady humans like the friend of Favaro's dad, who are more than willing to sacrifice people. This also led humans involved to ruin. The reason for this is implied to be that she believes that all humans are the same and don't deserve happiness. Kind of like a xenophobic person who believes that all Muslims are terrorists and so puts them all into one group. Except she is probably much more worse by getting involved with people who are evil by making them partake in her sacrifices so that she would bestow unto them knowledge, at the expense of someone's soul, who may be an innocent one. So ultimately she is not only leading people into ruin, but she is also giving bad people gold and knowledge at the expense of human souls. So in what way is she really aiding humanity? Because I do not see it. If anything it's like saying that Favaro's and Kaisar's fathers' killer is aiding humanity, based on what you claimed at least."

At the very least Michael and/or any of the angels should have responded to her plight. In S1 in the scene where Uriel was getting fed with grapes by little angels while she, Gabriel, Rafael and Michael were talking, the angels said something along the lines that they shouldn't really aid humans TOO MUCH. Not saying that they don't. They do, but they don't want to FULLY aid them like equals. This makes them willfully neglectful. Michael when dying expressed his regret that the gods failed their allies by viewing them as being below them instead of allies as they did years ago before Bahamut was sealed. So even Michael admits that the angels stopped viewing humans, their supposed allies as their equals. Gabriel seemed to be the kind of individual who is no different from a demon that views humans as inferior, and the other Angels seem to share the view, except Michael."

Another example is legands of the Galatic Heroes which barring a couple of people everyone does some pretty messed up shit.

   "text": "Yes it does have a different impact because Lelouch was the protagonist of his series, whereas Charioce is the antagonist of his series. Nonetheless they are still both characters that are very similar.  \n\nIn fact if Nina wasn't the protagonist and it was Charioce instead, people might root for him. But then again people were more or less expecting Kaisar and Favaro to be the main characters again and have Kaisar scream \"FAVARO!!!\" because it was funny back then. So it makes me wonder if people actually care about good storytelling. That or they just want a repeat of a similar story like in S1 and have RoB pull a Star Wars EP7 which was just a recycled version of Star Wars EP4. Because so far, this series hasn't been bad, though Nina does kind of annoy me slightly at times. Still it's not that big of a problem.\n\nAlso it is very rare if at all, we get to have a villain be presented properly as a person rather than in the last minute or never at all, like in most anime nowadays. So I am hoping that maybe Charioce takes the center stage in the second cour and have Nina be the decoy protagonist in this series. That way we get to learn more from him as a character."

   "text": "True, but remember how during S1 when supposedly it was a time after Bahamut had its rampage 1000 years ago? And despite the team up between the 3 races, gods and demons are still in conflict? With humans being caught in the middle. I still remember when Azazel was made aware of the God Key theft and intended to get it for the demons, strongly suggesting that despite them uniting once, there still exist a power struggle between them. And humans who revere the gods are still getting affected. So we can't really say that it was peaceful, between the three races. And they were simply surviving as Charioce pointed out to Kaisar when faced with his ideology. \n\nYes there was no need to steal the god's powers. But, like I said, perhaps the gods should have just given the humans that power, and from what is shown thus far, should have just been given to Charioce IMO. Considering from what his motivations that are known thus far. But granted we still don't know the full nature of this \"power\" so the gods' decision to not simply hand it over could be justified when it will be revealed. And I am simply stating my current opinion with what is shown in the show thus far.\n\nThe demons on the other hand, well are just arrogant, using Azazel as a prime example. But there hasn't been much fleshing out made for demons so far (aside from Azazel who is hard to root for), and the attack that the demon had 7 years ago before S2 when a demon attacked a poor village and killed a little girl makes it harder to sympathize. We can see them suffering which makes the viewer feel sad for them, but IMO the show has yet to show a demon's POV other than Azazel which would paint them as being the same as humans. At the very least though, we can see some humans feeling uneasy with the inhumane treatment the demons have been getting, so it's something I guess, which could allow for humans and demons to understand each other. Kind of like how the Jews were treated in WWII, where not all Germans were sympathetic to the Nazi cause and viewed the Jews as being equal as such."

   "text": "Yes, I agree with your points. Also Charioce can be arrogant, which can be a factor that could lead to his possible most likely defeat by the end of the series. Unless Charioce makes a reform on his policies and if a huge chunk of the population start to sympathize with the demons and make protests for change, it would only be a matter of time when demons will start rebelling and make the kingdom crumble. But with way things are, something significant will have to happen to convince him otherwise. Which is why I think for now, Charioce needs to get more power for humans from the gods to stand above them. But so far, the humans are still in a barbaric mind set like that of Ancient Rome. Heck they even hold gladiatorial fights like those of Ancient Rome, where instead of foreigners fighting, it's demons instead. And Emperors back then have to appease the masses. So I assume Charioce has to do the same for his people. But so far, there has only been a few people who stood up to Charioce as seen in the latest episode. And that simply isn't enough to make him change his mind IMO, since it has to be a majority, so having knights deal with them for now at least is still somehow justified, since they will be labelled as mere rebels and outlaws. We can see people feeling uneasy about demons being abused, so there is perhaps potential in-universe for the three races to co-exist despite the skirmishes in the past. \n\nWe should also remember the setting of the series. Considering slavery is a thing in the story and gladiatorial fights are being held, we can say for certainty they don't have a system that is the equivalent of human rights which was established after WWII. They haven't really have had a major conflict like in our world such as WWI and WWII, so IMO there has to be war to force all races in that world to realize that despite differences they can co-exist.  And we can't really use Bahamut's rampages as an example, because the three races are just fighting together for survival, as already pointed out by Charioce, as it is just like trying to survive in a major disaster and needing as much help as needed as possible and having to rely on other races out of desperation. This is where Kaisar missed the mark on his reasoning, which most likely didn't convince Charioce to change his ways."

The current leader of the Gods on the other hand is manipulating a bonafide WMD with the emotional maturity and reasoning of a teenager, which strikes me as grossly incompetent.\n\nUltimately losses on both sides with a peace struck afterwards would be the best outcome but nobody would be able to lead the humans and make peace with angels and devils at the same time because of how unpopular that would be once people forgot the horrors of war. \n\nSo seeing as everything is screwed in the long run at this point anyway I'd rather his smug ass gets kicked to the curb."

I'm not sure what his intention was with that line...)\n\nFAVAROOOOO!"

I think she is more confused than heart broken and think she will be back in her feet next episode!\nThe only thing that will get me made at the writers if they don't go some where with that relationship because it would make no since to set it all up just for it to disappear.\nI thought about it alot and it would make no sense in anyway to set Nina liking the antagonist other than it leading to some where. She could have fallen in love with anybody in this series and it would have done the same effect with her dragon morphing. \nThe relationship doesn't make sense to make her hate him because\u200b she already did or to learn a lesson which doesn't make a while lot of sense. There has to be a story with it because this was set up sense ep 3.\nSo please writes give me something that will satisfy!"
