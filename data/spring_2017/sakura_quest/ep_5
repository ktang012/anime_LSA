They both complete each other's flaws.\n\nSo in the end, Shiori's sister is just a bigger goofball that makes small mistakes that turn into bigger ones just because she's distracted easily.\n\nI'll update the wardrobe summary in a bit.

But that is my own personal tastes. I do admit that the past few episodes have been very strong, especially this Shiori arc has been fantastic. I also am enjoying how SQ is giving equal focus to all the other girls instead of just mainly focusing on Yoshino, which I don't remember the other two shows doing as well (could be misremembering). So all in all I do think SQ is heading in the right direction if the past few episodes are any indication. "

   "text": "I'm joining these threads late, guys, but I've read all of the previous discussions and I'm with you. I'm liking this lovely show a lot!\n\nThere's something I find pretty interesting and that seems few people have commented: the *leitmotiv* of the episode names. I find them very clever with their fantastical and literary allusions! And very fitting, since it seems that Alexandre Celibidache is like the show's narrator. As he speaks and acts like a fantasy literature bard, in a very artsy way, it's lovely how he \"names\" every chapter:\n\n**Ep 1: Off to magical Manoyama!**: The only odd name of them all. I think it doesn't need explanation: Yoshino goes to Manoyama to fulfill her work. The \"magical\" keyword foreshadows the fantasy leitmotiv of the rest of the series, and perhaps states a hint of how Yoshino's work as the Queen of Chupakabura will change her life and vision of the village in an unexpected way.\n\n**Ep 2: The Gathering of the Five Champions**: Name alludes on how Yoshino recruits Shiori, Sanae, Maki and Riri for helping her on fulfilling her duties and \"win\" her quest. Thus, here are the Five Champions: Five heroes, fighters who battle for victory in their struggles (and how it's established in the next episodes, each one is an expert in something, thus another turn on the Word \"champion\").\n\n**Ep 3: The Cry of the Mandrake**: A mandrake is a venomous plant whose root resembles a human form. Folklore and myths state that it emitted a deadly noise -\"cry\"- after being unearthed and was also thought it could be used for medicine or rituals. In this show it makes reference to the mascot contest and Manoyama's old mascot, Kabura-kun, which is basically a humanoid radish. The usage of \"cry\" also implies sadness and states on how it was forgotten in favor of the chupacabras by Kadota.\n\n**Ep 4: The Lone Alchemist**: As you surely know, alchemists are cryptoscientists and philosophers who impliedly could change the composition of materials and turn metals into other ones. This kind of scientific resonance makes reference to Doku, the engineer who repairs Shiori's van and inspires the women to use engineering devices (such as the exoskeleton and the sculpture-that-turns-into-vending-machine) as a tourist attraction. As he lives isolated from the town and the rest of inhabitants in his workshop, here is the \"lone\" factor.\n\n**Ep 5: The Budding Yggdrasil**: \"Yggdrasil\" is the name given to the giant tree that represented the nexus between worlds (or the cosmos) in the Norse mythology. Hereby, I think this name has to do with the arranged project of turning Manoyama's rail station into an architectural wonder. Its conception around *ranma* and wood and slow development ties back to trees and the \"budding\" factor means it just has begun to grow, so in a near future it will turn into something magnificent (as the Yggdrasil is supposed to be).\n\n**Ep 6: The Rural Masquerade**: There are two meanings of \"Masquerade\" I can relate to Sakura Quest: A Masked Ball and a Farce. Naturally, both of them have to do with the shooting and the movie that is taking place here. As a farce, the shooting is representing scenes that aren't real (zombies), and as a masked ball, actors are playing as characters they don't really are, just as they were in disguise. Of course, it could also allude to the nonsense and agitation that the shooting is bringing around the town, and such a grotesque situation could also be literarily called a \"farce\". It takes place in Manoyama, hence the \"rural\" factor.\n\n**Ep 7: The Mansion in Purgatory**: This one's easy. Of course it has to do with the abandoned house Shiori was defending. The usage of \"purgatory\" may refer to the concept of afterlife, since it houses the memories of a beloved deceased person, or the fact in the movie it is used for closing the zombie portal. But I prefer to see that it has to do with its burning, because the concept of \"fiery purgatory\" is a common place in arts and literature.\n\n**Ep 8: The Fairy's Recipe**: I don't see \"Fairy\" here in a literal way, but as a more extravagant manner for saying \"magical\" or \"charming\", since it alludes to the search of the perfect dish the women are looking for. It could also imply the difficulty of its reaching albeit its great reward, because traditionally fairies are seen as impossible to find, and an object of a great luck if found.\n\n**Ep 9: The Lady's Scale**: This week's one is a little trickier. I think it refers to the misunderstanding between Kumano and Shiori's sister on what day they should have met. Impliedly it was because she was looking at an outdated calendar, so it was another way of measure time, by her own \"scale\".\n\n(Yeah, I love analyzing texts!! xDDD)"
