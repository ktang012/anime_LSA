But Ctholy's reaction felt as if Willeim might disappear and never come back.... so now I am very confused, and not sure if Ctholly was overreacting a bit or it was a reasonable reaction because this guy is like a huge shot that can determine the fate of where Willeim will go in the future (and somehow Ctholly also knows this guy is such a big shot?).

Like, his emotions and the name drop are supposed to build tension and intrigue, but it really just falls flat since the name doesn't have any meaningful connotation to the viewer.

But boy, that 'red scene with voices' was exceptionally well done, its an atmosphere that only the anime can pull off. If you got some inexplicable chills from that, that's what they were going for, I would say it was done better than in LN.\n\nThe main conflict of this episode was the annhilation knights. A lot of things was changed from the LN here, and thus the pacing was rather off. But they managed to convey the main point here:\n\nDeep down, Willem still wanted to fight, so he can die and join his friends and families of the past. But thankfully, Ctholly and the other fairies are here, he has a home that he can return to.\n\nAnd then, ofc, cue the ending of this episode. Now the girls have fufilled their promise to live and return, Willem was stopped from returning home with them. It would be obvious but still [ ](/s \"brace yourself for the feel trains\")\n\n...and yes, for those who somehow recognizes my username, I am still working on that [lore&spoiler document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpJFH2Z6xoOc48FqWH3zNiP7E_31edhtPRcpzhikbgs/edit?usp=sharing), the past week has been quite hectic for me between moving and starting summer courses, I can't promise when but I will finish it.\n\nNext week's episode should conclude the events of vol2 of LN. At this rate it seems we are getting 4volumes of adaptation, and perhaps vol5 for OVA? I don't see them dragging out vol3 to fit the remaining 6-7 episodes, nor cramming vol4 and 5 into 3-4 episode at the end, especially with the LN author as script writer.\n\nAlso next week I will do an outline of what was different and what exposition was cut from vol2, as I did in the episode 3 [thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/67hhu1/spoilers_shuumatsu_nani_shitemasu_ka_isogashii/dgqooex/) which covered vol1.\n\nOn a sidenote, I can't wait for the next episode\n\n[LN spoiler](/s \"Souwong and Willem's interaction will be great, and there will most likely be the first heartbreaking scene too\")\n\nEdit: As great as Ctholly is, Nephren is best girl.

I'm guessing that in the end the braves were unsuccessful, the curse ended, some of the emnetwihts reverted back to beasts and wiped out the rest of the emnetwihts.

Felt weird to me with the pacing.\n\nWe start off with a recap of the battle while Nephren sits on Willem's lap cause...\n\nThen we go on a giant tour of the city while Ctholly is starting those early stages of that red thing that clearly isn't good news based off the OP. We did learn that Willem does still hold a pretty strong desire for battle again although it's more like fighting just so he can go to where his older family and comrades-in-arms are at. And then we learned something clearly important to Willem with the mention of Kandel.  \n\nAbsolutely adored the Willem x Ctholly dialogue in those last couple of scenes. It's just super cute.\n\n[We got a nice **confessional reveal**](#feelsgoodman)\n\nGee wiz this is a nice season for romance fans. Even the romance subplots seem to be moving well.\n\nI dunno if it was more of a monologue on Ctholly's part or it was the real deal (honestly with how the show presents it I'm thinking the former but I have garbage interpretation skills) but either way super cute.\n\nThe mention of Souwong Kandel clearly got to Willem enough to make him change his mind about coming along. Is it some code name? An old comrade? Some project? Whatever it was it was clearly enough to make Willem ditch a teary Ctholly so *it must have been rather big*. \n\nAnd gee wiz if it weren't for the first scene of the first episode which seemingly shows what happens in the future, I would have pointed out all the damn death flags with all the *I'll return* and *you brought me a little happiness*.\n\nKind of makes me wish they didn't have that first scene cause it would have made these moments a bit more *umph* to me but we're not even halfway through so we'll see what happens next.\n\nI can't really grasp at what this show is trying to do but I'm certainly enjoying each episode quite a bit. \n\nOh and those gollems are weirdly adorable. So simple but they look so eager to do it to where I get a stupid smile when I see those things in action."

Two things that suffer the most are world building and characterization. Atmosphere/mood and impact of dramatic moments are also weaker.\n\nDon't get me wrong, this is still a good anime in my opinion. And it's not a bad adaptation either. It is simply not possible to show everything when they have only 12 episodes to work with. But it's kind of frustrating to see something great and unique turn into something that's \"just good\".\n\nAnyhow, if you're not averse to reading, then I strongly suggest to check the original LN. It's being fan-translated currently and 4 out of 5 volumes are already available in English."

Easily stole the whole episode.\n\nNow since that is out of the way, the episode   is a nice transition between the despair of las tweek and next portion of the story, at the same time  opening up a window into the town's customs, lore and politics, giving us some very nice and needed worldbuilding. \n\nWe start off with Willem being absolutely adamant on not interfering in anything and taking up a stance that people with right motives can't use violence because it is never good. Now that is nice idealistic stance but it is not always true, especially when one's rights are in question - when people come at you for being different you won't be able to reason with them or talk things through. Although it makes sense that Willem would have a very flawed pacifistic outlook towards life, because his whole species was destroyed due to war. And he is clearly using it as an excuse because of his own inability to do really do anything and and because he does not want to get people around him into even more  trouble. \n\nAlas in the end, Willem does get a chance to actually be useful and to actually do something that matters, which is EXTREMELY important in terms of his development. If last episode was about Willem's innability to be of any use and his struggle and horrifying despair stemming from that, this episode offered him some cathartic ability to actually do things, even if on smaller scale. Sure some things were handled differently and in more agressive fashion here, but I actually like it more here than in the novel because here Willem actually got a chance to vent his frustrations a little and do what he really wanted to do. The final scene with Ctholly and Willem dialogue also was handled a bit better than in the novel and Willem came out as a better person here and it fit nicely into the theme through the episode\n\nOverall a good strong episode can't wait for next week.

I don't know if the adaptation tried to pack in all these little facts from the light novel, but the worldbuilding would have been far better if it'd focused on one thing or one setting. Instead the whole episode is a cluster of ideas that all end up generic because they're so poorly explored.\n\nThe fantasy genre can offer so much better than this. That massage scene in Ep 2 or so was the first red flag for me, and it's been downhill so far. I'm not judging anyone who's enjoying this, just my one cent."

As someone who was a tool for destruction in the past and fought a world ending monster to the death while presumably his comrades bit the dust until only he was left, dieing, only to turn to stone and wake up 500 years later and find out the world was wiped out after he \"died\", he should be under a good amount of stress.  The little flashbacks and mentions of his past life are great.  In a weird way it reminds me of Ken from Kuromukuro.  I hope we get to see more of his past, and for everyone to really understand what he went through.  (i dont think the girls know the full extent of what happened in the past, just that he knows a lot about thier weapons, though Chtulu does know he was one of them in the past, hence her \"you dont have to fight anymore, we will do it for you\" speech.)  \n\nIm loving this show and its one i very much look forward to each week.  \n\n[](#meguminthumbsup)"

There's nothing redeemable about their side or goals. It is VERY clear that the rebels dont like the town or what it represents. It does not make sense to ask that and actually having Willem relieve his frustrations and do something is a welcome change. \n\nThe message that Willem chose to participate this way due to the whole do you like this town still carries across due to conversation Dog Girl and Tiat had during the restaurant scene and Willem's reaction to it.
