They plan on implementing many of the functions a lot of subreddits use CSS for (ex: spoiler tags), but a lot of the lesser-used functions/hacks such as comment faces and hyper-complex sidebars are unlikely to be supported.\n\nBasically every mod who manages a subreddit with unique aspects is not a fan. If a subreddit has a dynamic banner (/r/manga), a constantly-changing sidebar (/r/dota2), overhauls the base subreddit layout in any significant way (/r/overwatch), has in-depth flair customization, etc., then all of that is going to be removed and whether it will be supported by the Reddit-specific tools is a crapshoot. Not to mention every single spoiler tag is going to be revealed when CSS is killed, so it will be impossible to go back to old threads without being spoiled about something. And even if they do plan on supporting features like comment faces, it could take a very long time before they get implemented because Reddit's admins are notoriously slow when it comes to implementing new features."

She was also making Todoroki sticks so he could touch the ground to freeze with.  Amazing team work.  Probably the best in the match with Bakugou's team being 2nd with the harden up front and the tape in back for retrieval and the acid to deal with CCs.  3rd play of course going to the Shoji Tank team with Mineta and Tsuyu.  Funny enough, Deku's team would be pretty low on team synergy since the whole fight was just him and Falco fighting (yes Uraraka 0G'd them so they were mobile, and Mei had the gadgets to help them stay mobile, but ide still rank them below the tank."

They got the jetpack to fly, but that was only possible because Uraraka 0G'd them all so the jetpack only had to support her weight. But between the three of them, they have literally zero defensive powers, so they needed someone to defend them from all sides, not just take care of his. Most people other than Tokoyami would have run into the same problem Todoroki did: they can't defend the sides opposite to them without hurting their teammates. And even after everyone was out to get them, they managed to avoid Iida for 6 minutes without being able to fly thanks to Deku realizing that they just had to stay on Todoroki's fire side.\n\nSo Team Deku synergyzed very well for the one thing they set out to do: run away from everything. Their problem was attacking. If they hadn't lasted so much time or Todoroki had kept his cool, they would have been out, because they had pretty much no chance of stealing from most teams."

The anime is an amazingly faithful adaptation, but it also manages to bring life to certain scenes in ways that are difficult to do in a printed form. Some of them become even more awesome, like All Might's fight against the sludge monster in episode 2, and especially against Noumu in episode 12."

I haven't read much of the manga except for that one chapter (and the few after todays episode since everyone here convinced me to read on lol) and it was absolutely amazing to me how underwhelming that \"plus ultra\" panel felt compared to the anime. not that I thought the manga was bad by any means **whatsoever**, its seriously well made. Its just that the animated medium allowing for such incredible music and voice acting to complement each other, and for the sense of weight you get from watching things actually move made that scene into a fucking shounen masterpiece imo. \n\nI think you're right, theres no way I could've anticipated it being that hype just from having read the manga."

The slower pace allows me to absorb better the story that the first time I kind of binged through, and the art, colours, voices and music are all excellent so that's all an improvement. For me shounen battle shows are the perfect examples of something that works as manga first, anime later because it's all in the awesomeness of the action scenes, and that gets greatly enhanced by animation done right. Like, I liked Chimera Ant in the HXH manga, but Chimera Ant in the HXH 2013 anime was a FUCKING MASTERPIECE. It allowed me to appreciate much more all the details I hadn't caught while reading one chapter after another."

The music, so far, has accentuated the experience and the voice actors really sell it for me. It's like watching your imagination being faithfully (and often stylistically) enhanced.\n\n\nThat being said, I also loved the thrill of just fantasizing what might happen next when i first watched season 1 completely blind. I think either way, this series is very enjoyable to watch."

Deku using one for all, Todo using his flame quick, kacchan going absolutely berserk against that smug motherf***er, Iida (also read that as Lida) showing off his secret technique and much much more!\n\nAlso left me with a very intrigued feeling with regards to todoroki and his relationship with his father, and even more with the relationship between flame-daddy and All might - Obviously they are rivals (at least flame-daddy sees it that way) and it is not hard to guess why, but it still leaves me wanting to know more!\n\nClearly my favorite episode of this season by a **wide margin**, can't wait for next week!

It stops Midoryia from looks OP while at the same time keeps him looking strong because he didn't *lose* because of something stupid he did."

   "text": "Great episode as always!! I'm loving this arc so far. \nI'm really curious to see what Hitoshi Shinso's quirk (purple haired guy) is. It seems like they're keeping it as mysterious as possible until it's his time for the spotlight. \n\nI'm not a manga reader so here's my guess: he has some sort of manipulation quirk. The idea came in episode 2 during [this scene.](http://imgur.com/a/0jYkZ) The people carrying him seem... hypnotized. Like they don't know what they're doing. After this episode I'm almost certain he has some form of mind control ability, forcing Tetsutetsu's team to give up their headbands at the last second. \n\nFrom the preview for episode 6, it looks like Ojiro is [speaking up about something](http://imgur.com/a/pjJ1U) Shinso did during the cavalry battle. They were on the same team and I'm not sure if manipulation would be following the rules, even if it is his quirk. All I know is Ojiro looks guilty and Shinso looks pissed. \n\nSo I'm thinking in the next few episodes or so, he and Deku will inevitably face off against each other and Shinso will get this heartbreaking backstory about how he's always wanted to be a hero, but never could because his quirk wasn't good enough. He is essentially Deku before inheriting One-For-All.\n\nMaybe this wasn't so subtle but I'm still excited to see whatever happens next. And please no spoilers!!"

Doesn't stop us from considering these to be great shows.\n\nAnd they all do recaps for the same reasons. The *upfront reason* is for incase you forgot across a week, and for channel surfers who happen to catch these shows by accident for the first time. That reason carries very small weight since that does not apply to the majority of the existing audience, and the potential audience are going to be hooked by the real content and commonly prefer to see it from the start. The *meaningful reason* is that it pads the episode time slot so that they don't have to create as much content. This can be good for technical reasons such greater focus on the quality of the reduced work, they don't have to stretch out or dilute the manga content to fit the time slot as much, and possibly something about budget. Unfortunately this aspect is about the studio, not the audience, not what we're here for.\n\nSince this is a problem that forever has existed and will continue to, there wasn't much reason to discuss it, but I appreciate you presenting the opportunity to discuss. It's important to be aware of the causes of this, and to acknowledge why it's disliked but tolerated (except for One Piece's regular less than 15 minute episode content, that deserves per episode derision)."

So unless you really enjoy the manga artstyle (imo horikoshi is one of the best artists in jump right now, but that's just me) you dont need to go back and can just go forward from that chapter.\n\nSo do what suits you! I think either way is fantastic. I thoroughly enjoy the anime every week despite being a manga reader and already knowing whats gonna happen - the sheer quality of the adaptation was enough to keep me entertained.
