Basically a big \"fuck you\" to the readers. Many people consider the official end a lot better than had he stuck with the main heroine because... reasons, but in the end it's just... sad. Like, real sad. Mainly because the ending pairing I don't think even stuck together into their adult lives. So it makes the MC wonder if he made the right choice in the end, and it just sort of leaves it at that. The contention comes from the fact that practically *everyone* would have rather the MC go with the his initial love interest since she was clearly the \"best girl\". That's how I remember it, anyway; I'm pretty sure this synopsis isn't 100% accurate, but I read it over a decade ago and only once as I was part of team ichigo underwear.\")"

It ended exactly like I wanted it to end, in my opinion it was a great read and I loved it.\n\n[Spoilers Ichigo 100% a bit long...](/s \"Basically the first girl and the one that got the story moving did not win, but the second girl to appear in the series. The first one is maybe closer to the classical Japanese beauty and a shy girl, think Onodera from Nisekoi but much more interesting and better developed. The second girl is a bit more outspoken and assertive, to continue the Nisekoi comparisons, think Chitoge but much sweeter, decisive and less violent (the nisekoi characters are maybe too one-dimensional for this comparison but they are likely still fresh in the memory of many). Due to a misunderstanding the MC gets into a relationship with girl #2 very early on and its a total failure since he can't stop thinking about girl #1 and girl #2 knows it, after that the series continues for a long time with the MC never sure who he is in love it or if he is even in love with them, sometimes gets a bit annoying and tiresome to be honest but the cast is endearing. The series covers from their last year of middle school up until a bit after their high school graduation, in all that time Girl #1 had a million chances that she never took, while girl #2 got close to the MC again, developed a more natural relationship with the MC and his family (girl #2 even went to a different school and still had more of a presence) many readers wanted girl #1 to win but honestly the story would have needed to twist and disregard a lot of development for that to happen. I did not read it when it was being published and honestly I feel the first girl was sweet but the less developed and most boring of the main 3 options.\")\n\n"

   "text": "Really? That's odd to me, because as the struggling creative types Utaha and Eriri are a lot more conflicting in terms of their needs.\n\nFrom my perspective, Kato just really likes her friends and really likes putting together the visual novels. She gets mad at Aki because when he unilaterally decided to go to Eriri and then basically bail on their deadline, without consulting her *even though she explicitly made herself available*, he demonstrated a lack of trust in her as both a friend and as a partner in the game.\n\nHer feelings for Aki do actually seem fairly complicated, I suppose. In the end she seems to like him, but is constantly frustrated by how dense he is. During the AV room she acts cold to him when he tries to prompt a confession because what kind of moron screws up, doesn't apologize for it, and then insinuates that the only reason you're mad is because you're in love with him? But afterwards he does actually apologize and recognizes how important she is to the team. She forgives him, but is still reasonably upset because she's had to basically isolate herself from everyone for the past two months.\n\nLater on she gets mad at him because when he's describing how people are complex in terms of their feelings, she realizes he isn't quite as hopelessly dense as she had thought, which makes the fact that he still acts like a total moron sometimes and doesn't understand her feelings all the more frustrating. Still, it seems like she's more \"chewing out a troublesome spouse\" than actually getting mad this time.\n\nAs for how she actually feels about him? Well ... Kato isn't dense like Aki is, so it's probably safe to assume she can understand how their playing house routine looks  from everyone else's perspective, but she seems to enjoy it regardless. She clearly thinks that Aki's plan for the next VN is both kinda silly and woefully planned out, and she doesn't seem all that interested in his ramblings (ex. Interrupting him to make him taste-test soup and to pick some rice from his cheek), but she sticks around anyway, so she seems to be entertained nonetheless. She's a bit embarrassed about how uncharacteristically emotional she's been today, and asks him to forget how she was acting by the end of the day. I'll go on a bit of a stretch and say that it's much easier for the people closest to you to file you up and make you act out in unexpected ways, which I think is what's supposed to be taken from that scene, but in the other hand she *does* have like two months of anger pent up, so you can't really blame her either. But the most obvious sign of her feelings is that she bought him a chocolate bar, some clearly low-effort gift that she used to suggest it was just an \"obligatory chocolate\" ... But then she goes out of the way to give it to him after Valentine's Day, when she'd have no actual \"obligation\" to give him anything anymore \ud83d\ude02\n\nSo all things considered, I'd say she's probably into him but also equally frustrated by his dumb antics."

   "text": "Yeah, agreed.\n\nThis episode shed some light on how Kato feels about Aki. if anything, she's like the supportive yet cunning wife who can tolerate her husband's tactics, yet does a LOT of behind-the-scene stuff while he's technically the face of the project. The only issue is that no one seemed to appreciate her efforts, which were settled here.\n\nUtaha and Eriri, on the other hand...I feel like they rely on him too much, when you think about it, especially Utaha.\n\nRarely have they tried to reach out and help Aki through the slumps when he needed it, at least on their own. Instead, they kind of fueled the fire and just let him deal with the damage (which in turn, gave him the idea that he should do everything on his own). While it is true that he hasn't done a good job at being the leader to help them move forward, it's still evident that they want him to keep everything together and not put any effort in themselves. \n\nFor Utaha, one example is Eriri's current slump. Sure, Aki can help her out of it, but why not Utaha? They may not be the best of friends, but this can clearly give Aki the mindset that he needs to do this, once again, on his own, but that may be subverted thanks to Kato. Not to mention Utaha knows why Eriri is like that, and a lot of the advice she gives Aki tends to have that underlining tone that they rely on him to keep everyone together. Another example is, once more, Eriri's slump during the Winter Comiket. Aki was willing to scrap the extra storyline to give her less work, Kato was waiting on Aki's call to help Eriri, but Utaha? She tells Aki what will go down, but as for trying to help Eriri out on her own? You can say she unknowingly caused the drama between Aki and Kato due to, once again, relying on him and not putting any effort in herself to help their fellow member. There's also her light novel situation when she was first starting, where she re-wrote her novel based on his suggestions, and this is after the fact that he told her that he didn't want to influence her novel, and her choosing universities was also up to him instead of her.\n\nEriri, herself, also relies on Aki a bit too much. Basically, she's in her slump because she needs someone to motivate her, instead of trying to seek some motivation on her own. Right now, she wants Aki to come push her, and the fact that she wanted him to do so in both of her slumps kind of proves this. Sure, he's the director, but the major reason she even goes so far is because she wanted him to approve of her work, despite anyone else saying otherwise. Sure, finding someone who can push you to your limits is good, but when you're finding yourself in need of that all the time, then you may have a problem with your reasons for drawing, and this is because one of the major reasons she even draws in the first place is to impress him."

She pretty much felt like he didn't think much of her, despite them spending almost every day with each other for almost a whole year.\n\nI agree with the notion that she doesn't realize that she likes him, but mostly due to LN information. In the AV room scene, when Megumi says, \"What are you talking about, Aki?\" he narrates that she appears completely sincere and confused about his question, and that there's no indication in her expression that she's lying. LN protagonists are dense and Megumi is tough to read though, so who knows?"
