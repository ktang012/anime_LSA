I think it tells a good story for Kotarou, for Akane, and for their relationship that way.\n\nIt shows how Kotarou and his commitment to his relationship with Akane has actually improved his life outside of those aspects. Akane's encouragement is part of what helped him stay motivated to write when his novel got shot down and now he's showing much more dedication to his school work. It shows that childhood relationships aren't always a distraction that take away from other important aspects of life. \n\nAkane showed a lot of growth during the show and I think her convincing Kotarou to go somewhere closer to home would be a great way to show the culmination of that. She was very passive early on and it felt like Kotarou was the only one trying to push their relationship forward. Recently she's been playing a much more active role. I think convincing Kotarou to go to a closer school shows she's comfortable enough with Kotarou to speak against what he wants and that she cares about him enough to worry about his well being.\n\nFor the relationship, it feels like a long distance relationship is the best option for them. The entrance exams alone have been taking their toll on Kotarou and he hadn't even had to deal with the 2 hour each way commute yet. It feels like something is going to give between the commute, new classmates, his grades in a tough school, and his personal work writing. Trying to balance all that will likely end with him so exhausted he can't give any of those aspects the attention they need to be successful. However, it's obvious from the way Akane and Kotarou have acted these last couple episodes that they really don't want things to end just because of the distance. The show has also been going out of their way to show how much they communicate though line and the EDs are filled with line chats of long distance relationships. "

   "text": "Great parents indeed! Kotarou's mom really wanted to give full support to him as she realised Kotarou is seriously studying for his selected school and not just playing around as she initially thought. (Kotarou never really told them he had a girlfriend nor discuss much else as seen from previous episodes of their family dinner) Once Kotarou told them to 'shut up' it made his parents rethink the way they were treating him. Seeing his mom actually staying up late to make him food made me cry like a bitch.\nAlso wanted point out the parallel between Kotarou eating after the fight he had between the parents and after seeing his mom. He was first reluctant to eat his moms food, but after seeing her cook late at night for him, he didnt give it a second thought. Its the little things that make it a great episode in my heart.\n\nAnd there is his dad too. He noticed the relationship between Kotarou and his mom were shaky and wanted to patch things up between them by letting him know that they arent against his choice, and he can freely do what he wants so long as he has a backup plan (public school if he failed) and that he would takes responsibility. [long sentence but wanted to put it out there] The dad was a great middle man of the two and a real understanding father!!!\n\nAnd the morning of the exam. It was only for a minute but the last few scenes reminded me so much of how my parents were like when I had exams. They would already be up before I was,  preparing my lunch and making sure I didn't forget anything. There was so much I could relate to my experiences. And the scene when the parents were outside sending Kotarou off. Baring with the cold of early morning to watch him leave safely. Made me appreciate how great it is to have your parents full support into your life decisions.\n\nThis episode was really great and moved me so much. Even though it doesn't focus much on the romantic aspect (maybe it did but I was too moved by the parents), I want to say this was the best episode in anime that showed parental love being portrayed realistically (and I never would expected it from reading its synopsis!). Really sad that there is only one more episode to wrap this series up when theres so much to see from the main couple and the people around them.\n"

Akane's older sister is such a delight when she's on screen and she has a point; couples like these are such a one in a million rarity, so she's looking out for her which is sweet as always :) Does it really end next week? I feel like it can continue; while I am a bit sad this series has to end it has been so amazing to watch week by week. My small regret though is that we may never see either family ever getting to know the couple which I would have loved to see that all laid out with their interactions.

That first 3 minutes with Kotarou's mom was the most realest interaction with a parent I've seen for a while. While the last few minutes of this episode is probably the most I've related with this episode, I've gotten fights with my parents before but just like most Asian parents there's usually no dramatic apologies or anything to make up. There's just this silent agreement that they're cool now and I really liked how they did that.\n\nAlso props to Akane's sister for being realistic. Of course the ideal thing is for Kotarou and Akane to be together forever, but that won't always be the case and you need to think ahead just in case they do break up, which I really hope doesn't happen."

They will more than likely not be in the same homeroom. They probably won't have any of the same classes. They might not even have lunch at the same time so they might not even be able to share lunch together. So how much time would they get to spend together during the schoolday?

If Kotarou hangs around for her, he could spend a few minutes with her before they each head home for the night. \n\nTravel time every day: four hours.
