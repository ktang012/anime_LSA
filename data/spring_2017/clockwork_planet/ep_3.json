   "text": "Personally, I wouldn't recommend it.  There's a self-selecting bias for folks who are still in discussion threads 10 episodes in; as a few others have said, if you didn't like the first episode, you almost certainly won't like the rest of the show.  I loathe dropping shows, so I'm finishing this one out, but it's just not very well executed.\n\nI like a \"dumb fun\" show as much as the next guy, so it's not coming from a place of elitism. I just found that all the drama and character motivations fall flat, and the action is not nearly good enough to make up for it. The MC's antics can be funny, but they also get to the point where they simply don't make sense and it pulls you out of the show.  They would work better if the show was way less serious overall (like, say, High School DxD), but because it keeps trying to insert serious plot elements, you end up getting mood whiplash, and not in a well-planned way.\n\nAlso, this is a really minor complaint, but the author (I'm assuming this stems from the LN source) has some weird fixation on throwing out super specific numbers left and right, and it really started to get on my nerves after a while (perhaps emblematic of the show as a whole).  Here's a random piece of dialogue like that (doesn't spoil anything):\n\n>From your location, jump up 52.3 meters.  \n>Rotate 47.5 degrees horizontally, then jump another 14.25 meters.  \n>After you arrive, there will be a loose gear with a diameter of 0.7 micrometers.  \n\nYou'll get multiple bits of dialogue like this every episode, and it's totally immersion breaking.  I get that the characters are supposed to be geniuses and all, but this level of specificity strains credibility, seems completely unnecessary, and in the case of that small gear, makes no sense. A human hair is about 50 micrometers in diameter, so a 0.7 micrometer gear would be invisible to the naked eye...but it's clearly shown in the show without magnification, probably more on the order of millimeters in diameter.\n\n**TL;DR: Want a silly comedy show? Check out Renai Boukun. But if you didn't like the first episode of Clockwork Planet, you can feel confident in dropping this show.**"

   "text": "I don't think the show is good but I can watch and enjoy parts of it.\n\nPros are if you just want to watch something light hearted and comical. Jokes aren't amazing but I enjoy them enough. I think the character designs are great. I like the quirkyness of the characters as well.\n\nCons are that ultimately it's not the most entertaining thing ever. The story is kinda boring to me personally.\n\nIt basically rides on you enjoying character interactions. While it's a bit cheap, if you like the characters then you'll find it watchable."

   "text": "It's a very specific show for specific people.\n\nPeople who like fun. Because that's what this show is. It's just pure fun. I'd argue it's an action comedy, though the action is nothing special, but the comedy is fantastic.\n\nAll the characters are a lot of fun. The Naoto knows what he wants and goes for it. RyuZU is sharp tongued with great dere moments. Even Marie it's a lot of fun.\n\nIf you didn't like it on episode one, I don't think you'll come to like it, but I wouldn't call it particularly generic. Though I haven't seen many shows from pre-2007."

Naoto is hilarious and is very shameless with his kinks and fetishes and RyuZU is an absolute treat to watch, the relationship between them is pretty nice too. While RyuZU insults Naoto a lot she never gets violent with him and shows that she's pretty much in love with him as much as Naoto is with her.\n\nNothing special with the animation but the use of 3D for the gears is pretty neat. Soundtrack is one of the best this season though.\n"
