   "text": "The US draws the line for the eage of consent at 18 and many states just can't accept that people have sex before 16, but the age of consent in Japan and in most of Europe (if we go by the names and written language of the series) are commonly around 14 or 15 years old, and in this fantasy/post-apocaliptic war-torn setting who knows?  I think that a couple of teenagers that have experienced the stuff they have been through and have resigned to give their lives for the defense of their race cannot be held to our standards when they decide who they want to shag before they go out to die (and probably not gonna get that far, going by the genre of this novel).\n\nAnd even if we base it on our own reality, it's not like he's a 20 something year old and she's just 9 or 10.  Ctholly is 15 or 16 and Willem is 18 or 19 at most (he was 18 when he got petrified, and was revived just a few months before). A couple of 15 and 18 (which is illegal to you) is acceptable to me but not one where they are 13 and 17, but by US law only the second one is okay.  I live in a country where the age of consent is lower and both are oky by law, but mi acceptance of the first and objection to the second example are not for legal resons, but in terms of the physical and mental development of the people involved. Suspend your disbelief for a while and remember this is a fictional setting with another culture and different laws, and their 3 years of difference is the least problematic thing they have to worry about."

She has the mind of a child basically which in any culture is not appropriate to be taken advantage of.

Lucky for her that the only remaining human turned out to be a decent guy. \nI don't think it's ever gonna get past that infatuation from her part or maybe a kiss between them before everything goes FUBAR, but given how the characters are written, specially Willem, I don't feel that uncomfortable with it."

Between everything said/happening in the last episode and the ominous scene at the very start of EP1, it seems like this train is inevitably headed for Suffering Central and all the pretty stops on the way are just to make it that much worse when we get there. I can't figure if they've presented it like this to lessen the blow of the seemingly inevitable results, or in order to make any kind of happy end completely blindside us. At the moment I'm having a hard time believing in the second one (at least for Ctholly), which just makes it depressing to watch her.\n\n\nIt's funny because I find one of the worst things a show can do is to make the happy ending feel inevitable, the kind where you know all along that the conflicts and hardship is just for show and somehow everything will magically work out. This somehow feels exactly the opposite, and I guess I'd prefer some middle-ground, regardless of the actual outcome. Just give me some rope SukaSuka, a string, anything to hold on to, anything to make me believe...\n\n\nI dont know, that was just my quick rant.

And why he chooses the title of the first chapter of vol.3 as a next episode (ep8), is a kind of a hint what he is going to do. But I don't know exactly what it means since I'm not LN reader....\nhttps://twitter.com/a_kareno/status/867404019811078144\n\nBTW, if someone has a question, he/she might find a hint of that in the LN author's tweet as Japanese people always has similar questions as here and the LN author responds without any spoiler so far.\n\nEDIT.\n"

So new characters x2 = Lantolq and Noft added. The author told that the episode 6 finished beautifully, and not-a-beautiful story begins from episode 7.\n\n\n* Recently the LN author emphasizes that the anime adaptation is \u201ca story of Chtholly\u201d, that implies it is not of \u201cChtholly and Willem\u201d. That could mean either:\n --The anime will cover up to LN volume 5 but skips most of the episodes in volume 3 and 4 especially about Willem\u2019s part.\n --The anime will cover up to volume 3, and go back to the beginning of the ep1.\n\nEDIT: paragraph format, grammar and minor correction"

   "text": "There are many great LNs, but what will be interesting to you depends on your preferences.\n\nAlso, even if you have already watched anime adaptation, it still may be a decent idea to read the original. Most adaptations leave out a lot because they are constrained by their budget and limited screen time.  \nBesides, it's also pretty rare for adaptation to cover the whole story. For example, Spice and Wolf anime, both seasons, only covers 4 volumes out of 17.\n\nGetting back to the recommendations, there was a relevant topic at /r/LightNovels just several days ago (there is a comment with my recommendations in it too):  \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/LightNovels/comments/6bopp7/completed_ln_recommendations/\n\nTo learn a bit more about titles mentioned in there, just find them at NovelUpdates or MangaUpdates and check their genres + tags. Although, tags at both websites can contain spoilers, or some of them can even be wrong/inaccurate (it's maintained by users after all). So it's better to be careful and take them with a grain of salt.  \nLinks to fan-translations, or information about which company has licensed the novel, is usually found at NovelUpdates.\n\nAnd lastly, when you talk about picking Re:Zero, do you mean vol 1-3 officially translated by Yen Press? Just curious."
