The only thing I could remember looking out of the window was just farmland.\n\nHowever, if Sakura Quest was out last year, I would have definitely stopped and visited this little farm town and buy some local treats and souvenirs, which might contribute to local economy in small ways.  I bet a lot of other anime lovers would too, even if the town is nothing special. \n\nSo if girls in Sakura Quest really want to successfully attract tourists, they should definitely contact Miyamori and Musani to make an anime about Manoyama XD\n\nThat would be meta on so many levels..."

   "text": "The episode ended on a weird note - that or I'm just not used to drama being handled this calmly. Sanae said her piece and decided she was going to leave (?), and the episode ended. Either way, glad they're tackling *karoshi* head-on, and I think it's a nod to the epidemic of death by overwork gripping Japan. Yet they're not paining Sanae's decision to leave her job in a good light, and it makes me wonder what Sanae should be doing instead of working in Manoyama? Go back to her job in Tokyo? That's not the nicest message, but I guess we'll find out next time. In fact I don't think the dude was being all that reasonable. \n\nSandal-san's appearance was gloriously weird as usual. Probably not going to have much more screentime than he already does, but I'll take what I can get. \n\nFor all of Yoshino's enthusiasm, her efforts are merely being rewarded with scorn - it can be hard to work in an environment where the residents are largely resistant to change. As the last episode pointed out, however, they don't *see* the need for change. I can't say they're right, because the town is clearly stagnating and will die out if nothing is done in the next few years, but it appears Yoshino isn't going to challenge them out of respect to the townsfolk. The vending machine Buddha was a genuinely cool idea and seeing the townsfolk react like that didn't fill me with joy. It's going to be interesting to see if Yoshino can change the town's mind alongside juggling the gang's personal issues, as well as battling her own demons. \n\nI think it's clear by now that Chupakabura is a terrible idea and should be retired entirely, lol.

It's not going to bring thousands of new tourists flocking to the town and cause new businesses to start in the area.

Yoshino's story of being about to graduate and suddenly realizing \"oh shit, what the hell do I do with my life now?\" followed by many failed interviews and then taking the first job offered to her is basically exactly where I was about 10 years ago.\n\nSanae's story this episode about working so hard and then discovering that her effort didn't really matter, that she was just a cog in the machine, just another body, also hits home pretty hard.  I wonder if part of the reason this show has a lowish MAL score is because the problems and situations the characters have are really more adult problems, and since the anime fandom trends younger then that they just don't identify with the characters quite so much?  Pure speculation on my part, but I do wonder.\n\nThat said, I probably shouldn't have watched this right before going to a job interview.  Woops."

Since it doesn't try to make you laugh a lot (just some smiles & a couple of laughs an episode) I feel a lot of people will think, \"this isn't funny.\". And yet I watch it with a near constant grin, the humour is right up my street.\n\n- adult cast, rural town setting, not exactly relatable for most anime fans as you said.\n\n- slow-ish start. I've loved it, but I know a couple of people who dropped because they feel \"nothing's happening\" so far.\n\n- peaceful tone. There's no action, there's been little drama so far, no violence/edginess. Makes for a blissful change from a lot of other shows, but to teenage boys they'll get bored. It's too calm and mature for most teenagers to be interested imo. 'Soothing' is the word that comes to mind."

It is a lot less geared towards the individual, and much more towards the group and/or the company. As a result, people work long hours (the tradition is you stay until your boss leaves, even if it means overtime) prioritise work and generally feel tied to their position in a workplace (especially given that a lot of people stay within a company for their entire worklives).\n\nI am by no means saying this is at all healthy, nor even that everyone in Japan is doing it.

He probably thinks that the art is disrespected this way and no one is looking at it with passion like he does. \n\nI also liked that vending machine, looked really cool. \n\nI'm not sure if the drama with Sanae wanting to give up was too overblown at the end, was not feeling that. Her explaining the situation she was in before, that was informative and good though."

Wasn't a fan of the random car chase scenes in Shirobako and I definitely won't like stuff like the exoskeleton in a rural area like that. I get the idea that it could be some outcast crazy dude who wanted to get away from the city life but it's rather hard to believe that a dude that has the capacity to create exoskeletons and wacky vending machines that look like a jukebox would be chilling here but whatever this is a stupid nitpick.\n\nI'm kind of surprised we're already going into some light drama with Sanae (and early *romance* hints as well). Interested to see how the gang helps her out!"

Considering Shirobako was a love letter to the anime industry, it was probably an homage to Initial D. Maybe if he realized that he would appreciate the car chase more. \n\nAnyway, thanks for the link to the \"Initial PA Works\" video. Definitely saving it. :D\n\n"
