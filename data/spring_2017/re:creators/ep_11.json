I think that even the hair colors are pretty much the same. \n\nI mean, Mamika can still have Sakura elements with her character, but I felt strongly that Madoka is the basis here. I mean, it even has the same hairstyle and it kinda... freaks? in the same way. If I remember well, Sakura in CCS is pretty much level headed in almost the entirety of the show/manga. That's why I feel it is more Madoka than anything... and besides, if it is more Madoka the marketing would be easier and function leagues better than with Sakura. That's what I think.\n\nEdit: I can't believe that the VA for freaking Gunpuku is the very same that is doing Sanae in Alice to Zouroku. I can't wrap my mind around this.

I do think that Sakura could react a lot better than Madoka in every way.\n\nTalking of symbolism and inspiration, I would argue that whatever Madoka took inspiration from in the end it doesn't matter, the franchise is on a point where it has its own identity that it cannot be compared to CCS. It is like comparing the dude that appeared in the end of this episode with Jojo just because they both have something that looks like a Stand.\n\nThat's how I feel it and it is why I don't see CCS within her. Of course, if we go through the genre tropes then yeah, she has CCS elements, as well as Cutie Honey elements, Precure and even Nanoha, but I don't think comparing these characters this way will leave us with something meaningful or effective in telling us where Mamika is taken from."

   "text": "My theory for the military girl is that she came from the girl who killed herself at the beginning of episode one. She wrote a story about a girl who was feed up with the world, killed herself, and was reincarnated with power in another world. She either actually reincarnated, the military girl just thinks she was a \"Creator\" in her previous life, or the military girl is enacting as her creator's (last)will. \n\nThe speech she gave Selestia in the beginning sounds like the sort of thing someone feed up society might say. The theme of the show seems to be about free will. Making you own discussions vs doing what another tells you to do. If the suicidal girl didn't think she was able make her own discussions regarding her life either from her teacher, friends, or more likely, her own creators(ei her parents), that may have been the motivation to end her own life.\n\nThere are a number of commit-suicide-and-be-rewarded-with-a-better-life type stories. Too many actually for a country with as high a suicide rate as it does. \n\n**Edit**: I forget another connection suicide girl and military girl have. In the opening credits he have a scene with suicide girl falling backwards(into water?), transitions to skulls, transitions to military girl with blooming roses. I looked it up, but I don't think there's a connection with Flower Language. Not really my field of expertise, but there's too many different colors of roses in that scene and each rose color has it's own meaning.\n\n**one more Edit**: \n> Flower Language: [White and Coral together, You\u2019re heavenly and I desire you.](http://www.angelfire.com/journal2/flowers/roses4.html)\n\nI don't know. The color arrangement is close to what's described. It's obvious that military girl knows the MC. I had originally thought that they might have been classmates. With the flowers and the MC's past attempts at art, the MC and suicide girl might have been **long lost childhood friends** and suicide girl looked to to him for his art. Not much to go on yet, so this part could be all wrong."

Watch the OP and you see it briefly shows the glass girl in water then it switches to a scene showing the military girl surrounded by skulls and transforms into her being surrounded by flowers.  My current theory is that the glasses girl was either the guys sister or his creation and that she has a split personality/transformation ability that turned her into the military girl.  Alternately the sister died and was reincarnated as his creation following the usual you died and was reincarnated in another world trope.  Either way, she definitely recognized and reacted to him in the first episode.  Also, the military girl was talking about the power of eternal reincarnation \"Dust to life. Life to ashes\".  \n\n\nAs for the episodes itself, I like it, but was hoping for more interaction/reaction from the created and their creations.  The ideas of characters coming to life from fictional work is not completely new, but first time I think anime has touched it.   It is an honestly interesting thought experiment, anybody know any books like this?  I remember reading one years ago about a town where fictional characters go to die when their popularity ends, there is also a lovecraft movie based on it.  Thinking about some of the characters/gods/monsters from fictional work that could end up in our world would both be amazing and horrifying.   "

With her death, Himegimi somehow gained the power of the creators and was able to cross over to our world, learning the truth in the process.  In episode 1 you can see she erases Celestia's mech with [the same effect](http://i.imgur.com/R2ls0Lv.jpg) Sota has when he switches worlds.  Also she is able to teleport with [that same effect.](http://i.imgur.com/Y1tUaKg.jpg)\n\nNow she is trying to gather other fantasy characters to lead a revolt to punish and steal the creators power.  And you know what? I can't really blame her.  To us it's just entertainment, but to the characters their worlds are likely hell, full of suffering.  It's looking like there's going to be a civil war between characters that want to punish the creators and those who don't."

Imagine meeting them and finding out. Like Selesia's creator said I imagine it would be a little scary knowing someone you made up in a drawing or story has become real.\n\nSo so far we have a fantasy series (Meteora), a mecha series (Selesia) and a magical girl series (Mamika). I wonder what else we'll get. It'd be pretty bad (but hilarious) if a slice of life character showed up.\n\nIt's time for a magical girl transformation!\n\nWait is Selesia's creator voiced by the same guy who did Kamina?\n\nI love that Mamika is surprised her powers have caused such destruction. In her anime her attacks probably only do damage to villains.\n\nWe have another villain by the name of Yuya as the final character to show up in this episode.

I can understand putting an information dump in this episode as opposed to the first one to hook in viewers, but all the same it could have been much better.\n\nThe conflict with the magical girl, Mamika, seemed awfully contrived, but the consequences of her actions in a more realistic setting proved entertaining. I hope the show doesn't try to make differing ideologies the basis for its conflict as Fate/zero did, because the writing simply doesn't seem good enough to sustain that.\n\nAs of yet the protagonist continues to feel unnecessary, I wish more anime would skip out on bland male leads. That being said he's likely the creator of the the antagonist shown in the first episode, and there's plenty of time to develop him.\n\nI'm curious to see how far the series will go with its meta. The most obvious question is whether creators have retroactive control of their creations, and given how unlikable the first author seems to be I expect the answer to be no. All the same it's going to be interesting to see how the characters continue to react to being cultural products of our world. But unfortunately as of yet it doesn't seem like the anime intends to pursue the that obvious metaphorical topic suggested by its premise: the feedback cycle of how the art we create shapes our world.\n\nI expect this show will continue to be entertaining, but I don't have especially high hopes at the moment."

So Saitama doesn't do jack shit. And even if he was somehow able to hit him, Deux Ex literally can reverse casuality such that it never happened. Plus 120% of infinity makes no sense, because infinite is simply infinite.\n\nDeux Ex has fought against beings who literally are omnipotent, we are talking about literal gods who exists across multiple universes and who treat causality like a play thing. You also gotta remember Deux Ex can summon multiple incarnations of itself for any given situation. So he can summon a \"anti-Saitama\" and \"anti-Medaka\" Deux Ex incarnations that can counter their powers exactly if need be (not that he needs it, b/c his base self can take them on easily). \n\nThe stuff that Medaka do while impressive, is basically what you expect from a reality warper, which again Deux Ex has experience battling against so . He literally fights people just like her, but on a mutli-universe scale and he stomps them everytime. Medaka would likely go insane if she attempted to copy his powers, since his powers are fueled by metaphysical  Lovecraftian elder god magic that would turn any human insane. The only reason Deux Ex's pilot managed to pilot the thing, was because he was an elder god himself. Besides, Medaka's powers only apply at a universal scale, so Demonbane can simply move to another universe, and use his time-space powers to kill her from another universe ."

You're already analyzing too deep in other shows where more simple reasons are vectors for actions. You're not taking it as the characters see it but as how you see it. Papika in Flip Flappers doesn't see this left or right psyche, or the mind control device. She simply sees someone she instantly hates and attacks. Impulsively yes, which is my point.\n\n> the reason was absolutely ridiculous.\n\n\\>your opinion\n\nTo expand on the reason:  \nThe magical girl is a kid, in the literal sense of the word. She's in the real world and she says she's not going to forgive her creator for making her world a place in which people suffer no matter what. The lead in question to that worldview is what would happen if she met her creator? After all, he is technically the source of all the evil in her world, if she defeats this ultimate evil she'll have completely won as the magical girl.  \nCelestia agrees that authors writing about people suffering is difficult to accept, but she'll decide on her own what kind of person her \"god\" is instead of outright condemning him before even meeting him.  \nThe magical girl cannot reconcile this with her world view and attacks Celestia because she isn't on board with her plan, which is in fact the plan of the Military-Uniformed Princess of exacting punishment/revolution upon the Gods she talks about in the first episode. This is a reminder that the Military-Uniformed Princess also attacked Celestia, so when this kid shows up with the same worldview there's some animosity already.\n\nI hope that clears things up for you on the reason why this fight happens."
