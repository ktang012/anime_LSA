One of them being that of finding happiness.\n\nAlso, the music. The theme \"Always in My Heart\" is just so good. We have the lighthearted fun version, the soothing acapella humming version, and a fucking VIOLA (probably) version. Can the OST just release already?\n\nIn terms of adaptation, episodes 7&8 covered mostly events from chapters 1 and 2 of Vol.3, with some slight changes in the order of things, but didn't change anything major in the grand scheme of things. The pacing is definitely much better, though I am worried now they will only adapt up to the end of Vol.3.\n\nOn a side note, the [lore&spoiler document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpJFH2Z6xoOc48FqWH3zNiP7E_31edhtPRcpzhikbgs/edit) is now mostly complete, I still plan on writing a section or 2 of my own thoughts and discussions.
