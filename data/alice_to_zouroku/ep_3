All other powers we've seen are the manifestations of a desire for a single thing that has already existed.\n\nInstead, Sana and Hatori actually create/have mastery over one half of existence/reality. Hatori can create the \"soul\" -- artificial personalities, memories, emotions that inhabit the \"material\". Sana can create the \"material\", \"matter' or the \"body\" -- anything physical she can dream of, she can bring into existence. But she cannot control the mind, the memories, the \"soul\" like Hatori can.\n\nReading into the esoteric imagery from the classic Alice & Wonderland story, Sana and Hatori's powers together seem to make up the \"dual\" nature of life and existence. The Body and the Soul, the Spiritual and the Material. One who has complete mastery of one cannot have mastery over the other -- they are equally god over one half of the human experience. Even inside Sana's physical \"Wonderland\" she's never been able to control the thoughts or emotions of those who enter it. Only their physical experience."

Hard to tell, but well, I think the reason lies in her personality, that's just a thing, that's totally impossible to imagine for her. Human or not, she's still a little girl. \nThat (knowing / Imagination to control people) changed in the last episodes possibly, but now it's a cruel thing for her, something, she would never do to anyone, then whatever Sana is, she's actually very kindhearted."

   "text": "Beyond redeemable? She's a 9 year old kid who, despite having lived with Sanae and Zoroku for a while now (not very long tho), has had minimal contact with other people and still hasn't grown accustomed to basic human interactions. You can't expect a 9 year old who has pretty much been cooped in a laboratory her whole life to act like a grown up and be mature, that's just absurd and unreasonable. She doesn't even understand her own emotions for crying out loud so all she can do is describe them as \"I feel frazzled\".\n\nNow, on to the part where I **really** disagree with you. You say Sana is beyond redeemable, yet defend Hatori and act like she's done no wrong in the same paragraph. Maybe because you sympathize with her more than Sana?\n Hatori is **much** worse than Sana. I wouldn't say I think Hatori is beyond redeemable like you did with Sana (her situation is regrettable), but I certainly find it hard to sympathize with her. Hatori ran around and abused her powers to do bad things due to what essentially boils down to mommy and daddy issues, and it caused an adverse effect on everyone besides Sana. Everyone just froze up for Sana and she was all alone, scared and had no idea what was going on. When Sana first encountered the two amongst all the \"zombie\" people Hatori treated Sana with **hostility** upon seeing she was unaffected by her powers, and Hatori even pushed Sana down despite Hatori being the one at fault. \n\nYou say Sana hasn't listened to what Ayu and Hatori have to say, but she DID listen to what Ayu had to say in **this very episode**. Were you even paying attention? Also, when Hatori is in front of Sana while she's in the box she says \"I have nothing to say to you\" and then tries to victimize herself by saying \"You don't know anything\". So, as of right now, Hatori hasn't even TRIED to explain herself to Sana. Hatori even admitted last episode (or the episode before that, can't remember) that the whole situation must have been VERY scary for Sana and she admitted this episode that the things she's done is bad, and yet she STILL treats Sana with dismissal and hostility. Oh and Ayu apologized, but Hatori HAS NOT apologized. She said \"And I will apologize\". There's a difference between apologizing and saying you're **going to** apologize. With all this taken into consideration, Sana's animosity towards Hatori isn't just understandable...it's **justified**.\n\nYou just seem very biased against Sana without taking Hatori's attitude towards Sana or her own actions into account. \n\nStill, it's an opinion thing. You're entitled to your opinion, even though I wholly and completely disagree with it and cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can think the way you do."
