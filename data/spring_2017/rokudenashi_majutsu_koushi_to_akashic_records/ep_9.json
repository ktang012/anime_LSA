The series finale, though, was seen as largely undoing all of that, and left many viewers feeling like it was a betrayal of the themes and characterizations of earlier episodes. The backlash has been so severe that the final episode\u2019s scriptwriter has deleted his Twitter account and removed Kuma Miko from his resumes listed on Facebook and Wikipedia."

Those types of things i can get used to and still enjoy to a certain extent, there's honestly not that much of it in seikatsu, but i watched the first five minutes of Youjo Shenki, and put it down. I tried and i felt bad because i was so turned off by it. I thought, \"Why can i not appreciate this?\" and i eventually came to the decision that it doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. The war doesn't seem to be taken seriously, so the dark aesthetic doesn't match what's happening on screen, but the biggest problem i noticed is that the characters have these huge bright eyes in the darkest night. One of the characters looks like mei from overwatch but with a backlight behind both of her eyes. Honestly. It'll distract me the whole way through.

Showing skin is a big deal in Mahouka, the uniform specifically covers up skin everywhere. Other than meeting that requirement, ofcourse it will be designed to look... cool, interesting, whatever. It is a prudish setting, it's more extreme than real Japan in this regard, basically.\n\n>If you had mages practicing you would think practical comfortable uniforms would be the more obvious choice\n\nLike jumpsuits? Obviously it's still a world where they hold similar japanese values and traditions, like they still wear kendo outfit in kendo club. Men having different uniforms from women, etc.\n\nPractical, comfortable uniforms being \"obvious choice\" for practicing mages - i don't know if I agree with that. In most universes mages don't do much physical exertion, they wear robes and shit - not necessarily most practical. Most of them require to just study shit and read books, then stand still and cast spells.  \n\nAlso Japan cares much about appearances  - they care about the image of their schools and students represent them. Well a cool, elegant uniform is one way of doing that.\n\nSo i don't think the uniforms are unreasonable within the setting at all. They can be easily justified, imo. "

   "text": "This show has been surprisingly great. I started it last night due to stress from all the shit going on this week thanks to college because I thought it would cheer me up, despite thinking that it would be generic and probably shitty. Well, I was right about the first part, it did in fact lift my spirits. However, it has far from been shitty. It has, while at times being mildly generic, been really good so far and is definitely up there with the other best shows this season for me. \n\n\nGlenn could definitely make or break the show, and so far he has been done very well. Also, Rumia and Sistine are definitely being handled very competently in spite of sharing some common characteristics to other characters in harem-battle anime. Sistine is just the perfect balance of being Tsun toward Glenn without feeling overbearing, and also dere just enough to be believable. It also helps that Glenn gave her a reason to dislike him initially, and has gradually shown why he was recommended by Celica for the teaching position.\n\nMeanwhile, Rumia has a really interesting backstory that I am excited to learn more about. Obviously, Glenn would seem to be the one who rescued her, now it's just a matter of the show revealing that to her. I cannot wait to see how she finds out.\n\nI'm loving this show so much. :D"
