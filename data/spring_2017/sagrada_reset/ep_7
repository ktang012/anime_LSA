When Misore asked about what will happen to their relationship if she couldn't reset, Kei answered, \"I don't know.\" I expected him to answer \"It won't change\", but he didn't. He chose to be honest, no matter what the cost. He isn't sure himself about what he feels about Misore, and she accepts that. Their relationship is based on complete trust in each other, and to do so, they need to have to be completely honest with each other too. I got a little bit teary over that for some reason.\n\nThe fact that their relationship is so unhealthy makes me unsure how to feel about then though."

The messing with the chronological go-through of dates kinda confused me and I don't really know if there's a specific reason for that yet, but I'll take it for now.  \n(What I mean is that it's technically this way: 1 > 2 > 5 > 3 > 4 > 6 > 7 )  \nFor me it also had quite the uptrend in terms of enjoyment up until episode, with 5 being a bit weaker than its predecessor, but still giving in quite the information.\n\nMy only rather big problem with the show as is so far, is that it's dialogue is really, really ~~plain~~ dull and it feels rather boring in those scenes. It's probably the most common complain for the show currently, but it's also the most obvious thing.\n\nIt kind of disappoints me, (thus being the biggest disappointment for me this season, but that's probably because my expectations were sky-rocketing because of the theme) but also intrigues me as to where it will go with the whole scenario of these multiple-layered Abilities.  \n\nI'm definitely gonna be continuing with this, let alone for Madman Kei (Ep4).

We know that she doesn't steal abilities so we can assume that everyone has the potential to use any ability, they just have to know how to trigger/control it. So you just need a set of conditions to use any ability. People are not born with an ability, they discover how to use one (some don't like the class rep girl), so I think if you really tried you could discover the set of rules to trigger an ability and reproduce it."
