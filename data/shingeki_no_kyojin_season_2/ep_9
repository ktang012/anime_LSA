Recall that in Episode 1 the soliders are just dicking around because no one has seen a titan for year, decades maybe ( unsure of the exact timeline). So the assumption is that since they eat humans, but haven't had humans to eat, they don't actually need to eat to survive, otherwise they would have all died out. We also never see them eat animals, such as horses. That's why it was a shock to that guy (name escapes me) to see Beast Titan grab his horse. "

Well, most of us don't, at least.\n\nOf those three shows Gigguk parodied, I'd say Re Zero is my favourite. Really great show on its own, but you might appreciate it more if you have seen a few more 'Isekai', i.e. 'Transported to Another world (almost always with an RPG-like setting)' series, since it puts a twist on that premise. Though again, perfectly watchable on its own and I don't really have all that great of an anime library to recommend in that genre (I could give you a plethora of light novels though).\n\nIf you liked Re:Zero, you might also like [Steins;Gate](https://myanimelist.net/anime/9253/Steins_Gate), from the same studio (White Fox). It's a slow burn at first, but the payoff of sticking with it is absolutely worth it. Don't worry if you're a bit confused at first, pretty much everyone was while watching it. I won't tell you why you would enjoy it if you liked Re:Zero, because that'd be somewhat of a spoiler, but even if you didn't like Re:Zero, Steins;Gate is always worth a watch, it's not the 5th best rated anime on myanimelist.net for nothing.\n\nAnother great anime that you may like if you liked Re:Zero is [Konosuba](https://myanimelist.net/anime/30831/Kono_Subarashii_Sekai_ni_Shukufuku_wo), which is also a novel twist on the 'Isekai' genre, but with a more comedic tone. I'm, not sure how hit or miss the humor would be with you though, it's entirely possible that you'd have to see more anime to get the anime-ish jokes.\n\nAs for [SAO (Sword Art Online)](https://myanimelist.net/anime/11757/Sword_Art_Online), it's one of the most controversial anime in existence, with people absolutely hating it, and other people absolutely loving it. Try not to have too many preconceived notions about the series, it might ruin it for you. I personally thought the series was fun, but by no means a masterpiece. Especially the first story arc, which encompasses the first 12 or so episodes were pretty fun and even most haters sort of liked that arc.\n\nOnce you've seen SAO, no matter if you liked it or not, have a look at the [SAO Abridged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6kJKxvbgZ0&list=PLuAOJfsMefuej06Q3n4QrSSC7qYjQ-FlU) series. It's probably my most favourite abridged series of anything ever and tells its own story inside the framework provided by the original show.\n\nIf you liked SAO, or if you liked SAO's setting inside a video game, but not the way the show handled it, you can watch [Log Horizon](https://myanimelist.net/anime/17265/Log_Horizon), which made use of that setting a bit more than SAO did. The second season is not as good as the first, but if you liked the first season I'd watch it regardless.\n\nTokyo Ghoul is a mixed bag. While somewhat entertaining, I can't really say that I'd actively recommend it. Apparently the manga is better, but I didn't read it, so I couldn't say. Especially the second season (root A) is somewhat of a mess.\n\nFor something completely out of left field, I'd suggest [Clannad](https://myanimelist.net/anime/2167/Clannad), and its more infamous second season Clannad After Story. It's a real tearjerker and the first anime romance series I watched. The art style takes some getting used to, especially because of the bug eyes of the female characters, but you'll probably get used to it in a couple of episodes. The first season is a rather standard high school anime romcom, but the second season really elevates the show to another level, so even if you didn't like the first season, I'd suggest to stick with it!\n\nSince you're in the Attack On Titan discussion thread I'm guessing you like AoT? In that case you may or may not like [Kabaneri of the Iron fortress](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28623/Koutetsujou_no_Kabaneri) or [Seraph of the End](https://myanimelist.net/anime/26243/Owari_no_Seraph), both by the same studio (Studio WIT) that brought us Attack on Titan, with a somewhat similar premise, though I personally didn't like either of the series too much. Kabaneri is getting a second season next year, much to the dismay to any Attack on Titan fans, but if you liked it you have that to look forward to.\n\nThis might be the longest comment I've ever written, hope this is enough to get you started! I'd recommend to set up an account on https://myanimelist.net to keep track of what you've watched. That way, people can see what you've seen and what you liked, and make recommendations based on that. Also check out /r/animesuggest, a subreddit completely dedicated to recommend anime, manga and light novels!"

That said I will *definitely* return to it, as I have a bad habit of not watching more than 1 episode to evaluate a show, which is pretty bad as there aren't really any shows I can think of that caught on to me immediately. \n\nSteins;Gate is definitely something i'll watch at one point. On the list it goes!\n\nAnd *wow* I'll definitely check out Clannad, I was instantly sold on the fact that it's a romance anime. Sometimes romance stuff just hits *perfectly* with me, and I just can't stop consuming whatever it is (book, series, whatever) but only on some occasions, it's weird actually.\n\nIf for whatever reason you're interested in what I've actually watched so far, here's a list in order of watched (first to last):  \n\n* Avatar(I know it doesn't technically count)\n* Death Note\n* Madoka Magica\n* Attack on Titan\n\nOnly after getting caught on AoT was I like \"wow there might actually be something to this anime thing\".\n\nAgain, thanks for this comment!

   "text": "Well, Death Note is pretty cool :)\n\n> it is a bit weird how there's so much focus on boobs n butts. Is that a trope?\n\nYeah, a lot of anime have a weird focus on stuff like this, colloquially known as 'Fan Service' in the community. Some shows sometimes degrade to basically softcore porn. As to why that is? The problem is that the old phrase 'Sex Sells' applies here. Anime is a rather niche product for a niche audience, even (or rather especially) in Japan. So the content creators cater to the Japanese Otaku, which sometimes leads to stuff like this. This is also the reason Blu-Ray releases in Japan are so damn expensive, since that's the only way they can recuperate their losses with such a niche audience.\n\nThankfully, there are also a lot of decent anime out there that don't rely on T&A to appeal to its audience. In the case of Konosuba, some episodes are worse than others, afaik it was a different director for some of those episodes, but don't quote me on that.\n\n>I have a bad habit of not watching more than 1 episode to evaluate a show, which is pretty bad as there aren't really any shows I can think of that caught on to me immediately. \n\nIn anime circles we usually adhere to the '3 episode rule', where you watch 3 episodes and then decide to drop it or not. Which is usually a good rule to follow, but sometimes falls flat in cases where the series gets a lot better afterwards (Example: Steins;Gate) or in cases where it's pretty clear the rest of the show isn't for you (Example: Hand Shakers, DO NOT WATCH. Or do, just to laugh how bad it is). I personally also have a problem to just not watch past the 1st or 2nd episode in some cases :)\n\n>Avatar(I know it doesn't technically count)\n\nYeah I know some people that get really pissy about this, but honestly, it doesn't really matter. Avatar is a show that would appeal to most anime watchers, it's not that important if we classify it as anime or not. Beware though, some people can get really militant when it comes to the definition of anime, even though there is not real Definition that would satisfy everyone.\n\n> Madoka Magica\n\nInteresting show for a beginner honestly, did you like it?\n\nI thought about another series that's great to watch: [Fullmetal Alchemist](https://myanimelist.net/anime/121/Fullmetal_Alchemist) and its remake [Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood](https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood). I somehow always assume everyone has watched it already. This was the first anime I watched (outside of Pokemon, Digimon, Yu-Gi-Oh! and Naruto) and got me hooked on the medium. It's probably the most well-rounded anime there is, appealing to a wide variety of people.\n\nThese two series are both standalone pieces, with Fullmetal Alchemist being the first series to be produced. The series is based off a manga with the same title, however, at some point the anime overtook the manga (which, at the time was still being written) and started diverging from the manga and created an alternative story line. However, that storyline is still quite good, even though some Manga purists may disagree. A couple years later, after the manga was finished, the series was remade as \"Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood\". It started at the beginning again, so you could watch it without watching Fullmetal Alchemist beforehand, however it does rush the parts it has in common with the first anime. Brotherhood follows the manga to its completion.\n\nI'd recommend starting with the original Fullmetal Alchemist, then afterwards go with Brotherhood. You can then maybe skip the first say 10-15 episodes of Brotherhood, since they were already mostly covered in the original anime."

But the Armored titan attacked wall Maria when Reiner would be like 12 years old? Or maybe people who can transform into Titans dont age?\n\nFuck this anime keeps giving me so many questions."

If it turned out to be a red herring at this point it would totally smash my suspension of disbelief in this whole story. ...but then what the hell was going on in this episode?\")\n\n[SPECULATION](/s \"So firstly, that scene at the door where Ernie almost got killed. Was he really going to let himself get eaten for the sake of not 'blowing his cover'? The same goes for both of them at the top of the tower later on... Would they have transformed if push came to shove and Ymir just beat them to it? New theory; for some reason they now don't remember being shifters in the first place. That would maybe explain why we haven't seen either of them do anything titan-ey for a while?\")\n\n[SPECULATION](/s \"And then there was Ernie and Ymir's scene with the canned food. What was the significance of that? Is the food labelled in Titan language? I assumed that the previous occupant of the castle was Doctor Zaius, and that he's targeting the group there partly to try and cover his tracks but... Did he really bring packed crates of canned food with him? Where did the cans even come from if he did!? Titans operate a cannery now? Why can't Ernie read the titan language if he IS a titan? How did Ernie know the significance of being able to read the titan language if he ISN'T a titan? Why do Bert an Ernie have a flashback of being attacked by and losing a friend to a titan if they are fucking titans!?\")\n\n[SPECULATION](/s \"I'd previously speculated that there might be multiple Titan 'factions' and that Annie might not be directly in league with Doctor Zaius due to Zaius not recognising the manoeuvre gear. So I had Annie, Bert and Ernie, the humans and then Doctor Zaius's flying titan circus as a third player. But where the fuck does that leave Ymir? So she's not with ABE and she's not revealed herself to throw in with the Humans so far, but she's now fighting against Zaius? Are there THREE shifter factions now!?\")\n\nTL;DR - Eeeeh?"

If it ends up being true in the end, there's gonna need to be lots of explaining to do for any of it to make sense for the reasons you mentioned.\n\n[SPECULATION](/s \"It would also be kind of absurd if nearly half the characters from the original squad also happened to be titans. You can only pull off the \"this kid happens to be a titan\" card so many times before it gets really old. Eren? OK. Annie? Alright. Ymir? Yeah, it's been a while. But after the fifth \"this dude you've been following since the beginning was actually a titan!\" you'd expect the author to use another trick. I hope the series gets a bit smarter than that.\")\n\n[SPECULATION](/s \"I feel like the \"there are several titan factions fighting to control the world\" still makes sense, though. I think Reiner and Bertold might still be the Armored / Colossal titan and that they're part of a faction that might be Annie's faction, although that's unlikely, judging how Annie attacked Reiner in season one. What if after that incident from their childhood we saw in the flashback, they were abducted by a faction of scientists who know how to turn humans into titans the same way Eren's father did with Eren? What if that faction wants to bring the church down at any cost by using artificially created titans? And then, as children, Reiner and Bertold were told that they had to help that faction in its efforts to destroy the church and the entrenched humans, and that if they didn't do it, the scientist faction would kill their families? Notice Reiner's obsession with \"going back home\" and whatnot. I mean, if I were a kid who got injected titan juices and who was told to destroy a wall or two / infiltrate the humans if I wanted to see my family alive again, I'd probably do it too.\")"

   "text": "Good music. \n\nSome king goofed up hundreds of years ago and that's why they have titans now. \n\n* Satan gave an evil peach to some lady.\n* This resulted in her becoming a titan, or in titans being created? \n   * This bit, with the devil being there and all leads me to believe they're going biblical and referencing the nephilim.\n* Not sure about that first image of the soldiers attacking the large, titan like woman in the ocean. At first I thought maybe she was the person the kids were eating but then they'd have to be titans too. Unless she was a transformer too? I guess maybe the king's soldiers found out about the giant people, and tried to copy the same power for themselves, but wound up unleashing Titans on the world. \n  * Why'd he make his kids do the ritual?\n  * It looks like the kids are eating 3 hearts. There's one body shown. Where did the other hearts come from? Did they eat their own hearts out? \n  * Why does the corpse on the table have hair and clothes but no legs or skin?\n      * Did the soldiers from before catch a [ningyo?](http://yokai.com/ningyo/)\n  * Oldest two kids crying, youngest one seems weirdly OK with it? \n* The weird writing that pops up after that is the same writing that showed up on Ymir's can of beans (which also makes a cameo in the ED). So I guess the people in her group were scavenging for old canned goods in different ruins, translated the language from reading nutrition information, and wound up being able to translate texts about the  satanic ritual where the children eat the hearts.\n* The titan attacks seem almost retaliatory since they're coming out of the sea where the first big lady was.\n    * I hope the baby was saved. I have no idea what building they were running to. That the castle? Does that mean it was built to stand up to Titans? \n* People wandering the desert. More religious symbolism? Kinda reminds me of Moses and the boys after the whole Egypt thing.\n   * I would also like to know how those people made that long trip in that big group without getting trashed by titans the whole way. That's weird. \n* The titans coming out of the dirt makes it seems like corpses can animate into titans or something. I dunno. Or maybe it's actually spontaneous generation. Who knows. \n* I'm not sure about the card where the woman holding the flag is X'd out. She kind of reminds me of [Liberty Leading the People/goddess figure type paintings.](https://imgur.com/gallery/YcerOQO) The composition and the thing she's doing with her hands kind of remind me of [old-timey religious paintings where they throw catholic gang signs.](https://imgur.com/a/gRUjf)\n   * Knowing this show, the size difference between them is probably indicative of both their hierarchy and the fact that they're Titans.\n   * Is she like...holding a shofar? A horn or the apocalypse? What is that? \n   * Also interesting how there's a strong visual distinction between these giants (and the one at the beginning) and titans. These ones all look like normal, big beautiful people while the Titans are violent and derped out. So I think this kind of reinforces the idea of them being an experiment gone wrong. Aren, Ymir and Annie seem like examples of what it was \"supposed\" to be like.\n\nI have never correctly guessed any information in a show. "

   "text": "* About the King, I'm pretty sure he's forcing his children to eat the heart of animals or something. Note that the OP's name is \"Offer up your hearts\", and in the OP with the Beast Titan and the animals running, they all have that same glowing red part where the heart of animals should be. What's weird is, they don't die anywhere BUT the nape. So, why would the Beast Titan ALSO have that heart inside him? There's no brain, no intestines, or anything except for meat and bones inside titans.\n\nAlso, look at the mouth of the other priests in the King's scene: the king included, they all have red lips, meaning they ate a heart as well. And the children are crying, probably because they don't want to eat it, since a guy died in front of them to give them the heart. But then why do they all have a heart? It doesn't look like it was split up in 3, so where did they get the 2 other hearts?\n\n* I'll speculate that the heart protects them from Titans, like Armin did with the Santa Titan back in S1. Eren became a Titan from his Father's injection, so the heart can't be the thing that allows them to turn into Titans. So, maybe the kids are forced to eat the heart in order to be protected by the gods from being eaten, since gods have apparently something to do with the storyline (based on the beginning and ending on the ED, with the gods doing a deal with a Demon/Titan, and the gods being crossed at the end, marking the moments humanity gave up on gods).\n\nAlso, in one of the scenes with the Titans eating humans in the city, you can see the Beast Titan from afar, watching people getting eaten, BUT it was during the night (there's the moon behind). Means that the Beast Titan controlled a lot of titans for a long time ago.\n\n* The next scene is what bugs me. I have no idea whether the swarm of people walking toward the sunset are humans, or Titans. They don't look like either of them. Plus, the ED looks like it follows a storyline, starting from the gods to people migrating (probably to create the walls further away from Titans).\n\n* Now, before looking a the titans spawning out of nowhere, look at where the humans were migrating: towards the rising sun. But in the next shot, where the titans spawn, they aren't here, and buildings weren't made. Also, during that scene, the crow that was flying disappears before the Titans are seen laying on the ground. I think that the dead crows are what turns into some of the Titans, which could explain the difference of intelligence between titans (some titans are human, some aren't).\n\nWhat bothers me is that those Titans are born with height. In S2, it's clearly obvious that there are \"baby\" Titans, but do they stay babies forever? They grow up with time. So why does the Titans laying on the ground are already high?\n\n* Finally, on the last shot, there seems to be a detail that might be important. There's a small bit where you see the humans before seeing the Titans. I think it simply shows how humans are inferior to Titans, and the Titans are inferior to the goddess that made them (the one that appeared in the beginning and end of the ED, with the war horn.\n\nI have no idea what to conclude from all this, but based on what the comments manga readers says, most of what I said should be huge hints to the story. But I refuse to believe that the story would use such a weak excuse like \"It's God's will all along!\" to justify the presence of Titans, Which seems to be highly hinted at."

This is also the first ending that focuses on the Titans instead of the characters, but it is still cryptic enough that it leaves you with more questions than answers.\n\nWithout proper context, most of the pictures can only be speculated on. Most of the stuff seems like 'history' type of stuff that already got covered in the backstory of \"titans appeared 100 years ago, humanity got eaten\". \n\nThis is like finding the pieces that connect to a corner or border in a puzzle. You have narrowed the final image down, but you can't see it yet.\n\nHonestly, if not for all the \"wahh wahh spoiler\" talk, I would not have trusted the murals.

Like there's something pretty relevant to that religion and it goes back much farther than we give it credit for. I don't know too much of the backstory, or I've forgotten it since season one, but those images make it seem like titans have basically been a fact of life since the beginning of human history. \n\nAnd then from a purely stylistic view, it's fantastic. The music isn't overtly menacing but it's got enough of a weird tone to make it unsettling. I think it's quite well done."

That one of the murals represent a deal with the devil sort of thing. Perhaps humanity made some sort of deal for power, which ultimately resulted in them turning to mindless cannibal titans. What that deal is, I dunno but maybe Eren's father has something to do with it."

   "text": "Sure, but doing it in one big lump seems like you're begging for people to be turned off. SnK had 25ish episodes to develop the side characters and it is only now doing it really, in terms of the anime you are starting a new season with something which feels like filler half the time. Take Sasha's stuff, it felt very, loosely linked to the main plot in order to give us some backstory which we probably should have had 10 episodes ago.\n\nThe problem is not that the focus has switched - it's that the focus has switched suddenly at the start of a new season to characters that I don't have much reason to care about. They spent 25 episodes as side characters without being given their chance to shine, so now I start up season 2 to see what's going on and it's \"Look at these characters that were...around a few years ago. Remember them?\". To which my response is...kinda. I'm someone who didn't read the manga though I did rewatch the anime like a year ago, still as far as I can remember most of these characters had about as much development as the redshirts who die and I didn't care about them either. \n\nWe've had a rehash of a plotline from the first series (hell even the 'eren you can fix the hole in the wall' made me laugh), the titan villagers which is interesting but the fact that it's constantly told to me through characters that I don't care about kinda turns me off. The beast titan is whatever - another titan, it'll probably be a person or something, it's far more of a set up for future pay off than anything else. This was the first episode where things finally felt like they were moving forward and the next episode is going to be fucking flashbacks by the looks. Granted, of all the cast Ymir and Christa seem like they might actually have some relevance and interesting stuff going on so there's that.\n\nI don't care if they are following the manga precisely - I am telling you what my views are as someone who only watched the anime and is judging the show on that. Especially since this is the start of a new season, yet it really hasn't done too much to get me hooked or invested in the storylines. That feels like a problem which comes with the show starting a new arc, the first season of SnK ended with a bang and in the manga it'd make sense that it slows down after that and builds into a new arc. For an anime airing almost 2 years after the first ended the pacing feels off."

I get that it's been nearly 4 years since season 1 finished, but this is a continuation and an adaption of a manga, so they can't just make an anime-only story to have the start dedicated to the main trio. There's not much they can do about that.\n\nIt sounds to me like this isn't a series you enjoy? The previous season was way worse in terms of pacing and the improvement here is just massive. This chapter in the manga was actually my favourite one for quite a long time."

The lack of side characters with any depth was always a problem, you do not solve that problem by shoving how shallow they are in my face. I don't care about the manga, I am judging this as an anime series.\n\nThe previous season was at least obvious in how simple it was. It is, actually, exactly the reason I didn't start reading the manga. I heard about how convoluted it got and frankly AoT was never something I thought was actually very interesting as a show. It was entertaining, in the same way that Kabeneri was entertaining (until it jumped the shark) but not interesting really.\n\nThe fact that a lot of this is defense by manga readers feels pretty telling to me."

We know 100% that there was some long history with Titans due to the wall incident that shows that there are actual titans in the walls. The only reason for its existence means the ones in power had the ability to control titans to some extent. This episode in particular gave off a lot of information, one is that Ymir knows an ancient language that she shouldn't know, meaning she is not of commoner origin, and her preexisting knowledge of Krista is of major value, and the fact that she transformed as a last resort and made a promise with her proves it. Given that the priest who watch the walls knows of the wall titans, and that their mission is to keep close eye on Krista, this implies Krista is of major importance. With the hint this episode both the language on the can, as well as Krista's protective sacrifice attitude. I conclude that she is a form of royalty, and that Ymir is from a long lineage of knights that protected the royalty. Thus saying, I believe that that implies those  of near royalty or royalty itself have the potential to become titans like Ymir just did, which can 100% explain how titans were able to be concealed in the walls. If any one titan was sentient similar to sentient Eren, then creating walls is not a problem at all. Given high military authorities are in the black, I don't expect any of them if not many to have this ability. This then goes to the secret in Eren's basement, which I'm going to guess right now is the history and secrets of titans, and that the traumatic event in Eren's memory was his dad unlocking the secret and giving him titan powers, knowledge the commoners shouldn't have known about. Of course, the only thing I don't know 100% is what creates wild Titans, and if there is a larger figure fighting the wall system in spite of the royalty\")"

Being in that shit situation, there no way they'd all die, and it was impossible for Erins team to make it there on time. Blessed that it was Ymir though, at least she has some redeeming qualities about her. Also, it seems that she is the titan that killed the man that saved Reiner. Maybe she inherited that transformation/power somehow? But it seems like the same titan to me. Also that transformation was HYPE. Glad they didn't just leave us with a GIANT cliff hanger, just a small one. Also wondering if Christa knew about Ymir and her transformation. We'll find out soon!"

I'm thinking perhaps that might have been her mother ? She was the one to make that remark about titans mating to Connie.\n\nReiner... just wow! That's manly as fuck. But him being an obvious titan shifter/transformer undermines his courage a little, yet that scene where he had a flashback made me think he was actually going to die and not transform. \"Who does he think he is, always taking the most dangerous job?\"...\"Yea, that's a bad habit of his\" I like how maybe a parrallel between him and Eren was drawn - it's natural for them to take risks and they probably think they have to do something (even though Eren is just generally like that, regardless of titan powers). \n\nBack in the first season I thought the trio of collossal, Annie and that rhino dude(?) were actually trying to work in favour of humanity by getting them to break out of their shells - that's why they didn't just blast all the walls one after the other. I applaud their sanitiy/mentality if this is the case. But I got really confused when harambe got introduced - he reeks of malice. He and Annie/Ymir seem drastically different in their intentions and they likely belong to different titan factions ? It's also really weird that Reiner is scared from the titans when Annie was capable of calling them out to eat her, but that's probably because Annie was strong as fuck.\n\nEverybody is getting a titan form and I hope it doesn't turn into an all out titan vs titan war with humans being the prize, though a quick look at Mikasa and Levi's kill count and most non-autistic titans having a FFA sort of assures me it won't be the case."

When he talked with Ymir in that herring scene, he had a moment of realization and she turns into a titan soon after. He made it off as he didn't know how to read that language but he probably knows what it is, where it comes from. \n\nHe tried to throw himself out with the titan he was carrying, I know it was an incredibly tense moment, but he never tried to free himself from it's grasp, it's a bit weird so I have my suspicions. \n\nIn the flashback scene they were 3 people against 1 large titan with no horse, gear or weapons, in an open field - they are dead, I don't know from when is that memory, but unless some serious help came with horses they were done for, so he probably discovered he could become a titan in a similar fashion as Eren and saved himself."

There are (1) the ordinary humans living inside the walls, (2) the church of the walls and the wall titans (including Christa somehow), (3) the titan morpher faction that Annie, Reiner, and Bertholt belong to, (4) the Beast Titan and his posse, and (5) whatever faction Ymir belongs to.

Yes, I read what you said about them maybe coming here to look for spoilers... but switching from that to ask for the spoilers isn't risky for anyone, that's why I think it's better to not put the tagged spoilers, just because that, it's risky... there are a lot of risky things in life, yes, but putting spoilers (even tagged spoilers) isn't that necessary.\n\nI'm just looking at the possible outcome, not putting spoilers (even tagged spoilers) could lead to less people spoiled. And people who wants spoilers, could, by asking or looking for them, get those spoilers without risk to anybody. The other way, how it is now, is actually risky. This isn't about blaming anybody, it's just about trying to make sure that everybody get their best experience with the anime/show/movie/whatever by not getting spoiled (even if it's their fault as we can help it)."
