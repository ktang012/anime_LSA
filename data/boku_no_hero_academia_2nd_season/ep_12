One piece of advice: I think the issue with your manual stitch is that you took the lower screencap at the very beginning of the shot before she moved, so the torso didn't line up correctly (since she moved in between captures).  Sometimes it's unavoidable, but in this case I was able to get a clean stitch by advancing a few more frames until her hips settled before taking the lower screencap.  Other times, you might have to pay attention to a cycling animation (a common example is flowing hair or clothes) and make sure you take each capture during the same point in the animation.  Some are particularly fiddly, like [these](http://i.imgur.com/mi2T2ty.png) [stitches](http://i.imgur.com/lMuQQ0b.jpg) from Trinity Seven, but usually it's not too bad."

When new Naruto episodes were airing in 2003-2005, especially during the final Naruto/Sasuke showdown pre-timeskip, there was a massive amount of activity and discussion on forums and IRC. Bleach only ever really got close at the end of the Soul Society Arc, and while One Piece has a massive fanbase it didn't have quite the same enthusiasm as some early Naruto/Bleach did.\n\nMHA/AoT right now probably have the most episode-to-episode discussion/hype going since Code Geass R2."

The series has clearly acknowledged the issue with Bakugou's destructive and wild tendencies and he's been making progress as a person since he's been put into a field where his peers are his equals and a place where his heroism *is* being tested.\n\nI remain adamant that a bad person doesn't make a bad hero and the school knows this. There're already precedents in the BnHA universe for great Heroes being complete assholes."

Bakugou who isn't interested in what people think of him and just thinks about number 1, Todoroki who confidently knows hes number 1, and Izuku who is chasing the back of the other two. Its really interesting that Todoroki called Izuku out when Bakugou is more his level. Can't wait to see how the dynamic plays out."

All he's really seen of Bakugou in action so far is the training exercise in S1 where he just raged out of control while Izuku kept his cool. So, to him Bakugou is all talk while Izuku is a potential rival. That's likely to change soon though, now that Bakugou seems to have regained his focus."

I have a hunch that this Endeavour been shown in the OP, just without being named and will show up later.\n\nWhy was nobody questioning the lack of All-might in the teacher's area, while some scrawny dude with scraggly hair was there instead. Or is it public that he can transform. Does 1-A know about it? Since they made a deal out of the pressure coming from the audience, when everybody walked out, I assumed characters we know would look for people they knew in the audience, primarily the teachers. \n\n----\n\nSince this is a shounen battle tournament story arc, I have some predictions about the outcome, in case the chart of finalists indicate a 1v1 fight scheme.\n\nIzuku will probably make it to the finals, and will end up fighting either Kacchan, Todoroki, or the blue-haired dude. If not, Izuku meets Kacchan or Todoroki in the semi-finals and loses, while the finalist goes up against the blue-haired dude.\n\nThat loudmouthed B-class student will get knocked out in one punch, maybe by Kacchan or Todoroki."

And that is what i mean with progressing. There will be moments where he gets better in controlling his quirk and those moments are pretty well done (in my eyes).\nAlso the pacing of this show is good how it is, because this way they can already make season 3 and 4, maybe even a season 5 with how far the manga is. And it also feels like they can keep up the quality this high because of this pacing.\n\nAnd i am sorry if i sound arrogant or agressive, it's just hard to remember that ppl haven't read the manga sometimes. I can kind of understand why you are worried that this show might derail. But i can assure you that things will pick up from here. In fact in this episode you could see that Izuku made up his mind and is more determent then ever to \"catch up\" with the rest. You will see."

The latter is actually super similar to Deku in how they're non competitive and anti-conflict, but at least he wasn't a whiny/wimpy crybaby?

That expression conveys that even though Deku is nervous about what he is going to do against the robots (he really can't just use his quirk like the others) he is excited to take them on instead of being afraid like he used to be. \n\nI wouldn't really say either Eren or Mikado start out weak and become strong.
