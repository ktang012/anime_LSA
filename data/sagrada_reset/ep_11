That would almost seem to suggest that she REVERSES gravity, instead, but by only doing it to half of her body weight, she would just sort of float until such point as she provided a new force to accelerate herself upwards.\n\nAnd, of course, the verbal cue could be a complete red herring, completely unrelated to what her ability actually does, for the sake of deceiving Kei and Misora. And it's also possible that she was in communication with someone else who has the ability to make her fly, since she has bureau support.\n\nThat being said- what we actually KNOW:\n1. She has an ability powerful enough to be of interest to the Bureau.\n2. Misora's ability does not, in fact, reverse time itself, but rather resets all the matter in the universe to the state in which it existed at the savepoint.\n3.

I really liked Haruki's thoughts on Kei and how every time she resets he has to act his way through the events that already happened for him, he is very artifical.  It really show how wearing all this is on him.  \n\nWe also got another anomaly in the reset.  It make me wonder if something is causing this or if its just one of the aftereffects of the reset.  \n\nI really like this show.  I love time travel, i love dramas, and i love characters with good development.  They are addressing time travel really uniquely and its very interesting to me.  \n\nIde also like to note how it seems Haruki is saving now every 24h after a reset and they seem to reset often.  They are like well oiled machine now with how precise they get.  They even wait until the last second to reset back to maximize thier time.  I fully expect Kei to crack by the end of all this because this has to be mentally exhausting for him.  I guess we will wait and see.  \n\n[](#juice1)"

Haruki sees Kei and Sumire talking on the roof talking about her, sumire hugs Kei, haruki sees them and walks away (jealousy?). They convince Tsushima to allow the ability sharer to help with Mari. They convince Maris mother to take her back. \n\nSumire appears at Keis door and asks him to walk in the mountains, they talk at a bus stop, Sumire tells Kei that he loves Haruki. She asks Kei to see the sunset then says goodbye. \n\nHaruki (cut her hair) and Kei meet, and talk about Mari, they kiss, Kei says he doesn't feel happy, haruki says she doesn't know. Kei seems to not love her, saying let's only be together because our abilities can help people. Then asks her to reset to remove the kiss.\n\nAfter the reset, Sumire never appears at Keis door, nor is she at the bus stop. Sumire is found dead in the river. Haruki and Kei meet on the roof, Haruki wants to reset, but Kei stops her, as they already did and she died. \n\nSkip 2 years to highschool, they set up their club for their abilities.\n\nIn this episode, a new arc begins (Cat, Ghost and Revolution). they save a cat, but there is a larger conspiracy happening, and again something changes during the reset (Sumire's death and the ghost hand, as well as Mirai (the 'unknown club' member who talked to Kei about vampires) appearing over Keis bed.\n\n"

This episode was so much better and things seem to be rolling.  Misora is so much more adorable with her desire to get a red plaid miniskirt and her going meow at the end of sentences.  Wished Kei had a bit more energy to balance out his and Misora's dynamic."

The whole structure feels kinda like Monogatari series combined with Hyouka and Charlotte, maybe?\n\nThe overall impression is that Sagrada is a huge flop. Though there are some people that do indeed like it. Basically expect to get a mumbo jumbo dialogues carrying no sense nor meaning and a mildly amusing story if we ever get to that. Keeping your expectations low is probably the best thing you can do with Sagrada. And the animation (especially facial expressions) is pretty lackluster. Kinda weird considering how big of a hit Jojo franchise is."

But then this contradicts things that happen later.\n\nWhen she resets after Kei sliced his own wrist, it was healed. In this episode when she resets after the cat was hit by a car, it's alive again.
