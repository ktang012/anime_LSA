What happened is some more-powerful being dragged her out of her world and into another, with the stated goal of changing her world for the better. You can align with this being and have a chance to make your world/kingdom a better place, or you can stand against this being capable of dragging you into another world and her allies to gain... nothing. The other side isn't trying to modify stories and doesn't even have returning to their own worlds that high on the agenda.\n\nMeteora is the enemy, not an advisor. You're taking a viewer's point of view, where the show is framing Meteora as right. To an observer on Alice's side, Meteora sounds like Kim Jong Un claiming he's going to nuke the US. If they aren't putting concrete offers on the table there is nothing to be gained from listening to the enemy. Meteora still has nothing to offer, not even solid proof of Altair's goals. If you're going on the advisor track, that would be Mamika, but advisors are still only advisors. Every time Mamika asks her to stop fighting, she does not, because disengaging leaves openings. \n\nFinally, something that I really shouldn't have to bring up, loyalty matters. If Alice changed sides so easily, I wouldn't want anything to do with her. I can't give any detached, Vulcan logic explanation for why it is so important, but almost every relation relies on trust. Breaking agreements or shifting stances too easily does not make people look trustworthy, and it will come back to haunt them. If Alice is breaking her alliance, she NEEDS a very good reason."

Despite the fact that they were \"created\", it is entirely possible that their worlds are just as real as ours.\n\nThough, at the same time, if that's true it brings in a whole slew of more complicated questions like: If I wrote a story, does that story then become its own universe where I therefore am their god? Since the authors obviously have ultimate control over their creations.\n\nBut the fact that Sota, among others, were able to go to those worlds kind of proves the multiverse theory, that in an infinite universe there are an infinite number of possibilities and worlds, some of which may have been created by authors. Sort of like the whole quantum mechanics concept of it doesn't exist until seen."

Why? It wouldn't make any sense unless there's some seriously dangerous or grievous situation behind the creation of Altair and the ultimate fate of Sawako. \n\nThen there's the confrontation between him and Mamika at the end of the episode, and the fact that Fatman discovered Altrair's origin on his own. All that put together forms a very complex web that we can't make judgments on quite yet. Comments calling him a pussy and hiding his info are, I feel, jumping to conclusions.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, within the next couple of episodes Sota's probably going to be smacked silly by Selesia for hiding the information that he had already found. Also, keep in mind that's only been *one day* since Sota discovered Altair's origins, and during the course of that day shit hit the fan; he simply hasn't been able to come to terms with his feelings regarding his creation that wants to destroy the universe in conjunction with finding out that Sawako, probably his best friend, killed herself. \n\nAll of those circumstances, no matter who you are, can cause individuals to behave irrationally. It's happened to me with friends committing suicide and my mother dying. These things aren't as cut and dry as everyone wants them to be. Humans are complicated creatures, and should be treated as such. It's not matter of self-esteem, or even self-pity. It's just a teenager trying to come to terms with the fact that he may well have led all of this into existence with a few texts. Everyone here is just jumping too quickly to classify him as a cheap plot device, when the rest of the show hasn't had anything of the sort. \n\nBasically, Sota isn't hiding the information to prolong the show. He's just acting like any teenager would given the circumstances, and I feel like a lot of the people complaining about him aren't teenagers at all but rather adults who would put aside their feelings for the \"greater good\". That's not how adolescents act, but maybe it's been too long for some of us to remember how we would have dealt with the situation."

The problem with that lies within the crux of what Altair is trying to do: Any action these Creations take tears away at the fabric of the universe, and therefore the more action that is taken the worse the situation becomes. Of course, action is ultimately inevitable, but the \"heroes\" side is aiming for as little interference as possible. It's a valid reason for not having a lot of action, even if it can come across as slightly boring (personally, I don't think so; I think it's a great plot contrivance). If it was constant talky action, not only would their worlds be torn apart, but the very fabric of the universe is at stake here. I find it to be a very interesting, unique way of dealing with a *Fate*-esque circumstance. Hell, even in the Fate series there isn't as much fighting as people think they remember; it was a VN so there's a *lot* of exposition thrown at you constantly with few fights in-between."

Meteora is literally a librarian NPC at the end of a video game. *The only role she has* is to explain the final boss to the hero in the game. She's not from any anime or manga. She barely even has any dialogue in the game itself.

There, resolved.\n\nFourth:\n>I have higher standards and I absolutely despise that type of protagonist because it's there just because people are lazy and incapable of writing a decent character and even as an observant type he is pretty bad compared to Kumiko from Hibike for example.  \n\nFirst of all, the show isn't even complete yet so we don't know what kind of character Sota will turn out to be. Judging a character without full knowledge of their character arc is just rash. You might think you can see through anime tropes and stereotypical anime characters/protags/narrators/observers/whatever within a minute, but...well..\n\n....Your \"higher standards\" exampled was *Hibike! Euphonium*. You could've picked *Tatami Galaxy* or *The Eccentric Family* or even *Kyousou Giga*. Hell, you could've went with *Hyouka* if you wanted to use a KyoAni show. But you went with probably the most yuri-baited Kyoto Animation show there is, which the show spent more time on than what it was *actually* about. The plot of competing in the Wind Ensemble contests was so far in the background I doubt half the the people who watched it even remember it was the *actual plot* and instead got angry because two girls didn't kiss. \n\nThat's not \"higher standards\", that's just..Man, I'm not even going to go there. I was actually expecting something better till that popped up, and then my brain fried.\n\nFifth\n>You understand that almost nothing of importance happened in 7 episodes. A little spat here and there to show some animation and 0 advance in the plot, SNK did this too, Re:Zero didn't and Fate/Zero didn't as well. Fate/Zero had Tokiomi and Kiritsugu doing stuff and making actual plans, Re:Zero had Subaru understand even more things about RbD and the personalities of some characters while we only had two meaningful scenes in episode 6 and 7. Just 2 scenes where we've got some character development.\n\nI'll give you Re:Zero as its premise demands Subaru come to grips with his situation, and it in fact ends with the scene where Else goes nuts. However your interpretation of Fate/ZERO is wrong: Yes, there's strategy, but so has Creators. The big difference is that ZERO was a prequel, and the Holy Grail War had already been established and we knew what would happen to pretty much every character.\n\nAs a matter of fact, I just went back and went through all first 8 episodes of Fate/ZERO. Tokiomi and Kiritsugu's \"plan making\" consists of them drinking wine, talking to Gilgamesh, and polishing guns. For two-three episodes while all the other Masters and Servants are introduced; and still nothing happens. You know how many fights there are? Three. How many fights have there been in Re:Creators? Three. And if you think we've only had two episodes of character development in Re:Creators, you're again way off base.\n\nIt's simply becoming more and more apparent you just don't like the show, so why bother watching and complaining? That doesn't make sense to me; just drop it. I'm not trying to convince you to watch it, I'm merely pointing out your arguments are either strawmen or just poorly thought out.\n\nWhich leads me to the Sixth:\n>And what is this \"if you haven complained about other shows then you're a hypocrite\" bullshit. I don't even know why I bothered replying when you can't even defend your own opinion on this show without assuming that I haven't actual criticized other shows that fancy you. It doesn't make sense and it's plainly retarded. How does me criticizing other shows make any difference here? Does me saying anything about Fate/Zero, Re:Zero or SnK change anything about my claims? No it doesn't it's just bull shit that you're trying to shove in my face just so you can have an argument.\n\nThis is what we call a \"Strawman\". I used those shows as comparisons because, aside from Re:Zero, they are very similar in pacing and character development. If you can't see why, or how, I have no way of convincing you otherwise as your mind has already molded into concrete with no way to convince you one way or the other. \n\nAnd, yes, it absolutely is hypocritical if the pacing of one show that has identical pacing to another show doesn't bother you, but the latter's pacing does. In fact, that's the very definition of hypocrisy. It makes perfect sense, but your anger is clouding your judgment and causing you to make really simple mistakes. \n\nKeep in mind that you were the one that initiated insult throwing, whereas I have yet to say anything negative about your views other than calling out a hypocritical statement. Despite that, I'm perfectly relaxed discussing this because you don't seem to understand how arguments work in the first place (comparing things that can be related is a common tactic in argumentation to show that even if two things have a different shell, the innards can still be similar. e.g. Red Vines and Twizzlers).\n\nHowever, the fact you resorted to slander and misplaced frustration has pretty much ended any further communication we could have had, which is actually unfortunate. Instead of civil discourse you chose to resort to internet satire as your defense mechanism, which honestly fell out of style twenty years ago.\n\nSeriously though, just stop watching the show if it's causing you that much agony. It's just not worth it to force yourself to watch something you despise just because everyone else is. Though, I would try and watch it again once it's all out so you can binge watch it and see how it flows together instead of waiting every week and thereby feeling as if certain events are taking longer to get through than they actually are. In any case, good luck with those...\"higher standards\" of yours. Sorry, it still chafes me that *anyone* could consider *Hibike! Euphonium* among \"high standards\"."

   "text": "> Wow, you really hate this show. You should probably stop watching it.\n&nbsp;\n\nPlainly stupid, I don't hate the show it has flaws and I'm watching it because all other non-sequel shows are pure trash. Don't assume things when you can barely mumble some self defeating arguments.\n&nbsp;\n\n> Uh, what? Meteora is literally a librarian NPC at the end of a video game. The only role she has is to explain the final boss to the hero in the game. She's not from any anime or manga. She barely even has any dialogue in the game itself. I don't know where you got the idea she's from some show, but you're already way off base.\nThe fact that the only thing she can do is explain things is actually good character design. She's stayed true to how her Creator made her, like every other Creation. They can't just change their personalities, that's why Mamika is having such a rough time with everything.\n&nbsp;\n\nI know that she is from a game and it doesn't make any less of a difference if she was from a game or an anime or a book. She is a plot device, she has no other meaning in her existence other than being plot device. The fact that she was a librarian with 3 lines doesn't make her a good character it merely makes her bearable to watch. She could have emotions, she could do things on her own, she could do many other things that she conveniently doesn't because she is a plot device. \n&nbsp;\n\nHow can you even say they can't have changes in their personality when in the last episode that was literally the main motif of it. And even before that you can clearly see that some characters have undergone change and have different goals in mind.\n&nbsp;\n\n> 80% from his PoV? Not even close. More like 40%, if that. I didn't \"just call him a the [SIC] narrator\", nor was I making an argument for it. I was simply stating that Sota himself called himself not the main character, but rather more like the narrator in the first episode. Again, way off base.\n&nbsp;\n\nHe is always in touch and always reminded of things even if he didn't ask anyone for it nor have we seen anything that will makes us think he does, most of the times he even runs away from anything Creator related. We mainly had his POV until the episode where the military barges in, clearly he is the main character.\n&nbsp;\n\n> First of all, the show isn't even complete yet so we don't know what kind of character Sota will turn out to be. Judging a character without full knowledge of their character arc is just rash. You might think you can see through anime tropes and stereotypical anime characters/protags/narrators/observers/whatever within a minute, but...well..\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd how do you know he won't be the narrator for the next 15 episodes? How do you know he will be a good character? I judged him in according to what I can already see not with speculations. He did nothing, he is nothing.\n&nbsp;\n\n> ....Your \"higher standards\" exampled was Hibike! Euphonium. You could've picked Tatami Galaxy or The Eccentric Family or even Kyousou Giga.

I was actually expecting something better till that popped up, and then my brain fried.\n&nbsp;\n\nI used Hibike as an example because I don't expect someone who is telling me \"if you didn't like it why did you watch it\" and things like \"opinions are subjective\" to know any good title, I just put down the closest mainstream view of what people mean as a good title, and anyway even without that bull shit Kumiko is a decent example of an observant type protagonist something that Sota isn't yet. She reacts and acts differently towards different people and has different opinions about them as well even she mainly does nothing until the end. Sota barely has anything to say other than \"Huh\" or \"Eh\" and the only thing he actually did is tell them which character is from which show. He is just a LN protagonist, another cliche thrown in a full meta show that somehow manages to not be meta enough even with that.\n&nbsp;\n\n> I'll give you Re:Zero as its premise demands Subaru come to grips with his situation, and it in fact ends with the scene where Else goes nuts.

I didn't think I made a good argument on Fate/Zero either considering how similar they're but I haven't gone back to watch to see for sure, I'll give you that.\n&nbsp;\n\n> This is what we call a \"Strawman\".

Instead of civil discourse you chose to resort to internet satire as your defense mechanism, which honestly fell out of style twenty years ago.\n&nbsp;\n\nI thought people would have at least a small degree of decency when using congnitive definitions. Also about hypocrisy, don't you think it's hypocritical to call me a strawmen when from the start you're shoving shit like \"you're a hypocrite because you said nothing about x,y,z\" when we weren't talking about that, when it doesn't make any point about Re:Creators, when it's literally meaningless to discuss? How do you even consider the fact that I may or may have not criticized shows from years ago(2011 and 2016) when you know absolutely not a single thing about what I think or what I've said in that time.\n&nbsp;\n\nThis is redundant and pointless, it's completely retarded to even have an argument with someone that tries to read between the lines and overthink what people think or say just to make an argument when they could just stick to the matter at hand. I ignored your stupid strawmen in the first place, you beat me into it and now you're calling me a strawmen. People used to have more decency when writing wall of texts before, but I guess times change and some people lack even self respect."

   "text": "Good lord, man. Sorry for jumping to conclusions, then. That was my bad, and I apologize; that was wrong of me, clearly. Though you are being far too aggressive regarding this conversation, and also making assumptions that are also incorrect. \n\nSuch as:\n>How can you even say they can't have changes in their personality when in the last episode that was literally the main motif of it. And even before that you can clearly see that some characters have undergone change and have different goals in mind.  \n\nThe person undergoing the most change is Mamika due to the conflict she's having regarding the difference between her world and this world. She also has a defined character in her world, which allows her to be able to change. \n\nMeteora, on the other hand, has *none of that*. The fact that they *can't* change their own characters was *also* driven home in the second or third episode. All the Creations are different in various ways, and are they do not all follow the same rules; it's one of the major plot devices, and it's been repeated multiple times. A static NPC, for example, is not going to be as easily changed as a character who has been developed over years.\n\nNow, regarding Sota: You're giving him far too much credit as a character. In the 7 episodes released, he's almost always in the background doing nothing or not there at all for entire episodes. Yes, that means, as of now, he's literally nothing more than a stand-in. \n\nBut you know what? I've seen plenty of these types of characters in many different shows grow over time to be able to predict that he'll have much more of an impact in the future. Anime characters are incredibly unpredictable, even when you think they are. That's one of the major reason I even watch anime in the first place: to see worthless characters grow (i.e. Subaru from *Re:Zero* or Hachiman from *Oregairu* who's even *more* worthless than Sota).\n\n>I used Hibike as an example because I don't expect someone who is telling me \"if you didn't like it why did you watch it\" and things like \"opinions are subjective\" to know any good title\n\nNow you're just being dismissive for no reason other than you think I'm ridiculing you. Well, I technically was because you used *H!E* right after using the phrase \"higher standards\" which is just plain ludicrous. *H!E* isn't even a good, collective mainstream title, it's a yuri-bait KyoAni show that anime fanatics drool over for reasons beyond my own comprehension. \n\nAnd your usage of Kumiko as an observant protagonist isn't even accurate, in my opinion. She's just a straight up a generic yuri-bait protagonist. In fact, I'd say she's the complete opposite of the type of character Sota was designed as, and therefore not an accurate correlation. Both have completely different motives, desires, thoughts, genders, etc. They're not in any way similar and not a good example of the type of protagonist being described with Sota. A better example would have been Kyon from *Haruhi*, but you decided to go with a person that just isn't comparable. \n\nAnd again, we still don't know exactly what kind of character Sota is, yet. Yes, that makes it badly plotted out, but to dismiss the character entirely is just unfavorable bias towards a character trope you just seem to not like and a character that really hasn't done anything at all other than find out he was the one who created the villain and talked with Mamika; and *again* described himself as just an observer.\n\nAn observer character does not have to constantly have inner monologues. It is entirely within the realm of possibility that they are just that: someone who observes. Words are not necessary. Especially considering this is anime original and *not* a LN adaptation where inner monologues are rampant. In life, observers keep to themselves and that's exactly what Sota is doing and is therefore more akin to a living person than an anime character.\n\n> don't you think it's hypocritical to call me a strawmen when from the startyou're shoving shit like \"you're a hypocrite because you said nothing about x,y,z\" when we weren't talking about that, when it doesn't make any point about *Re:Creators*, when it's literally meaningless to discuss?\n\n\"Shoving shit\"? Never did I say \"you're a hypocrite because...\" I said that it comes across as hypocritical if you're complaining about aspects of a show that other, similar shows (i.e. Fate/ZERO) have in regards to some of the exact problems you're claiming *Re:Creators* has. Never did I \"shove shit\" into your face as you claim. Neither did I know your stances on those particular shows, so I claimed that that would come across as hypocritical. You took that way, way too far and much too personally; to the point that I may have hit a nerve you may not be aware of. \n\nBut the thing is, we *were* talking about those issues. You just took it too literally and too personally instead of looking at it from an objective viewpoint. You reacted as if I insulted a loved one, instead of remaining clear headed and pointing out possible errors in the argument. What I got instead was incomprehensible rage instead of discourse, and therein lies your strawman in addition to the new strawman you made making me into a virulent defier of your arguments, which I never even stepped into the realm of.\n\nYou're absolutely right that I have no right to criticize you on shows I know nothing of your opinion of on. That's why I didn't do that. All I did was make similarities between shows that share similar structures, never once making any claim of what your did or did not like concerning said shows. The only claim I made concerning your opinion was with *Re:Creators*, which was simply wrong of me in the first place; you just seemed extremely passionate about how terrible the characters were that anyone would probably make the same mistake of you not liking the show. And while I may have misjudged it, your attitude made it so.\n\nI don't agree this is redundant nor is it pointless. If it were, you wouldn't continue responding with such aggressiveness. As for reading between the lines or overthinking what you've said, isn't that the whole point of discourse? The matter at hand, by the way, was you complaining about the show being slow and having the right to criticize it. In that sense, I absolutely stuck to the matter at hand and explained in detail why it may not be such a good idea to criticize those issues right at the beginning of the first climax of a series, whether it be *Re:Creators*, or any show like it.\n\nAs for your random comment on \"the good old days where walls of text used to have decency\", I'm fairly sure I've been pretty considerate of everything discussed. If anything, you've been the one doing the attacking with every post. And that's all I'll say on that subject, because, honestly, I prefer civil discourse.\n\nEDIT: By the way, this:\n>I used Hibike as an example because I don't expect someone who is telling me \"if you didn't like it why did you watch it\" and things like \"opinions are subjective\" to know any good title\n\nIs pretty rude, crude, incredibly self-righteous, and exactly the type of responses you're claiming I'm making towards you. I apologized for jumping to conclusions for the two shows I did make assumptions of, so the least you could do is not lambaste someone by making the same mistake, only so much worse and virulent."

The added content sort of involves her escaping death with her new ability to float and about to exact revenge on the protagonist. \n\nI do find it pretty weird that this new segment is printed out despite it abrupt end (that 'tt' at the end). The author is obviously incapacitated at that point, so why did Magane even bother to print it out?"

After revisiting that scene, I'm pretty sure she doesn't want to cooperate with him. Also, someone else pointed out to me that he was about to say something like \"she really hates me\", which matches her first reaction to him."

He knew about Altair vaguely, but couldn't remember where he'd seen her (again, see ep5 or 6) and had to look the character up online and then was surprised once his suspicions were confirmed and saw Shimazaki's name listed as the author.\n\nIt also makes more sense that she was her creator: she hates the world, makes a character that hates world or simply has a story purpose to be a world ender (\"World Etude\" was the name of her last work), commits suicide to leave hated world, and then I guess Altair either simply inherits Shimazaki's wish for the world to end, or Altair is ending it because the world was \"so bad it caused my creator to take her own life, so I hate it all on my own for that, so I'll get revenge and destroy it\".\n\nAt most, I think he may have been involved in the character's artwork to some degree, or had simply seen it in passing since he's an artist himself and apparently friends with Shimazaki so she may have shown off her work to him some and he just didn't remember it well at first.\n\nI think that line of his in this episode where he started to say \"my\" but then changed his wording was just a bad translation, which is what led to the confusion. He doesn't actually say \"my\", he says \"boku\", which means \"I\" in a masculine sense, generally for boys rather than adult men.\n\nThe actual line, literally translated, was something like \"She, Altair, I...this world, (paraphrasing now) ...she really hates it\". In other words, it essentially went from \"She, Altair, really hates me\" to \"She, Altair, really hates this world\"."

I suppose it's because it was more dynamic than everyone sitting in a conference room hearing a presentation, but also much of the talk is what we've been waiting for for a while now.\n\nI'm liking Magane and Mamika more and more. I would've liked to see Mamika having more of a crisis facing the difference between her world and reality, but since that's not the direction anyone else has to go in, that wouldn't be fair to her. So instead she's getting development in a more likeable direction, and showing more agency and growth than anyone else so far. It's inevitable that she'd be the most likable character at this point. (So... death flag?) And she finally got Souta to reveal what he knows about Altair, mostly because she's the only one in a position to directly ask, since none of the rest had reason to believe he wouldn't have told them on his own.\n\nDisappointed in Souta for not telling his allies about Altair before telling Mamika about it, but ultimately it means that the other three Creators are relevant. I liked seeing that the normal humans are talking things out on their own and really trying to figure out how things work, and that not everything rests on Souta's willingness to disclose his traumas. No doubt there are some things only he knows, but the plot isn't stalled just because of his reluctance to speak, because the others are competent too. If Setsuna was listed as Altair's video's poster, that would give the government a line of inquiry to pursue, so maybe we'll finally get some answers."

I thought it was originally to stop them from using powers that could possibly upset the laws of physics of the real world, but that hasn't come up at all in the Military girl's group talks at all. Is it just because they agree with Altair, even though we know literally nothing about her motivations other than \"they are probably bad\". So then why are the knight and old man teaming up with Altair? What did she tell them?\n\nI'm just a little lost as to why they are having these battles other than just because. Someone please help me with this. "

   "text": "On the surface, Military Uniform Girl, AKA Altair,  is trying to use the power of the creators to fix their worlds.  That is what she is telling the creations to get them to side with her.  She has an alternate motivation though that is fueled by her relationship to the suicide girl, Shimazaki, and Sota.  It seems she wants to destroy all of the worlds.  Alice's world is horrible and she can't accept that someone would just make it for entertainment.  She will do anything to save her world.  Mamika, being a magical girl, has a naive sense of justice and believes she can convince the creators to fix all of the worlds.  She can't fathom that Altair could be tricking her because that's not how things work in magical girl shows.  Although she seems to be coming around now.  Blitz Talker seems to be loosely on Altair's side, it seems like he just wants to see what happens. \n\nOn the other side you have the humans and creations that want to better understand the phenomenon and get back to their worlds.  They've come to the conclusion that what Altair is doing could destroy all worlds and they want to stop her.  I think Sota is the only one that suspects that may be her true goal."

   "text": "I was a bit confused a few episode ago and had to go back to understand, it's kinda explained during the last 3rd of episode 4 around ~14:45 in. The knight woman comes from a hellish and brutal world that she wishes to save so she tried to get her creator to change it. She is also (rightfully) pissed off that her world that is full of struggles was created for someones entertainment. When her creator couldn't fix it or send her back Altair says that to uncover the secrets of this world that they need to break it down and shake up the status quo or nothing will change. Knight woman is willing to cling to any sort of hope to accomplish her goal of saving her world.\n\nAlso during the meeting with the government I think Metora said that Altair needs to gather a large amount of creations to stage an attack all at once because if she half asses it then the entire plan will fail, so that's why they were trying to recruit crazy joker girl last episode.  \n\nBut for the old guy I don't think he is on anybody's side just yet, he just seems interested in what Altair is trying to accomplish. I may have missed something with him though. "
