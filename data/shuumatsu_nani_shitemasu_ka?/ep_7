Even 4 volumes is way too much for this amount of screen time.\n\nMany good LN adaptations were good precisely because they did not try to cram too much of the source material into insufficient number of episodes. For example:  \nSpice and Wolf 1 - 12 episodes, adapted vol 1 & 2 of the LN.  \nSpice and Wolf 2 - 12 episodes, adapted vol 3 & 5 of the LN, vol 4 was skipped.  \nFate/Zero - 25 episodes were used to adapt 4 volumes of the LN.  \nHataraku Maou-sama - 13 episodes, adapted LN vol 1 & 2.  \nHai to Gensou no Grimgar - 12 episodes, adapted LN vol 1 & 2.  \nOverlord - 13 episodes, adapted LN vol 1, 2 and vol 3 with some omissions.  \nRokka no Yuusha - 12 episodes, adapted first volume of the LN.\n\nThere is a lot more content in light novels then you usually see in their adaptations. Generally speaking, 12 episodes per 2 volumes is good, 12 episodes per 3 volumes is still somewhat tolerable. Anythings more, and we get very bare bones adaptation.\n\n*Shuumatsu Nani Shitemasu ka?* anime has already adapted volumes 1-2 (3 episodes per volume) and with current pace will reach volume 4.  \nThey are omitting *a lot*. The anime is good not because everything is done right, but rather because the original is pretty damn great."

This makes me really want to know more about it, dig into discussion board or wikia page. Ones may enjoy as it is since it is already good enough.\n\nEP 1-3 are great with enough world-building information, pacing, and impression. EP4 is just an OK for me. I don't really like EP 5 because their story is random.\n\nAnyway, comparing to other LN adaptions. Some of them just introduce whatever they want out of nowhere and never mention anything before. I personally dislike Re:Zero because of this issue even though it baths a ton of praise. Yeah, I agree it's a good show to watch but it's not that great.

Faries, trolls?? And with who exactly was the humanity at war with? The beasts and everyone other race? Or where the beasts the thing that ended the war with the destruction of the surface and humanity.\n\nAnyways, I agree with you , there is simply not enough time to give it that much focus without starting to be lacking in other areas. My guess most of these is answered in the LN.\n\nNow since you mentioned books with rich setting and if you don't mind an epic undertaking (totally worth it), I would recommend some of Wildbows online novels (they are FREE, donations possible). As a plus they are also English so nothing is lost in translations as is so often the case with Japanese LN.\n\nThe serials feature some of the best written characters, character interactions and world building I have ever read (I read a lot). Simply said the quality of the writing is professional and makes for a very addicting read. Having read a lot of fantasy books the serials just feel very refreshing.\n\nAlso fitting in with the theme of child super weapons he has a great biopunk fantasy named Twig. Here is the main [page.](https://twigserial.wordpress.com/about/)\n\nI apologize for straying away from the topic, but I just could not resist the temptation."

I mean, at least it looked prettier and did not try to cram all three routes into itself, but still it  made all the same mistakes and felt like an afterthought in terms of scriptwriting and directing effort.\n\nits actually kind of mind boggling for me that two entirely different studios can make two entirely different adaptations  of same source material YEARS apart and still make the exact same writing problems(removal and misunderstanding of main character's characterization, altered or downgraded characterization of multiple characters, lack of crucial lore information, bad and uneven pacing, weak narrative presentation that involves lots of uninspired shots of talking heads, fights altered to fit the studio's vision rather than to convey their actual meaning, etc, etc).\n\nIts kind of hilarious too - DEEN is making Konosuba and Rakugo - top shows of the year. Meanwhile Ufotable made....God Eater and Zestiria? Makes me worried for HF.  Its already suffering from not having the adaptations of two previous routes to build upon and since it is just few movies and not a show, it is bound to have things cut here and there. At least I  hope they get the tone right(since they messed that up HEAVILY with UBW) this time and fights look decent. \n\nIt kind of makes me wonder - in ten years or so when another studio hopefully gets a shot at FSN adaptation - what kind of studio could pull it off? SHAFT is on the table due to their methodical and brilliant adaptations of Monogatari(another monologue and dialogue heavy show), but otherwise which studio is careful and stable enough to adapt this work without falling into the same pitfalls as ufotable and deen.

When he wasn't the one handling the episodes, UBW turned out fine (look at how the glorious ep. 20 was handled in terms of direction for example compared to certain poorly handled eps from both cours, especially from the first).\n\nWhile I don't agree with you that the new UBW anime was as horrible in terms of writing and direction as the first adaptation was (and I don't think KonoSuba is even worthy of being called a top show in terms of adaptation either imo), I do agree that it did suffer from some bad flaws here and there in setting up the right atmosphere and tone (the lack of monologues from the first cour was something I hated when it first aired). I guess it all falls on the right director i guess.\n\nYou can be hopeful for the HF adaptation though. I heard that Tomonori Sudou is a Sakura fanboy, so he'll probably put loads of skill and effort into directing this unlike Miura, the guy who directed Ufo's UBW."

Ufo even boasted before the start of series how this series works great as sort of training for \"fresh\" people. \n\nIts sad to think about it that way for me, but it really felt like nobody really cared about that adaptation.\n\n> When he wasn't the one handling the episodes, UBW turned out fine (look at how the glorious ep. 20 was handled in terms of direction for example compared to certain poorly handled eps from both cours, especially from the first).\n\nEhhh, since I did not like Ep20([UBW Ep20] (/s \"It was still poorly directed talking and while the episode TRIED to portray the meaning of it, it still felt lackluster and way too shonen-y instead of inspiring and meaningful. The cringy jrock at the end instead of Emiya OST still hurts my brain too\")) I gotta disagree. The only truly great episodes were the the prologue - perfect pacing, perfect cinematography, even if some lore was removed. Everything else ranged from \"ehhh decent\" to \"what are they even thinking?!\"\n\nAnd even if he is not directing or storyboarding an episode he is still in charge of all the decisions and choices in the story. \n\n> You can be hopeful for the HF adaptation though.\n\nIts a three-movie adaptation of the game's longest route, most of which is talking. A route that REQUIRES and builds upon the other two routes. \n\nAt best we will get some decent action but I am not hopeful for everything else. \n\n>  I heard that Tomonori Sudou is a Sakura fanboy, \n\nSakura is easily my top hated FSN character and weakest part of the route so *shrug*. Now if you said the director was Illya fanboy or Rin fanboy or Shirou fanboy I would be hyped beyond belief for it. \n\n[HF spoiler](/s \"As long as they get Rin owning her ass with the jewel sword right and animate the Nine Bullet Revolver well, I will have gotten everything I expected from the movies.\")"

Since beasts couldn't fly, destroying the footing will halt the attack.\")\n\n**Souwong's last conversation, clarification from anime**\n\nthe anime's presentation may led to some to believe that he may have something to do with the beast, but that's not the case\n\n[ ](/s \" the line in the LN was along the lines of\")\n\n[ ](/s \"Souwong, with his knowledge and experience, can easily manipulate Willem to work with him. However, since Souwong used to look up to Willem as a big brother, he couldn't bring himself to manipulate Willem.\")\n\n***\n\nOh my god that opening scene where Ctholly tried to say \"I'm back\" to Willem's door was BRILLIANT, and it wasn't even in the LN\n\nI'm kinda sad that they cut out Souwong's description of Willem, but their interaction was still awesome nonetheless\n\nI love the difference between the Souwong that was Willem's little brother, contrasted with Souwong, the great sage. \n\nThe exchange between Souwong, who wanted to take back the land, and Willem, whom only wanted to protect the fairies, was one of my favourite conversations in the novel.\n\n > \"I always thought you were a bit more of a heroic brave.\"\n\n > \"I did too.\"\n\nCtholly's scenes were perfect, that's all I can say.\n\nAlso, pay close attention to Ithea's last line.\n\nHere concludes the events of book 2. I really hoped that they would've paced a bit differently here, since the feels train was mostly focused into this episode, while the previous 2 episodes were rather... lacking. Regardless, I enjoyed them. At this pace I'm suspecting we will have adaptation to book4, with book5 potentially being OVA?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnyways, here are some notable differences&exposition details between LN and anime from episodes 4-6, aside from dialougue cuts\n\n***\n\nRegarding 'Adult Fairies'\n\n[ ](/s \"What the sub referred to as 'adult fairies' should probably be translated as 'mature fairies'. In the official site, the Carillon users have the designation of \u6210\u4f53\u5996\u7cbe\u5175 (mature fairy soldier) with a grade from B-S attatched, while the younger kids have the designation of \u5e7c\u4f53\u5996\u7cbe (child/infant fairy).\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRegarding \"Mental Disintergation\"\n\n[ ](/s \"Or 'Erosion'. The cyclops doctor actually had a brief line explaining it. \")\n\n[quote from LN](/s \"They (the fairies) are without exception all reincarnated beings, or rather, they are the souls of the dead themselves. Before they reached their current form, they were someone else. If the those memories were to remain or be recalled, it will cause severe negative effects to their current personality and physical body.\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWillem's Flash Step\n\n[ ](/s \"This technique is called \u9daf\u8d0a\u5d29\u75be, pronounced Ousanhoushitsu, practically untranslatable chain of kanji. Essentially, this is a movement technique that allows the user to 'fall forward', hence does not require any pre-motion such as bending legs/building power etc. It is said to even be able to fool the eyes of the Elves. And as a side note, there are no more elves left.\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe slap\n\n[ ](/s \"The slap actually happened in the LN, despite the fan translation suggesting otherwise.\")\n[Original text](/s \" \u97f3\u9ad8\u304f\u3001\u30f4\u30a3\u30ec\u30e0\u306e\u9830\uff08\u307b\u304a\uff09\u304c\u9cf4\u308b\")\n[Rough TL](/s \"loudly, willem's cheeks rang. implying a slap\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLimeskin conversation\n\n[ ](/s \"Conversations with limeskin are probably the most difficult to adapt. But the main difference here is that limeskin actually directly ordered Ctholly to take care of the issue at hand\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnnhilation Knights sub-plot\n\n[ ](/s \"This is the biggest change. In the novel, after a brief demonstration of strength by Willem to disarm one of the 'knights', he negotiated with their leader. Using their safety as a bargaining chip, he convinced the annhilation knights to sell out their sponsor. Demonstrating Willem's tactical abilities.\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nCtholly and Willem scene\n\n[ ](/s \"This was actually broken into 2 parts. First Willem saying that he has a home to return to, which makes him happy, this was actually before the annhilation knights came up.\") \n[ ](/s \"the second part was ctholly's confession. Ctholly actually observed that, during the negotiation with annhilation knights, Willem poised himself in such a way that he can take them all out within 3 seconds. which lead into ctholly saying that they have taken over Willem's fight, and she had been watching him closely because she was in love.\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\nSouwong's Description of Willem's Power\n\n[LN quote](/s \"He is truly a bewildering one. He had almost zero talent. His venenum flow was below average. He can't even evoke a basic thaumaturgy spell. Even in the way of the sword that he sought after, he was only able to learn the most common skills taught by the local schools.\")\n\n[ ](/s \"He was an ordinary person. But, he aspired to be a regal-brave. Despite the countless times he was faced with the harsh reality of his own lack of talent, he never gave up.\")\n\n[ ](/s \"To make up for his lack in abilities, he stopped at nothing to learn everything he could. As for the techniques he was able to learn, he relentelssly sharpened them. In the end, only with those basic techniques of his, he was able to achieve great victories, more so than most everyone else.\")\n\n[ ](/s \"Back then I was young and my powers immature, but still in terms of capability I outclassed him by miles. But, even now, that I have obtained far greater power compared to then, I am still incapable of imagining myself emerging victorious if I am to fight him.\")\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n***\n\nHere is my WIP (yes it has been wip for like a month already...) **lore&spoiler** [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpJFH2Z6xoOc48FqWH3zNiP7E_31edhtPRcpzhikbgs/edit?usp=sharing) for those interested to know more about the world of sukasuka(link to fan translation in document). I've also enabled comments, i think, so few free to ask questions/comment in there."

But the moment she attains happiness and the future she longs for, she would lose her right to wield Senioris and, thus, the power to protect Willem and make him happy. So she keeps her mouth shut and doesn't say anything, and goes on the defeat the god Elk and save the world so that Willem would no longer have to fight and could return home to be happy. But ultimately, Lillia fell into a coma following the fight with Elk, Willem still ended up fighting and even being \"killed\" by Ebon Candle, and the world still ended up being destroyed.

   "text": "Geeze todays ep was great.  One of my big draws to this show is the mystery of 500 years ago and i love the way they keep giving us bits of info as the story goes on, and we slowly uncover what happened.  Today we got a lot more in that regard.  \n\nIt was also really cool to see someone else from 500 years ago gang is still alive.  Like Willem's main plight is that he has no one who can truely understand his situation.  People know hes 500 years old now and that he seems to have vast knowledge of the swords and fought for justice in the past, but like they dont really understand him.  Souwong was there in the past, he knows Willem very well and spent a lot of time with him, so he is probably the only person in this world who really understand Willem, as noted by him cutting thier conversation short to save Willem some greif because he could tell he was overwhelmed.  Its also interesting that the big bad that Willem fought to the death is on the good side now.  Im suprised Willem doesnt hold any animosity towards Eboncandle.  \n\nIs Souwong from Willem's orphanage or was he from elsewhere?  He said he looked at Willem like an older brother, so that made me wonder if he was with them and buttercake-chan.  \n\nI really like where thigns have gone and seem to be going.  I cant wait to learn more about things.  I wonder how much this season will adapt of the novels?  Anyone have any speculation?  Im unfamiliar of how many volumes the novels are or how many the show is adapting but someone said todays ep ended volume 2?  so we will see maybe 4 volumes covered or no?  How long is this show?  \n\n[](#juice1)"

They're supposed to be memories of her past life, but a lot of those things are definitely not normal happenings like the 7 eye'd frog.\n\nThe series has this weird tendency to introduce huge problems and then solve them immediately though. The beast came back this episode, and despite how hard it was to kill last time Kutori just charged it and now it's dead. Alongside that, she woke up pretty easily despite her mind deteriorating.\n\nSomething that made me think though is the lifespan problem that Suowong brought up.

Ctholly ends up waking up not remembering anything other than the fact the guy falling through the sky was important to her, so she takes Nofts dug weapon and jumps off the ship to save willem, when willem and nephren land they get thrown around violently and are so fucked up they cant move and they end up surrounded by 100s of timeres, just when the situation looks bad ctholly lands and annihilates all of the timere surrounding them but ends up tearing her body to shreds basically and she falls into a coma for the final time, and thats where volume 3 ends\")\n\nIts not letting me properly paste the text from the LN of what I just said here in spoiler tags so if you want it I can pm it to you"

Basically, he's given her a back massage, sparred with her, and told her she's an idiot for thinking she has to die.\n\nSo now she loves him? I just, don't get it. This needed more build up for me. And it's not just a little crush or anything, it's full-blown \"I MUST RETURN TO HIM\" in her battles.\n\nThey keep throwing these manipulative crying/hugging scenes at us, but they're not earned. I understand why Willem might get emotional, since he has baggage from 500 years in the past, but Chtholly's crying at the end of this episode didn't really make that much sense, especially with the wailing that accompanied it. I got the sense that she didn't understand exactly what happened to her. The appropriate reaction was confusion, not wailing crying. I suppose she is a little girl though, so I can't really expect too much maturity from her.\n\nAnd that's the next problem. Between cat ears girl's constant refrain of explaining how much Willem must really love little girls, and Nephren randomly just sitting on his lap and clinging to him last episode... is this supposed to be a harem, or a romance, or both? I don't get it. A romance with harem benefits perhaps? That all just feels like light novel trash. I mean, the male-to-female ratio in this show has been completely broken from the start, but at least at first it felt like Willem was just a caretaker to these girls who were in trouble. Now the older ones are all his groupies, even if Chtholly is the main love interest for some reason I, again, don't fully understand.\n\nAnd now they're rushing the shit out of the lore with Willem's 500-year-old friends popping up out of nowhere, miraculously still being alive. They're only here to drop a bunch of exposition. We learn nothing more about Willem's character from them.\n\nEverything about the last two episodes has just felt rushed, haphazard, and disconnected. My emotional reactions don't match up with what it feels like the director is trying to evoke. I just don't buy what they're selling I guess."
