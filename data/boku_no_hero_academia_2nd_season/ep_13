Especially with the 2-cour confirmation earlier. [MHA spoilers](/s \"Full Cowl looks like it'll get done justice\")\n\n- Not feeling the OP as of yet but there's plenty of time to grow on me. I like the ED tho.\n\n- Can't wait to see more from the rest of class 1-A. This lovable group will finally get their well-deserved spotlight. In fact, they already have more screentime than all of S1 combined. And with a tournament no less; bring on the creative Quirks and fights!\n\n- I'll excuse the amount of flashbacks since this is the S2 premiere. There was some savage roasting in this episode. [My](http://i.imgur.com/nAc4OU6.jpg) [Savage](http://i.imgur.com/Fy1juLc.jpg) [Academia](http://i.imgur.com/1uXvc1B.jpg).\n\n- I don't remember seeing the school so populated in the manga.

The TV execs must have asked Bones to create for a dedicated recap episode. \n\nProblem is, the true S2 Episode 1 will have been storyboarded an age ago...perhaps during S1's run/production cycle.

What shocked me the most this episode that I didn't realize I missed so much was the class dynamic. It's so fun to watch everyone. Then there's Uraraka.\n\nI am so happy to finally see this animated my goodness. We learn about her motives which are noble, and tiny Ochako with the shirt that says super! Iida is amazing as always with his over eccentricity.\nPast that, All Might has lost even more time, which puts the pressure on Deku, and makes me more hyped to see what our madman will come up with this time to say **I AM HERE**.\n\nSo *bravo* BONES, **BAVO**.

Also hoping that we can see a bit more of All Might's predecessor. It would be really interesting to get the backstory of how All Might came under his wing."

It's going to be a sort of nostalgia trip back to the Chuunin exam arc in Naruto. I'm not a big fan of the big action Shounen stories, but I love duel and sports arcs where each character uses their skills in clever ways\n* It's fun to see a kind-hearted character like Ochako have such a shallow reason for being a Hero\n* I want class Prez to be my life coach. He seems like he'll support anything\n* Ah, she does have some motives behind it. I don't know what I expected.\n* Seeing the massive all might with that small dainty lunch box is adorable.\n* I hope the series doesn't take too long to get to the sports festival arc, and that when it gets there it doesn't get interrupted by villians too much (which it probably will).\n* ED sucks. Just a mediocre song with some pictures.\n\nQuite a slow first episode of the new season, but I hope it picks up soon.

Just why?\n\nThe other big problems were the comedy and direction during the the middle parts (classroom and hallways scenes). They were really over the top. I don't know why but they had a bunch of weird exaggerated gestures with strange sound effects. Just watch Lida for a good example of this. It was really distracting. I get that the animation was technically good, but it felt out of place. Movement should have purpose and fit the character/scene.\n\nAnd the comedy boiled down to a lot of yelling. I get it, it's shonen. There's going to be yelling, but it was done way too much this time around.\n\nI'm still excited for the show, but man, what a strangely bad first episode."

Also, the long-awaited animated gameface of Ochako in the big screen.\n\nSpeaking which, does the animation make a massive difference in the episode's end, seriously. Never was so hyped in my life watching Toshinori tell Izuku what his wishes were for him in this Sports Festival.\n\nBoy, these next weekends will be a hoot with this, and Little Witch Academia the next day.

The rest of the class finally gets screentime so the episode is automatically good. ALSO MISS MIDNIGHT IS BEST GIRL\n\nNow the manga moves really fast in terms of the timeline so hopefully they don't put too much fluff into episodes as they did with this one, but it is the premier so I understand setting things up and the flashbacks. 10/10 to me this show will always be perfect so I'm biased."

I believe in the importance of recaps, but in comparison to Shingeki no Kyojin, where it took only about 3 minutes and then jumped straight into action, Boku no Hero Academia was very underwhelming. I'm looking forward for the next episodes."

   "text": "this show has so much fucking potential but it is wasted. everything just feels so cheesy and it's extremely disappointing. the execution is just terrible imho\n\nFrom the one red haired guy who's name no one remembers screaming something then being cut off with unnecessary dramatic music to Iida having an awkward walk-run animation just to tell the class something that they are already doing then afterwards being cliche embarrassed. They need to make the characters have more personality and little traits which overlap with each other and they could easily have done this is they had the students dorm at the school rather than staying at home. It would have forced the students in an environment in close proximity to each other to start their bonding and character development. Just even showing them lounging around in their downs seeing how they behave would suffice. It could show (without any words) what students study on their own time and which ones don't. It could show which ones choose to go to books or outdoor exercise/working out, or even going to other resources for information like the instructors. It could show SOOOO much about the characters in short little 30 second clips more than anything this show has done. [bnha](/s \"I know they go to dorms in chapter 98 according to google, but that is WAYYYYY to late\")\n\nEveryone is described by one main personality trait and no one actually feels human aside from several main characters. The author just throwing around dialogue lines to background characters WON'T make the audience remember them.\n\nThen the first freaking 10 minutes had LOADS of reused footage from S1. The recap was unnecessay when they already did an episode 0. \n\nPlus all the stupid monologues explaining obvious things. SHOW NOT TELL. oh wait, that would require tons of more budget, so they cheaped out and just rely on words rather than original animation. lul\n\nThey should have shown a more in-depth backstory for the reason why Ochako wants to be a hero instead of flat out stating why her main reason is in the beginning. Show first, have the audience think about it, then the very last thing would be to reveal it.\n\nThe best part of the episode was the All Might- Izuku interaction.\n\nThis WHOLE episode could have been episode 0, and not episode 1. \n\nI am tough on the shows I want to be great. There is so much stuff that could be optimized but they just don't do it. Anime just has terrible writing in general and it's depressing."

The beginning was solid but the whole villain thing in the end ruined it for me. one main problem is the villains don't seen evil enough. I would assume that villains wouldn't mind killing students and not just adults. Having some of the students being red shirts could really establish a darker tone for the future of the series and propel forward the major and minor cast's development on why they need to get stronger: to protect the ones they love and care about. Having 3 students watch the teachers brutal beat down wasn't enough to settle the fear into the students. i had an idea for deku to kill someone accidentally by using his quirk on a villain but he would throw a punch with his eyes closed since it was the first time he used it on a person intending to kill them. Nomu could have had a more sadistic personality and dragged the teacher into deku's punch killing the teacher. It would have traumatized deku and give him a huge obstacle to come over and it would have taught him to punch with his eyes open. A reminder that all these quirks are extremely dangerous and if not used in the right hands, will kill innocent people."
