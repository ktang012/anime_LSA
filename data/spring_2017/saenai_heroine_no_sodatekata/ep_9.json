Also significant is that Utaha had to go through Katou, her main rival, in order to inquire about Aki's progress concerning her second scenario.\n\n- Katou must have realized something after that conversation with Utaha, and suggests Aki actually make a trial version for Utaha's second scenario to force Aki to make a choice.\n\n- Michiru continues to be utterly useless when she's not playing the guitar. Even her bandmates ended up being more useful. Never change, Michiru. XD\n\n- Of Michiru's three icy-tail bandmates, I think my preference is Ranko (stoic, big boobs), Echika (has a boyfriend), and then Toki. Everyone guilt-tripping Echika into working with them was too funny upon discovering she has a boyfriend. lol\n\n- Eriri still too ruffled by Izumi's challenge that she's entered into a creative block. Will she recover enough in time for Winter Comiket?\n\n- **Post Credit Sequence, don't forget to watch this** And WTF Aki? You were given a choice and you chose to reject both?

At this point I don't think anyone stands a chance against the mighty Katou.\n\nAnyway so much content in this episode! As much as I hate Iori, he's still a nice person but with different beliefs from Tomoya. While I understand Izumi wants to go against Eriri and wants to get on her level, I don't get why she's so hostile against her. She was pretty finw with Eriri during the events of Episode 0. Even Iori has no idea what's up with his sister.\n\nNice to see Icy Tail back again! And it looks like they'll be taking on a bigger role than just being simple side characters. I feel like if the circle needs more grunt work they'll be under Michiru's beck and call, of course under Tomoya's request.\n\nAs for Eriri looks like she's currently in a slump. Possibly due to pressure on going against Izumi? And that post credits ending! I wasn't actually surprised with Tomoya's decision. He's the kind of person that values quality over everything, if he thinks the script is shit then it probably IS shit. I'm kinda scared how Utaha will take it though.\n"

   "text": "Both Utaha and Eriri's characters are trope heavy by design, intentionally done by the author as a foil for Katou's uniqueness.  However just because they are trope heavy doesn't mean they are badly written. What sets this show apart from many other harem / pseudo-harem shows is the attempt to humanize the girls despite the tropes, as we have seen from the current Utaha arc that she has her own motivation and vulnerability, same thing goes for Eriri's big fight with Tomoya last season and the creative block she is experiencing. That's why I enjoy watching all the girls interact even if Katou was my bias from the beginning."

And also alot of meta humor comes from her. So it's not that hard."

Kato basically has all but won now (including the previous casual conversation they always have, i.e. Aki-kun? Kato-kun mirroring they did on the train ride)."

And ofc Megumi ruins even that. Also Eriri's little jealousy is cute too.\n\nEdit: Actually scratch that. I think the second ending Utaha wrote hints toward a sequel game, which is indirect way of saying she still wants to make games together with Aki, and thus needs to actually be in town in order to do that.

This is almost the exact thing that happens in season 1, and I suspect the main reason is the same. He's chasing after Utaha (presumably because Utaha can't accept his indecisive ass, or she left on her own will). I'm just very afraid Utaha will leave the team after this. "
