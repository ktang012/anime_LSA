I think the show tried to start with a slow pacing in developing the characters, rushed a conflict to catch the audience with some kind of climax (it's still an action anime), and without time to do all of this, 13 turned out explaining everything in the end. He's a great character, it's just that he has too many holes to fill in this history that ended up uninspiring for me as a viewer.\n\nThere's still so many flaws into the story that I'm sure other people will point it out, in the end, a rate of 3 is the max I can give to this."

   "text": "[Akatsuki no Yona](https://myanimelist.net/anime/25013/Akatsuki_no_Yona) would be my first recommendation. The action is not the key of the show (expect conflicts but not much combat itself), but the history and drama push it up. The female protagonist goes to up and downs and her development is pretty good. Romance don't play a big deal too, but that's not mean it's bad, it spices the show a little. Great history (kept me to read the manga afterward until now).\n\nNext one would be [Fate/Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/10087/Fate_Zero). The action on this one is insane with great combat. On a fantasy side, it uses a Battle Royale kind of mode between historical characters. The plot is basically this: last man standing is rewarded greatly in the end.\n\nNot a popular one but [Rokka no Yuusha](https://myanimelist.net/anime/28497/Rokka_no_Yuusha). Great characters in a plot that focus on finding the betrayer between the six heroes. Fun battles (ladies are OP type of fantasy in a future decaying world) and interesting mystery. Good OP/EDs.\n\nLast but not least [Nanatsu no Taizai](https://myanimelist.net/anime/23755/Nanatsu_no_Taizai). A 24 ep shounen like anime. Great battles with great characters. I find it a generic shounen kind of plot (help the kingdom basically), but everything else make up for it. Very good OP/EDs.\n\nETC. if you have time to watch: FMA:B, Bleach, Akame ga Kill!"

   "text": "Ok, can u KYAKKA the magic now?\n\nNo, me and 13 need some time to prepare. Go fight bears meanwhile.\n\nOk, can you KYAKKA the magic now?\n\nNo, our boundless power isn't boundless enough. We need that kid whose magic is nowhere near our level for some reason. Play with the bears.\n\nOk, can you KYAKKA the magic now?\n\nNo, we need a sacrifice. Yo, hey?\n\nr u fucking kidding me?!\n\nThis turned up pretty bad. Disappointing, indeed. I expected better from this anime but I can tell what the biggest flaw of all was.\n\nThe author can't write \"other people\" at all.\n\nWe have the main cast. They are all pretty interesting. We have a super witch, a reverse-trap witch, a tsundere furball, an ojou-sama complex furball, and an imouto complex sorcerer. That's a pretty good main cast. Everybody with their motivations, backstory, twists and depth. Everything good.\n\nThen we have literally everyone else. They are fucking tools. Retards. They have the IQ of one of those arm flailing balloon dolls. Seriously. They do everything the plot wants them to do, and nothing else. Let's see some examples, shall we?\n\n1. Burning Sorena at stake, without benefit of doubt, just cause.\n2. Following 13th (him) BLINDLY for no good reason\n3. Magically (hehe) disappearing when defeated. This happened a couple of times, defeated baddies just vanish.\n4. Lacking whatever sort of thought. \"Holy shit look at all that magic aura the guys have. Let's throw some arrows at them!\"\n\nIt was hinted a number of times this part of the story was shit before, but we didn't notice. For example, the rogue witches just being bad. That's some incredible mobbing and generalization. There was no attempt to talking to them or anything, they just tried to eliminate them because they are \"bad.\" Conversely, the non-witches being all nuts to kill witches. The beastfallen being all nuts, too. The guards, assassins, sorcerers of zero just following orders.\n\nBasically, the anime had this main party of two, three, four, five characters being surrounded by not characters, but homogeneous factions. Any member of a faction represents the faction stereotypes. This is why every sorcerer of zero (save for one single old dude nicknamed CRAPPY DEUS EX MACHINA) is a misled idiot who only knows how to use magic missile. (what's the point of magic arrows anyway? just use normal arrows!)\n\nThe conclusion was what you'd expect if you figured the flaw of the anime before it ended, and not just in retrospect. The main party did a thing, every faction automatically got affected by it. Factions unanimously agreed on things that individuals would never accept. Sure it sounds easy to say that \"the empire hated witches because they were nuts, but the nutjob witches lost their power, and their gained the science of magic, so they are ok with witches now,\" but it's impossible to say \"John had his son, wife, and mother brutally murdered by witches, enraged, he swore his revenge and hunted them for long 8 years, never going one day without recalling the gruesome scene, or a night without dreaming hellish nightmares of the fact, but now he is ok with them and happy to begin his studies in the magic academy!\"\n\nAnother big problem, I think, was the magic itself.\n\nThe anime claims magic is dangerous and super powerful. But it doesn't fucking show any of that. In fact, the magic it does show look pretty stupid if you ask me.\n\nFirst we have magic missile (arrows) which are just like... normal arrows? These people are archers. I don't get the point of using magic for that.\n\nThen we have... magic missile (arrows). And magic missile. And then there's also magic missile. Jesus fuck it's magic missile all the way down! It's all these retards cast! LEARN SOME SPELLS DIPSHITS!!! LEVEL UP THAT CRAP. \n\nThen there's the fact that, before Zero's \"Mahou\" there was some even more crappy magic that relied on summoning demons. Who were... disturbingly weak. We don't know how strong the stuff is with a proper sacrifice, but I can't believe this stuff won against swords and actual arrows. It's just too far-fetched of an idea.\n\nWhich brings me to say: the action in this anime is shit. The swordfights are cool (go youhei!) but THIS ISNT AN ANIME ABOUT SWORDFIGHTING. ITS ABOUT MAGIC. The most magic fight there was was 0 and 13 staring at eachother in the good ol' beam-of-war, and Zero winning because she's a damn lying cheater.\n\nFor all the menace the anime said magic was, it turned out to be too passive and disappointing. As if the only reason it was said magic was dangerous was to say witches were dangerous and start this crappy witch-hunt at all.\n\nI enjoyed it, but it disappointed me and progressively lowered my expectations. 7/10."

[See list](https://myanimelist.net/animelist/odraencoded?status=2&order=4&tag=)\n\n>you basically saying to people there that this anime is good, which by your above logic writing clearly shows otherwise  \n>Even the good moments can't carry the disappointment of this.\n\nThe anime certainly isn't good. It's mediocre. It has a few points I enjoyed (a strong main cast, plenty of delivering unexpected jokes) despite being pretty shit in the long run. You could say I enjoyed the episodes, but hated badly written plot.\n\nThis is different from anime like Jormungand S2 and Robotic;Notes which I've rated 6 for failing to deliver anything at all. Or Kaiji S2 (rated 5), for being actually a game of pachinko disguised as an anime. Or Accel World (rated 3) and Captain Earth (rated 2) for being a disgrace.\n\nBasically, I think if I recommended this show to someone, they'd enjoy some of it.

   "text": "The last episode was not at all faithful to the LN. Nor particularly was the rest of the show.\n\nFor example, from what I gather, the anime makes it seem like the witches that tried to stop them from blocking magic in Wenias just instantly forgave Albus after the fact and followed her again. The LN introduces a system where only those with Albus' permission can use magic, and so she holds their loyalty through that fact, since they all want to be able to use magic again. They could have explained everything, including this, but instead just made the episode way longer by having the cast go around placing seals to set up for their big ritual. The scene in episode 2 where Zero explained how magic and sorcery worked was longer and more thorough too, but got cut short in the anime and left a lot of people confused. Same for the fight between Zero and Thirteenth, there was a lot of information missing that led people to think Thirteenth was the most inconsistent character ever they'd ever seen. Overall the anime added a ton of filler scenes that sometimes worked, but mostly sucked (e.g. the village scene in episode 3), and took up the space of actual **context** and **explanation** that should have been there **to help people understand what the hell was going on.** \n\nThere's a million examples of how cramming filler into a pretty good LN to anime adaptation and marginalizing the actual exposition will destroy the adaptation in terms of quality.\n\nSorry about the rant, by the way, but it sucked to see all that potential ruined."

Albus is treated more as a serious character and less as a third wheel, Holdem is given the role of comic relief after his more despicable acts backfire, Zero teases Mercenary a lot more, and Mercenary's flashbacks never happen. A lot of that was just lost in the anime.\n\nI have to agree that it was annoying to see people get confused towards stuff that was properly explained in the light novel. It seemed like the show's director didn't really give a shit about the source material."

The kingdom must be super small for them to cover its entire breadth and width in an afternoon.\n\nOverall, 6/10. The first few episodes were the best when we were still being introduced to the world and its magic and backstory, but sadly the anime never built on that. Instead, it simply continued fast and loose with what was going on, motivations, character arcs aside from Mercenary and Zero...\n\nAll of it felt like the focus was on those two and damn the rest of it. Ending was too easy and the coexistence of witches and humanity after that huge battle at the end was entirely unrealistic.\n\nI doubt there will ever be another season, but I would still watch one since it seems the focus is going back to the duo on a journey through the world, which is what drew me to the anime in the first place. Plus, surely the story can only get better from the rock bottom that is the plot in this arc."

   "text": "Can I mark it as completed when I completely skipped through the last episode and barely read a single word?\n\nOverall this anime was incredibly bad. It started promising but then turned semi-episodic until the last half or so where the plot was just a big mess. The characters, or more precisely the 2 people actually give a damn about, were alright. Main dude was too op for my liking but a very engaging character.\n\nThis was also one of the worst sequels I've ever seen to the point where you could think this didn't actually have anything to do with Re:Zero. 5/10"
