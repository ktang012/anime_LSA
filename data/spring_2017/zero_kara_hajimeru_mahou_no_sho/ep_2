It is strongly denied that there is any truth to either possibility.\n\nMaybe you're right, and this gets explained later on, but the author isn't getting that point across.

Competition is ultimately good for the consumer, even if it's inconvenient to pay for multiple services.\n\nActually, you know what, I'm going to set up the social media campaign this week and post it here this Saturday. If people want Amazon to change, then they need to make their voice heard, instead of whining on discussion threads that will never be seen by the suits at Amazon."

It would be competition if they all had the same shows. The existence of exclusives means amazon can be as bad as they want so long as they pick good exclusives.\n\nThe \"competition\" here is between illegal services and paid services, and really none of the paid services are stepping up to the plate. Amazon's whole service is borderline unusable, and crunchyroll's video player is *terrible* despite theoretically having great quality."

   "text": "There's nothing to explain. First of all, your original statement was that the services do not compete against eachother. That is wrong, and is akin to saying Samsung and Apple don't compete because they have different products. Streaming services compete in providing streaming entertainment, and anime also competes against normal 3D shows.  \n  \nSecondly, quality is adequate to receive views. It obviously generates money, even if some fansubbers do a better job. Even if Amazon provided good and professional translations, you could still say \"explain the quality, because Asenshi colored their subs depending on what is being said\". Also, competition takes time. Iphone (original) took much time before the first real comparable competitor arrived, that could also take a significant market share. It took time, but it happened. Over time Amazon, CR, Netflix, FM and others may realize that they can further improve to increase views. At a certain point, improving quality will just cost more without adding significant revenue (for extreme example, when quality is best, improvements will not add views). Finding balance for these companies will take time, but it will happen. \n  \nLegal anime in the west will compete and keep improving, eventually getting more market shares and improving the market in Japan by paying for licensing. There is nothing major to worry about at this moment, and small things like honorifics or sub fonts can be affected by complaining on their official forums.  \n  \nAs an aside, anime is special as a streamed entertainment. There are (economic) whales that will spend thousands for stuff like merchandise and blu-ray. These diehard fans will not settle for bad quality. Companies will have to up their quality to milk these whales, similar to how some niche anime are made with extreme care and quality in Japan (mostly SoL), despite having low view count."

Like, Merc's stupidity just killed your beloved Zero for all you know! The Thirteen in the novel seemed like he was mad, at least!\n\nAnd why was Merc's stupid decision to save Thirteen was paid no mind at all? The novel explored it a little, not much, but at least it wasn't ignored.\n\nThe anime's expansion upon Albus and Holdem's quest to draw the magic circles while the Sorcerers of Zero gather to take down Thirteen is pretty boring. I thought I'd love it expanded, but if this is how it's expanded I'd rather it not expanded at all. It adds a lot of screen time, though, so I guess that makes sense why it was added."
