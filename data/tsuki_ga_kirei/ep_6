First, what better way to suggest the importance of the kiss to both their futures than to have it interrupted by a small child (which is something kisses eventually lead to). Second, and far heavier, consider the firework that's in the background at the moment they kiss: it's an unusual shape for a firework, but bears a remarkable resemblance to a human ovum."

She doesnt tell him the truth not only because she doesn't want him to get hurt, but also because she knows Tsubakis feelings for him.\nHowever, she was still shocked by the fact that the very person who fascinated her to start to play the violin is now emotionally in a very bad state. Her only goal was to show him the beauty of music again and make him overcome his trauma and she was successful. Sure she did some things that weren't 100% necessary, but since she also fell in love with him, its understable imo that she has trouble with holding back her feelings.\n\nSo that's why she didnt want to tell Kousei about her feelings, but why is it alright to tell it to watari? Because he's a player. Tsubaki made it clear that he doesn't take relationships very seriously and we saw that over the course of the anime. He kept dating other girls despite his \"relationship\" with Kaori and im 100% sure that Kaori knew about that. As she said it herself, the only reason why she started going out with him was to get closer to Kousei without having Tsubaki to worry that she has other things in mind. After all, she knew that she was going to die and that Tsubaki would have had a realistic chance to get together with Kousei.\n\nAnd at the end, she was kind of succsessful wasnt she? She helped Kousei with his trauma and from the end of the anime it's safe to assume imo that he'll get together with Tsubaki.\n\nI'm not going to say that the series is flawless, nor that you have to like it, but I found that this specific cirticism you made is not valid. One thing that bothered me throughout the first episiodes of tsuki ga kirei was the incredible shyness of the MC. Because of that he wasn't able to clear out the simplest misunderstandings at the beginning which was annoying af for me. Therefore it was very difficult for me to relate to him. Don't get me wrong, the female MC is also very shy, but hers is in moderation, the male MC has enough guts to ask her out, but then again too shy to explain as to why he was at the library with another girl. But idk, maybe thats normal for middle schoolers, but it doesnt change the fact that it is very annoying and frustrating. In YLIA, sure they acted very often older than they actually were, but that didnt diminish my enjoyment in any way, in fact it made me appreciate it even more, but that's just my personal preference."

I'm not sure why I added that second sentence in the spoiler text, and the third sentence I think you did a good job addressing. Honestly, I don't even remember that Watari was also dating other girls. He had so little influence in the show altogether that I probably didn't pay much attention or care about him at all.\n\nI will say, the main problem I had with the series, and what really ruined it for me (beyond simply not liking Kaori), was the slapstick comedy. [YLIA](/s \"I felt that Tsubaki and Kaori constantly curb stomping Kousei was in extremely poor taste especially since Kousei's physical abuse at the hands of his mother was a major factor in the series\").\n\nOther than those two gripes, I did really like the show. Which is part of why I have so much disappointment with it. The OP/ED's and general background music was fantastic, and I LOVED the arc with Kousei and Nagi, and Kousei and his old rivals. I think if the entire series had focused more on those people and removed the slapstick, I might have enjoyed it a lot more. "

Taking advantage of her close friend's good nature to try and wedge her self in was just a bitch move. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I still feel there is a tiny bit of fault for Akane to own up to, but if we were dealing in percentages I'd say Akane: 2%, Azumi: 1% (for not being clear he's not interested), and Chinatsu: 97%. \n\nI'm sure from Akane's view point she didn't want to cause friction between herself and Chinatsu. She also probably felt strongly that Chinatsu would come to see the error of her ways and value their friendship over Azumi. I think that is why Akane was so frustrated seeing Chinatsu overtly flirting with Azumi.

   "text": "> the show has pushed the other ships as being more logical in a lot of ways\n\nI couldn't agree more. That's what made this episode by far and away the best yet -- lots of character development!\n\nThe way this show has explored love, in so many forms and at such a genuine pace is unique. Coming from someone who knows what it's like to face awkwardness potent enough to suck the life out of an emerging relationship, Azumi's struggle to really be himself with Akane hit home from the very beginning. \n\nSure, they had some chemistry to start, but alone it wasn't nearly enough to carry them forward. Their awkwardness was pervasive, and while Azumi's successive attempts to spend time with Akane proved to grow their relationship enough to keep them afloat, to me that's all it was doing -- I had my doubts about whether it could ever take off, based on my own experience and especially given some of their tougher moments (department store, chinatsu crashing lunch, etc.)\n\nAnd in the middle of all of this, there was Chinatsu. From the start, her vibrant personality and disarming humor paired well with Azumi's quiet demeanor, and the extent of their chemistry was made evident in how quickly Azumi was able to come out and be himself with her. Whereas Azumi's kindling with Akane was born in relative shyness, his with Chinatsu was born of a far more secure sense of self. \n\nIn fact, given my own experience, I greatly enjoy watching Azumi and Chinatsu interact -- because I normally get tense watching him with Akane, waiting and hoping for their awkwardness to disperse, I literally breathe a sigh of relief watching him with Chinastu at how easily relaxed they can be.\n\nThis is where the show really shines -- presenting two different styles of love, emerging at the same time. Sure, Azumi and Akane are dating, but is it wrong to think that Azumi's chemistry with Chinastu makes them a more viable pair? Is it wrong to feel that one's love for another is real when it must compete with that for another?\n\nNow, don't get me wrong -- Chinatsu clearly began to push those boundaries this last episode in a way that even I acknowledge as morally questionable. She wanted to win over Azumi's heart even while she knew he was committed to someone else, and purposefully created a situation with the intent of testing his existing relationship while improving her own chances. \n\nAnd yet...I truly felt bad for her. When she began to cry at the sight of Azumi and Akane, I legitimately wanted to step into the damn anime and hug her myself. Her love for Azumi was just as real as Akane's, and yet it was only a difference in timing that separated the two and favored the emergence of one over the other. Many here are saying she had it coming -- I can't refute that. But from Chinastu's perspective...its very, very sad.\n\nBut meanwhile, Azumi! I couldn't believe he did it! The moment where he watches as Akane walks away with Hira, after having been cheated out of time with her at every turn of the day...I thought it was all over. If it were me, I never would have had the courage to step in between them. Even as I was amazed (and relieved for his sake) that he actually called out to her, I really thought it would do nothing but make it worse. \n\nAnd yet, I've never been more happy to be so wrong. It taught me a really important lesson about what it means to cherish a bond with another -- as the end screen so perfectly read, \"Hold Back Nothing When Taking Love.\" This was the most important decision of his relationship with Akane -- he may very well have lost her had he not made it, and even more significant it was the very catalyst he needed to secure the relationship and allow it to take off. \n\nIn a single decision Azumi grew in a way I never could at the equivalent time in my life: he conquered himself. He believed in himself, and he believed in Akane. He took her by the hand and asserted the legitimacy of what they really had together. He believed in their chemistry, and in doing so fully actualized it. \n\nI'm so proud of him!"

She's been pretty perceptive in the past, so I don't think she's this naive to the consequences of her original plan.\n\n> I don't see her actions here as necessarily trying to steal him away. I mean, she likes the guy, she still wants to get close enough to him so that she can confess to him, but then she misses out on that chance and sees him with her friend. As far as I'm concerned, it's perfectly reasonable to feel bad for her.\n\nEither she:\n\nA) she flirts with Azumi, gets close enough to him that she confesses and causes him to choose her instead of Akane.\n\nor \n\nB) she flirts with Azumi, pisses off Akane as a result, and still gets rejected.\n\nNeither sound like a good option. And why would she try to get closer to him before confessing if her intent was to get rejected anyway?"

   "text": "*Tonight on: Cockblock The Anime.*\n\nWow, that scene where the girls took Akane & Hira's picture wearing the matching caps I thought \"oh boy, here comes more missunderstandings\"\n\nProps to Roman being the bro, he knew he was the third wheel (or in this case the 9th wheel) and decided to hop on the rollercoaster solo so that the couples won't have odd numbers. But best of all, he didn't stay quiet when the group asked if Akane was dating Koutaro.\n\nMoving on to the main dish. Like I've been saying for the past weeks, Koutaro is the one carrying this relationship. I'm glad he manned up and didn't even flinch to give the 10-4 to Hira and make him back off his property. Damn producers, as if phone calls and other friends weren't enough cockblockers, now we get a little girl stopping the kiss from the main couple.\n\nI'm probably the only one feeling a bit sorry for Chinatsu. Yeah she knew she was entering uncharted territory and wanted to take a shot at Koutaro. In my ideal world she would at least had the chance to get shot down in person by Koutaro, like in [Hibike Euphonium] (/s \"Hazuki had a chance with Shuuichi\")\n\nChanging to the extras this week. Not really that appealing. I think Miou set the bar too high, and unless we see her interacting with Inaba it feels a tad hollow. Though I admit I like Sakura & her cute fantasies, hope she gets paired with someone at the end (maybe with some pink haired guy if things don't go well with a certain teacher)"

Specifically, Azumi's reaction to it, when contrasted with going on the roller coaster, shows precisely how much more enjoyable his life is with Akane around. :D\n\nI hope the anime doesn't have some kind of distance separation in store for our cute couple (a conjecture brought up by others previously). One goes away to become a runner, the other goes away to become a writer. Since the love square has been reduced to the singular, favorable line, it should prove interesting to see what drama the show has in store for both Akane and Azumi."

I mean I have no problem with her confessing, just say you like him, done, move on...BUT don't make it larger than it needs to be. Chinatsu trying to go alone with Azumi, sitting with him on the roller coaster, trying to get him to say his name AND vice versa, is not cool. She is literally one of the only people to know about the relationship (because Akane trusts her *bless her innocent soul*) and she's using that they are keeping it a secret to her advantage. Not only that, the fact that she KNOWS about them AND she's still making moves on Azumi is straight up rude and crafty. \n\nSad face for Hira though cus he's a good sport about it, he doesn't overstep his boundaries nor does he manipulate Akane as Chinatsu does to Azumi (i.e. How Chinatsu kinda forces him to say her first name)\n\nANYWHO- I'm more worried for Akane cus she still wants to stay friends with Chinatsu and she feels guilty for being with Azumi, WHICH SHE SHOULDN'T BE. Akane and Azumi like each other and are happy together, especially now that we're seeing that they're really growing on each other. Chinatsu shouldn't be guilting Akane for being with Azumi just because she also likes Azumi. Lol I guess I'm just trying to say that Akane needs to watch out for Chinatsu cus she might not be the type of friend she would like to keep, being all crafty and stuff :-/"

Also Chinatsu managed to teleport out of the giftshop scene and appear outside to run into Habanero-kun looking for Roman. Thankfully that was the only real egregious lacking animation part of the episode and the rest was reasonably solid and totally adorable in terms of character moments.\n\nAzumi and Akari's secret is now out in the open and will hopefully cause their friends to prod the couple into more cute moments with each other. Chinatsu was kind of a dick this episode knowing that the pair are going out and still making moves on Azumi. Seeing her cry made me sad as well though, so hopefully after this she can move on now that Azumi has proven how committed he is to Akari.\n\nCharacter shorts were once again cute and I like that this show depicts how shallow and catty girls can be in private sometimes with each other especially this episode. Its not something you often see in anime, so its a present surprise to see it depicted and also in such an amusing fashion."

Fuck that. I really hope Akane doesn't stress out at all over this.\n\nI really never minded Hira, so I do feel sorry that he found out about their relationship like this. Not how I expected it to go down at all. Speaking of, I feel like in real life, Akane could've taken Azumi's actions the wrong way no? Like him acting possessive of her while she's lost with Hira? Although, I guess Akane wasn't all that keen on being alone with Hira in the first place. Although I feel like this all could have been avoided if the two had just been open about their relationship to their friends in the first place. Akane's friends trying to set her up with Hira was really awkward.\n\nOverall, incredibly happy Akane and Azumi got to spend time alone together like a real couple. But can't help but feel like this episode got brought down a bit because of Chinatsu's slimy schemes and the secret of Akane's/Azumi's relationship making things more tense than they should have been in the first place.

The way Kotarou reacted to finding them might've come off as overly defensive, but I think Akane felt like she was partly to blame for it. In an adult relationship, seeing your other friends (of any gender) is something partners should work out and come to an agreement of in terms of time, commitment, and boundaries. In this informal situation, I think it's just a matter of equity. Akane must've felt like she had a small hand in this, so Kotarou's reaction is forgivable in her eyes. "

I feel like it's still a fucking terrible thing to do to a friend, attempting to get your friend's boyfriend to dump her for you. \n\n> Akane showed Kotarou a little displeasure over all the time he was spending with Chinatsu, and I'm sure she got lost with Hira a little on purpose to stew and maybe to dig at Kotarou a little bit.\n\nThis I'm not so sure about. Rewatched the episode and it seemed like Akane was keen on getting back to the group. I also really hope she wasn't trying to take a dig at Azumi, just because of seeing Azumi and Chinatsu together. That would definitely lessen my opinion of her. It's one thing to feel jealous and misconstrue a certain situation, but it's a whole other (and very scummy) thing to actively pursue a situation to make your boyfriend/girlfriend uncomfortable or jealous. It's the difference between feeling jealousy you can't control vs. creating an uncomfortable situation that is in your control, imo.\n\nAs other people have been saying in the past, I feel like Azumi's been carrying this relationship through all the discomfort and misunderstandings so I hope Akane starts to do her fair share. She did good telling Chinatsu she was dating Azumi, but I hope she continues that action with any future misunderstandings she can actively confront."
