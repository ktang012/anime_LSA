Feminists happened to focus on giving equal rights to women. It is something worthwhile to do despite it has lost most of it's meaning and value in the western societies where women is treated pretty well, though there is some minor unimportant things left (as an example imagine the reactions from onlookers if you punched a random woman on the street vs if it was a guy). \n\nFeminists who cares about rights and things like that probably is more concerned with how females is treated in 3rd world countries and probably doesn't give two shits how women is portrayed in media. Well except if it promoted misogynistic stuff, but that wouldn't be any different than if the media in question promoted racism. \n\nMy point being that there is a different between feminists who wants women to be treated as first class citizens in 3rd world countries (notably many muslim countries) and then there is SJW feminists here in west who are basically a plague who doesn't really want equality just a role reversal of the Victorian era.

   "text": "This. People who can't stop generalizing hinders the conversation. Every single category can be broken down into more categories. Blaming all feminists is as a pointless as blaming all men or even all humans. Anyone who says that \"feminists\" should just change the name of their movement if they want to be taken seriously are idiots. It's like asking people to change the name of their sex if they don't want to be associated with people of the same sex - it's an inane proposition, right? \"You don't want to be associated with extreme feminists? Then call yourself an egalitarian\" is the same as \"you don't want to be associated with male rapists? Then call yourself a woman or bluman instead of man.\" Absolutely retarded.\n\nHowever, I do want to say that caring about how women is portrayed in media isn't inherently a feminist thing nor is it wrong to do so. If there is one thing I don't agree with you on, it's this. People can see abnormality on TV. It's not exclusive to the portrayal of women. If anyone is misrepresented, and the audience detects that inconsistency with the real world, people would complain. If a woman or man is portrayed as a mentally retarded person enough times, it'll stop being funny and the public will complain. It's a natural phenomenon. I don't think it's fair to invalidate this and blame western feminists. Besides, they can also fight for proper portrayal AND women's rights in 3rd world countries. It all depends on how far they'll take it - that's what separates \"feminists\" from \"feminazis\". It's all about the methods, and the actions taken."

   "text": "As always, it depends on the definitions, which is what you're getting at here.\n\nIf you define feminist as \"advocate for women's rights\", then you would be right.  But I would define feminism as \"a largely female-led movement towards equality between men and women, by focusing on women's issues primarily\".\n\nFor the former definition, both A and B are feminists, therefore the no true scotsman holds up.  For my definition, which I think is more accurate (but that's a debate for another subreddit!), a female supremacist does not satisfy this requirement -- they are not working towards equality, they would instead be working towards inequality.  It's literally all just what you define things as.\n\nIn any case, it's semantic either way.  What the previous guy was getting at is that it's possible to support reasonable feminist policy, while also harshly criticizing the radical elements of that group and call them extremists.  Lumping them into one group also ignores the complexity of the issues, which leads to people having opinions of a largely reasonable group based on the actions of the most extreme.\n\nIf I may soapbox for a second, I think that's part of the reason why online discussions of politics these days are so toxic.  People only listen to the radicals of any point, and characterize their opposition by the vocal minorities.  Trump supporters assume the opposition are all SJWs.  Hillary supporters assume their opposition are all bigots.  I think most people are actually moderate in most of their viewpoints -- yet if you divide people between \"in\" or \"out\", or \"left\" or \"right\", or \"feminist\" or \"misogynist\", or whatever black-and-white distinction you're looking to use, it's harder to correctly characterize their points, and it's easier to fall into straw-man discussions rather than actual debates.\n\nI might add that I would not call myself a feminist or an MRA or anything.  I'm a moderate.  I think both \"feminist\" and \"MRA\" are politically charged terms, and carry stigmas in internet dialogue that I would not like to carry myself.\n\nI'm confused where you stand -- whether you're group A, but sympathize with B; whether you're group B, and want to maintain your relevance to the overall movement by denying being a separate group; whether you're group C, who dislikes both A and B, and wants to discredit A by associating B with them; or group D, who is moderate like me, but believes a different definition of \"feminism\" that must include group B by definition.  I'd like to challenge the idea that B is A, but it's just definitions after all.  It's literally all meaningless in the end.  It's not worth downvoting over."

   "text": "> you're clearly very liberal\n\nconsidering I voted republican in 2008 and 2012...ha.\n\nBut I digress, that is the definition though, according to feminism itself.  In the same sense, one might call \"trump supporters\" and \"neo-nazis\" the same group, because neo-nazis exist as a radical faction within trump supporters, but it makes sense to distinguish between the two.  Judging from your comment you're probably conservative -- I agree with you that there are large amounts of apologists within the feminist community that conveniently ignore the misogynists who call themselves feminists.  But I do think there is a lot of value to distinguish the two terms.\n\nAnd literally, it *is* about definitions.  For a political group, definitions are self-made, not externally defined, and a definition can be misleading or not carry all the nuances.  For instance, the wikipedia page for Black Lives Matter describes it as an \"international activist movement\", despite realistically only having relevance and sway in the US.  I don't think a wikipedia aside can accurately describe an issue in terms of \"is this person really following the central tenants of the movement\"?  You have to figure out what the central tenants are, which is a much more nebulous question.  You would get different answers if you talked to different feminists, which is what I'm saying here.\n\nFor other issues, you might be right.  If I was arguing about, say, radical muslim terrorists, and said \"they're not real muslims\", you'd have a point.  \"Muslim\" has no ambiguity to it -- if you believe in Mohammed and Allah, you're a muslim.  But \"feminist\" is far more nebulous, and wikipedia's \"advocacy for women's rights\" definition is inaccurate, given that there are feminist groups who focus on men's rights as well.  Or would you call them \"not real feminists\"?\n\nI hope I've explained my position succinctly, if I haven't tell me what you don't understand, or downvote me again and I'll try to explain."

This episode was A LOT better than the last one, as if they put more budget in the fights against the Five Swords. \n\nI feel like this was an introductory arc, perfect for those who follow the 3 episode rule. Episode 1 and 3 featured two different swords but were connected the sisters in episode 2, while here I don't know who is going to be the next stamp (I guess it's the shiro loli?) and there is nothing to connect this episode directly with episode 4.\n\nBattle scenes were **better than expected** (again, budget), Mary was a more \"unique\" character than I would have expected, but her voice acting was lacking something, the seiyuu was focused in the ojou-sama role (a different kind of ojou-sama, that doesn't *desu wa* every single second) and forgot the french accent she should've had. That was a pretty good japanese for someone that needs a dictionary. Rin's was good enough, but it felt a bit forced when she was searching for the Spanish Stairs... Ok, I wrote too much, hope someone actually reads it."
