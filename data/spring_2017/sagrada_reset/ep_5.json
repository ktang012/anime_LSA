   "text": "#This ep is exactly why i love this show and what ive been waiting for.  \n\nWe finally get the glimpse into Kei's mind regarding Soma and resetting, and of course he blames himself.  But him deciding the only way to atone for that is to save everyone else is pretty warped in a way.  We also see that he is afraid of resets, saying that he does everything the same way so he doesnt risk changing the future needlessly.  Thats the kicker here.  He mentions how troubleing and boring it is to him, how he feels like hes acting in a boring play.  Remember when ep1 came out and everyone complained that Kei sounded very unemotional and dull?  WELL THERE IS THE ANSWER WHY!  Because for the past few years hes been repeating these days again and again and experiencing the same things numerous times, so much so that is worn him down to this point of being nearly emotionless.  Its nice to finally get confirmation that the way he acted was because of the reset and memory powers.  It also makes me think the answer to Soma's robot question is that Kei is the robot, choseing the life of monotony and shelving his emotions.  Haruki was the robot but found her emotions so shes become human, but Kei took her place i think.  \n\nHaruki spending all day trying to reset so Kei doesnt hate her was really well done too.  It was very depressing and just makes your soul hurt watching her trying over and over.  We also now know why Haruki cant use her power anymore unless Kei tells her to, because she doesnt want Kei to hate her.  \n\nIts funny how people dismissed this show so much yet here it is explaining why things are the way they are, why characters seem pretty warped.  This is some A++ writing really, to plan ahead this much is very nice.  \n\nI cant wait for next week to see how things go from here.  This show is probably going to be my season fav, i love a well written drama and with it being about powers, even better!  \n\n[](#juice1)"

But after watching the 8th episode, I just hope people come back to this anime, and I hope it just keeps getting better.  \nI understand why people gave up, but damn, they're managing to build such an interesting story right now and I'm hoping it turns out to be something akin to Shinsekai Yori."

   "text": "Theory:\n\nWhat if Sumire was actually created by the Bureau to be the witch's successor.\n\n- The bureau is desperate to find a successor and never found one according to the witch. \n- One of the first things Sumire brings up is the android question. \n- The last thing she asks Kei is the android question, and I think Kei answered wrong. \n- Imitations of living things that weren't really real were a common theme among all her philosophical conversations with Kei.\n- She kinda knew when their friendship would end since she talked about only summer plans when they met and never said anything about plans beyond the summer (ie next school year). Thus the suicide may have been premeditated early on.  \n- Why would she talk to Haruki for a year, and wait that long to introduce her to another friend (Kei)? The reason she gives is that their types are too different. Nevertheless, there were friends for a year. Maybe she knew she didn't have much time left and wanted to introduce Haruki to a new friend as a replacement, meanwhile giving the person she loved to Haruki.\n- Mari was basically a created imitation of a human. Thus imitation of humans is a theme for Memory in Children arc. \n- Mari's issue was solved in episode 2/3 of the arc, yet that arc isn't finished. They didn't give Sumire her separate arc even though she didn't play a main role in Mari's issue, and the goal of 3/3 is presumably different: raising old friend from the dead.\n- The name if the arc has \"children\" in plural. You'll notice that nouns in other episode names are singular. Mari and Sumire may be the \"children\" and have the same struggle--the struggle portrayed throughout this arc.\n- In this episode we see a Bureau member strong enough to blow a hole in the moon in the area where Sumire jumped. She's probably not really there to build a fence. Sumire may have had Bureau ties already back then. \n- She also knew that ability copier guy who was loyal to bureau even tho girl was about to be forgotten."
