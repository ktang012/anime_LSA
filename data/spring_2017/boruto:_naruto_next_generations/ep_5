Hell, the fact that Sasuke had all of the bijuu on standby in the first and place and that Naruto secretly set up a Kurama clone to collect Senjutsu in the forest\n\nAnd that's just to name a few"

   "text": "I'm not saying tactics are **completely** useless or absent from Shippuden, but there's a reason why the vast majority of the characters stopped being relevant halfway through the manga. At some point either you were Hashirama, arguably Tobirama, Naruto, Sasuke, Guy, Madara or Obito and you can legitimately be part of the fight or you just stand by and watch. Look at the Naruto and Bee vs Jinchuuriki, Hashirama vs Madara, Naruto and Sasuke vs Madara, the way they won against Juubito, the whole Madara vs 5 Kages minus that gimmick at the end. Remember that most of the cast were totally USELESS * *looks at you Kakashi* *in battle for pretty much half of the manga. \n\nBeside not all of the fights you mentioned are equally about strategy and planning. Guy vs Madara was a one move showdown as Gaara's intervention was mostly fluff. Sasuke having the bijuus on standby and Naruto setting up Kurama clones were just ways to have the characters have more chakra to fund their Michael Bay fight. Just look at the Ultimate Jutsus in Ultimate Ninja Storm 4, just how many of them end up with teraforming ?"

Shadow clones have a lot of uses but I think to actually attack from all sides with tactical merit (not just dive in and get the shit kicked out of them) is my favourite and this episode is possibly my favourite example of that. \n\nBoruto and Sarada get a bit screen time together which is good going forward, it really sets up the leader dynamic Sarada takes as well. Intrigued as to who her sensei is though, wonder if it's anyone we know or just random shinobi #234, as we know at this point it can't be Sasuke."

I like that the kids this time round seem more capable on their own. I also like getting the odd glimpse at the grown up characters - Naruto, Hinata, Hanabi, Shikamaru.

I say that out of frustration, mind you, because I'm honestly enjoying it. However, we need to have some more competent characters. \n\nYou shouldn't be comparing where Naruto started to where Boruto is at now. Naruto is the adult and has two kids for god's sake. There are several other adults like the Hyuga grandpa that have the opportunity to help our young MC with his situation. The adults should realize there is a need to sit down with Boruto and discuss the situation. Instead they're like, \"It's not Byakugan and he's not lying so instead of doing the reasonable thing and asking him for more info I'm just gonna say I've got work to do cause fuck being a responsible adult toward my child. It's not like I've personally seen the devastation that eye powers can cause, or that I'm the fucking Hokage with a village of people to protect or anything. Not like I have a son trying to constantly 1-up me to seen attention and approval who then says he's got some crazy new eye power that we've proven isn't a Byakugan. It's also not like I've got a scientific team of former shinobi that are perfect for this kind of situation that have been shown to already be working on medical ninjutsu under the supervision of my former-crush/teammate Sakura who also has knowledge about eye powers. Seriously, I'mma just leave it be because I'm truly so busy with work.\" It's like we're in some alternate universe or something where reasonable logic is out the window just to stretch things out.\n\nMy point is... the shit is stupid. I enjoy getting to know all the side characters, but we just hit episode 9 where the first time he tries to activate the eye on his own will be episode 10. That means we've had Denki, Iwabe, Metal Lee, Chocho, Shino, Stalker-kun, Construction Worker, and movie star (might be missing 1 person) spread out across these 9 episodes. So far it's been a battle of the week where guy shows up with shadows and we stop him without venturing to learn more. To me, that's just a bit excessive and I don't enjoy the fact that it's taking so long to JUST NOW learn more about it. We also had Shikamaru explicitly say to Naruto that the ones who are drained of their chakra are people that came in close contact with Boruto. If there was ever a need to sit down and discuss things it should have been this episode. It's really bad writing."
