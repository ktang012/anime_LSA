All sorts of actors and motives flying around, people talking philosophy and other people talking like things are normal when they're not, people showing up out of nowhere with no explanation and shit. I know there is gonna be good reasoning behind all of this and it'll all make sense in the end, but this storytelling style annoys me all the same. I'd hate this show if I didn't like it so much. I'm so fucking intrigued by this, *fuck.*\n\nI'm so aggravated by this show, but I'm enjoying it too, it's like how petting a fat piece-of-shit cat that has a habit of knocking expensive shit off of tables can still be as comfy as heck.

Like Chiruchiru is a part of Michiru's consciousness that rules over the dream world while Michiru is the part of her that just wants to lay back and relax. My other guess is Chiruchiru is an entirely different person that's taking care of Michiru, just look at how he spoke with Sumire. It felt like he was a completely entire being from Michiru.\n\nAlso why is Sumire there? I get that Kit Kat girl is there since she works for the  Bureau but Sumire? Is she nearby? Is she hiding somewhere around the hospital? Also Chiruchiru spoke with Sumire as if they've known each other for a long time now.\n\nAh this fucking show, there's just something about it's all confusing mystery that keeps me coming back every week.

She also was mad that Kei was with haruki?  That one is confusing because it was Sumier who introduced them and more or less made them a set.  So why would she be mad now i wonder.  \n\nKei wants to save Sumier so he wants to test it in a dream world, a world where someone is god, but they seem to know Sumier too.  So did this person enter thier dream after she died then?  They said shes been asleep 9 years though...  \n\nThe dream world its self is pretty erie and i bet is bugging the shit out of Kei since he sees how different it all is.  \n\nGiant monster attacks too, ide bet thats gonna be some part of the girl's concious or something going wild in the dream world.  \n\nI guess we will find out next week!
