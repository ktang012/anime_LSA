I'm asking because if you look at the manga (and the anime's adaptation), each episode is usually 2 chapters worth of content. This week covered chapter 26 and 27, which would leave 6 remaining chapters in this arc to cover over two episodes. And without spoiling anything, it makes perfect sense that episode 11 would follow the same 2 chapter formula (based on how chapter 29 ends).\n\nBut this would leave 4 whole chapters for the finale. I can see them putting it together okay, but things just seem to line up so perfectly for 13 episodes I can't help but check to see whether it really is currently scheduled to be 12 episodes or not. Either way, I'm really looking forward to see how they handle the next two episodes. They'll make for a really fantastic final arc! Can't wait."
