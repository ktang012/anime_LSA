I'm trying to think back about the past 11 episodes and you know what? I can't even recall a single episode where I felt bored. I love that the show knew what it was and never held back. I'm gonna give this the same score I gave OreImo which is a 10/10 lolis. \n\nI'm not sure about the state of the LN but I do hope there's enough material for a 2nd Season. With how much attention Dengeki Bunko gave this series I'll be surprised if they didn't make a follow up.\n\n"

   "text": "> It seemed that the main purpose of this show was an method to deliver barely legal (if it's even legal) sexualizations of 12 year olds.\n\nA good way to understand lolicon is that their desire is placed on virtual young girls in such a way that they 1) dissociate that desire entirely from reality and real people, and thus 2) actually become *more* adverse to placing desire upon real children than your average person.\n\nThey have incredibly strict codes of fantasy play, and there is no citable evidence that what they read, watch and make contributes to issues of actual pedophilia. So there's no legal precedent against a cartoon like this given the history of lolicon in otaku."

Guess there's no one better to entrust than the author himself on how the first season of his own anime adaptation should end, by making it as funny as possible.\n\n- The secondary title of this episode ought to be: ***The One where Eromanga-sensei actually became Eromanga-sensei in name and mannerism*** (But I must agree with Eromanga-sensei: Elf and Muramusa look absolutely [sexy in their bikinis](https://i.imgur.com/8prknue.jpg) once again)\n\n- Bookstore Girl Tomoe finally reappears after so long, and she leaves it till the last episode to announce her intention to [join Masamune's harem](https://i.imgur.com/4PPbK73.png).\n\n- If we can have 16-year-old Sawamura Eriri in SaeKano draw hentai doujins regularly since she was 8 years old, guess I shouldn't be too shocked at 12-year-old Sagiri [drawing her first hentai doujin](https://i.imgur.com/caTcPrj.png).\n\n- Megumin's little brother probably an [avid Battlefield1 player](https://i.imgur.com/BEBJ71M.png). Poor him having to pose naked so Megumin can draw what a boy's penis looks like.\n\n- And what a way for Muramasa to use [Michaelangelo's David statute](https://i.imgur.com/WmPn4Tj.png) to bypass the censors, and thus, we probably have seen the first time that a penis is shown live on TV for a non-R18 anime.\n\n- Wow, Sagiri spent the entire season *still* being a shut-in, though credit where credit's due, she *has* still made some significant breakthroughs: \n\n1. Stepping out of her room\n\n2. Showing her face to her stepbrother's friends\n\n3. Actually stepping out of the house (without Masamune knowing) just to buy his new LN\n\n4. Opening the window to greet Masamune's friends \n\nKnowing how Oreimo's first season worked, I fully expect Eromanga-sensei to get the Oreimo treatment in extra OVA episodes tacked on to the end of this season.\n\nPS Make sure you [watch till the end](https://i.imgur.com/Xq8WkSt.png) of this final episode's ED."

Most \u201cdirty thoughts\u201d just happen inside the viewers mind, and i think this is Eromanga-sensei Manga and Anime Secret.

   "text": "So, basically this Eromanga Sensei has 11 episodes and an OVA.\n\nAfter a long time thinking about this show ~and trying to avoid the unstoppable thought of going to jail~ I'd say this show could be described in one line: **\"A terribly disturbing idea excellently executed\"**.\n\nThis is the anime you show to a friend to show him how far can Japan take things. Seriously, at some points I was about to close the damn episode (every one of them) and ditch this series of my life. She is 12! TWELVE! Damn pedophiles...\n\nBut then... Despite being a sick barely-legal piece of shit... It was funny. I had fun watching this madness, and that's because it's pretty well executed. The art is beautiful, the character design is on spot, the lewd scenes are well made (and precisely this makes me feel the Imouto thing *almost* ruined it); the gags are funny AF (I laughed too much this episode), the OST is catchy, I can't stop singing the opening in my head, even the background music.\n\nYou can, like me, hate lewding a 12 year-old ~~ELF BEST GIRL~~ but you can't deny they did it right. And that's why I'll give this disgusting utter pedo-trash an **8/10**. Would enjoy a second season."
