   "text": "This is because of the first AoT OVA: Ilse's Dairy. I'm going to put spoiler tags here, since it's an OVA and therefore not many people go out of their way to catch them, but I don't think this is meant as a spoiler at this point, so feel free to drag over and not be totally destroyed, ok? 'Cause I'll be doing more of a synopsis so the whole picture can be understood. \n\n[Anyway, Ilse's Dairy OVA](/s \"Everything that happens during the OVA happens during the training day times. During the 49th (I think?) recon campaign, Hange is constantly asking for a chance to capture a Titan, and refused. While disobeying orders, she tries trapping an aberrant, but fails when the aberrant runs back into the forest it came from and starts smacking its head into a tree in a clearing. Levi and his crew show up to kill the Titan, Hange tries to stop, someone almost gets killed, then *it* happens: one of Levi's subordinates notices a headless recon body in a hole in a tree. This person is Ilse - a recon member who'd been missing for almost over a year - as they find her notebook lying not far from the body and, obviously, the fact her name's on the jacket. What we learn from the diary is that Ilse was cut-off from her horse, which ran away, and her platoon, which was decimated. So she ran, documenting everything she could. What is important to note at this point are Ilse's features: she is slightly darker, dark brown hair, dark brown eyes - in other words, aside from the freckles, she looks a lot like Ymir. Why this is important is that, Ilse runs into the previous clearing and basically gets her head wrapped around the aberrant's mouth. Quite unexpectedly, the Titan releases her and *starts talking*, apologizing, calls her \"Ymir-sama\" and even prostrates itself before her. Ilse is confused, demands general answers like why them, who or what *are* Titans, etc. The aberrant is clearly distraught and, whether through the questioning or not, lashes out and eats her head. After realizing what it had done, it picks up the body and places it in the tree as a sort of funeral rite. All of this information is what Hange needed to convince Erwin to let her capture a Titan, which she then captures three with no causalities. \")\n\n*That* was why Ymir's name had such an impact, or at the *very least* why. There is absolutely more to it than that, but that's all we've gotten to connect those dots."

Reiner looked at Ymir like he knew something just before the titan attack on the castle. I'm guessing Ymir made the titans come and Reiner knows. Bertolt I'm sort of confused about, still think he's guilty by association though. Also, that look Bertolt gave in that scene in Connie's village makes him seem awfully suspicious.

[Ova Spoilers and Speculation](/s \"Before watching this, I knew that in this OVA a titan spoke about Ymir because someone recently posted a thread in r/shingekinokyojin saying that this should have given the higher ups read flags about Ymir in the 104th Scout Regiment. People assumed that either Ymir is common name of the higher ups didn't know about her name. The second was true. But it only proves my theory. I'm almost certain Ymir has the ability to control the titans. But I'm also sure she isn't the \"final boss\" by any means.\")  \n  \n[Speculation](/s \"Titans have exited for a very long time. I can only assume humans have been controlling them for a long time. Krista's family is also related to it somehow because Ymir seems to know about Krista's family. Krista is mysterious as fuck but Ymir seems to *just know* about her family. I'm assuming that Krista's family is in control of the Church as another comment suggested and that Ymir's family or *people* are in control of that titans. This explains why Ymir knows about Krista. It's because the Church knows about the titans as the priest suggested. The titans and the Church are working together or know of each other. Krista's family and Ymir's family/ people are working together or know of each other. This isn't what I expected. But I'M SO FUCKING EXCITED. This show is amazing. Every episode gives a couple answers but a dozen questions but if you look out for them, it gives even more clues. The show, the writer and everyone involved is a fucking genius.\")"

This is just speculation based on their appearances being reminiscent of the armored and colossal titans, how they're always seen together, and conveniently weren't around when the attack on Trost began.\n\nThe Beast Titan I've yet to figure out. Definitely looks like he has the ability to control other titans, and I'm guessing he's the one who turned the humans in the villages (like Connie's) into titans considering he's been coming from the south as well. As to whether he's a human who can become a Titan, I'm not so sure yet. \n\nAnd I'm not quite sure how Ymir fits in yet either but they've made it obvious she's working with Reiner and Berthold based on what Reiner said to her just before the titans attack the castle and also the look all 3 of them give the Beast Titan (seems they recognize him/know who he is). There's also the scene in the Notebook ova (which is canon) where a Titan speaks and says Ymir's name (calling her Sama and kneeling). Which explains why Hange freaks out when the Priest says they need to keep and eye on Krista (who is always with Ymir). \n\nThat's all I can come up with based on what we've been given.

However, Who are these special Titans that are Humans, and why would they want to destroy humanity?\")\n\n- [About second Theory: ](/s \"Why would Eren's father become people into Titans, he seemed to be very worried about Eren and his family. Of course he must have transformed Eren into a Titan in the second episode, when he \"We don't know how\" put the key in the Eren's neck. However, why should he be in the faction of the Titans and worry about his human family?\")\n\n- [About third Theory: ](/s \"Ymir could be a Titan, However, I think she likes Krista, she tried to convince her to be in the capital as a guard. If she is a Titan, why would she want to protect Krista in this way? Does that mean that she knows that the capital is never going to be taken by the Titans? What is the real objective of the Titans in this case? About Rainer, I don't think he is a Titan, he really seems like the armored one, However, he has a big sense of justice plus he seems kinda ignorant about the topic (For example during the Annie attack in the forest), also likes Krista, and is very focused about helping others, fighting vs the Titans and those things. (Furthermore, I don't think he says that to Connie because he is a Titan, but he says it because he really wants to protect and knows that Connie could be very worried about his family, but also knows that they cannot waste time on that since they have to help)\")\n\nSorry for the big text x) I just wanted to discuss a bit about that, tell me what you think :)\n\nPD: [What do you mean by ](/s \"\"The Order\"?\")"

It might just be because of fansubs but Krista says 'I don't know how you did it,but...'. Please correct me if I'm wrong.\n\nQuite an important detail they missed in the anime was when Reiner picked up the tin can and said'What's the meaning of this Ymir' it is because the writing on the tin can is something only Ymir could read and Reiner is obviously suspicious. \n\nReally loving the show so far, can't wait till next week!"
