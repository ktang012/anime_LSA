They try to keep everything as close as they can without changing the words too much, and if they do have to change the words they keep the original meaning in tact at least. The only reason any of it might sound weird to you is because you just aren't used to their voices yet. I actually really like Deku's English voice. It sounds like the perfect mix of timid-but-determined that defines his character so well.\n\nIf you're ever in the mood to rewatch the series, I definitely recommend checking out the dub. They're doing an amazing job with it and I like making sure people see the kind of quality effort that goes into this dub that you normally don't see. \n\nHere's another good one from the dub: [All Might's battle against Nomu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TFAGAyLzcg).

You can find these in the Trivia section at the bottom of each [character's page](http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Characters) on the [BNHA wiki](http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Boku_no_Hero_Academia_Wiki).\n\n* Her name Uraraka means \"bright, beautiful\", and Ochako \"tea child\".\n* Tenya's name comes from \"\u97cb\u99c4\u5929\" (idaten), meaning \"great runner\". \"\u54c9\" (ya) is a final exclamatory particle.\n* Tsuyu's name contains the kanji for frog (\u86d9), puff (\u5439), and Japan's rainy and humid climate (\u6885\u96e8), the latter which is the climate during the toad's egg-laying season.\n* Denki's family name contains the kanji for above (\u4e0a), sound (\u9cf4), and is read as kaminari (\u304b\u307f\u306a\u308a) the word for thunder (\u96f7). His given name is written and read as electricity (\u96fb\u6c17).\n* Katsuki's name is composed of \"\u7206\" (baku) from \"\u7206\u7834\" (bakuha lit. \"explosion\") and \"\u52dd\" (ka(tsu)) from \"\u52dd\u3064\" (katsu lit. \"to win\").\n* Izuku's name contains the kanji for \"green\" (\u7dd1), \"valley\" (\u8c37), \"coming out/being from a certain place\" (\u51fa) and \"long ago\" (\u4e45).\n\"\u4e45\" is also homophonous to \"nine\" (\u4e5d usually read as Ky\u016b), which refers to him being the ninth user of One For All.\n* \"Deku\" (\u30c7\u30af lit. \"one who can't achieve/do anything\") is another reading of his name Izuku (\u51fa\u4e45).\n\nThe point of Izuku's name is that his name is supposed to sound generic and underwhelming. A comparable name in English would be something like \"Bobby Brown\" or \"Bobby Green\" if you wanted to keep the green theme at least. His name also can be read as \"Deku\" hence where his nickname originally came from. And, like it says, it refers to him being the 9th person to use OFA. So Izuku's name was very carefully crafted to hit all of these major points at the same time. Such is the genius of Horikoshi's naming conventions. Often times when a new character shows up in the manga, people examine their name to try to get a hint/clue about what their quirk is about.\n\nBe careful reading through the wiki pages so you don't accidentally see any spoilers. The trivia subsection is usually safe enough."

It basically takes all the good tropes and executes them almost flawlessly while also adding its own twist to the genre here and there. Horikoshi truly knows what he's doing. He is a great writer and artist.  \n  \nAnother Anime that does this exceptionally good that I can recommend you is Hunter X Hunter. Don't get scared away by the huge number of episodes. It's definitely worth every second. It's still my favorite Shounen Anime of all time alongside the legendary Fullmetal Alchemist:Brotherhood.  \n  \nBnHA is slowly climbing up there too. :)"

I've seen plenty of anime where I could have read up on the manga to see where the story is heading (such as Attack on Titan or One Punch Man) but I've always been patient enough to just wait for more anime episodes to come out. BNHA is the first time where I couldn't wait, even though it was only 1 week until the next new episode. I love this series and these characters so much that I had to go read the manga. \n\nSo it's more accurate to say that I'm brand-new to manga. The only other times I had seen manga had been when people had posted examples comparing them to anime I had seen. For example, I've never read through the Dragon Ball manga but I've seen plenty of DB manga pages during online DB/DBZ/DBS discussions. "

Why I really like Deku, it has meaning to it, but it doesn't give anything away about him."

She'd actually be a really fucking good sidekick too, because if you distract the villian, she's got an open goal.\n\n> Likewise, where would Mineta be of use?

I think his versatility is his strong point, he'd definitely be good support for combat or rescue. I can't really see him ever breaking out on his own though.\n\n"
