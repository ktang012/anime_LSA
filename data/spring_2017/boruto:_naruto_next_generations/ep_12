Gotta love an old school Ninjutsu battle and there's more to come. \n\nThe idea of mixing up the teams before they are formed is really helping to get the dynamics established early, which I think works really well. \n\nI might just somehow like Shikadai more than Shikamaru, get to see Metal Lee next episode who seems like he has some baggage. (and if my conclusion is that Tenten is his mom is correct then his baggage is pretty obvious xD) \n\nI really like Boruto's character and he's obviously learnt a lot from his dad (mix himself among the shadow clones and hold one back being one technique). He has good battle tactics which id what makes for the most interesting fights. \n\nJust excited to see more, interested to see when Mitsuki gets introduced as he doesn't seem to be a part of the class at the moment. \n\nAlso Shikamaru and Temari next episode hype!

It's a damn sailor fuku. What the hell.  No where would it ever be in Naruto.  Her clothing is so out of place and warped, it doesn't even fit as some mook grunt's outfit or person from another village.  I'll definitely give her character somewhat of a chance, but man, her clothing design alone is so jarring in the world of Naruto and it immediately makes me reject her.\n\nI'm actually open to see the advancements in technology interact with the traditions of shinobi and their fights and missions.  I accept that there is still newer fashion designs, but her sailor fuku is so themed and specific, it sticks out like a sore misplace thumb. I can see how the school is more like a conventional school.  I can even accept the laptops.. But her design man.  Like, it feels so cheap, and she already acts like Hinata with her blushing and franticness.  And a school prep to boot.  If they just fixed her darn clothes at the least; I could much better welcome her and give her a stronger chance.\n\n Edit: Upvoting you though because you like the characters you like, it's cool.  I like my characters, you like yours."

The whole story could progress with us learning no more information about hom, and he'd still be an interesting character.\n\nWith how Hinata was, even without learning her backstory, observing her throughout the anime and manga and her actions and dialogue and reasons, she is also interesting.

Chock full of anime tropes (a good chunk of anime is though these days - $$$), a significant drop in animation quality. Everything was very predictable and a lot copied from Naruto. The pacing was way too fast. The original started off so strong because it had great character introductions and a lot of time was spent in the classroom, around the academy, before any actual fighting started. You cared about the characters before they started fighting each other. Iwabe was just the epitome of your typical anime rival, and a pretty shabby one at that. \n\nDon't send me into downvote hell! I'm still gonna watch the rest of the series because Naruto. I'm hoping just as much as you that the series becomes a great one.

This major conflict internally and externally which was a set up in the the movie (which I'm not sure if it is cannon, please correct me on this) and the first episode for not only Boruto but for Denki as well. After they semi-resolved this for Denki in the first episode I expected the academy arc to be about Boruto earning the respect of the class slowly or classmate by classmate. I knew it wouldn't go as slow as the hundreds of episodes it took Naruto to earn the respect he deserved but come on. One short, I mean really short, Naruto vs Neji esk fight scene later and Boruto has not only earned the respect of his classmates but the Iwara as well leaving no conflict to build on for future episodes. Talk about squandering up a cool reversal of roles where the main character is the literal prodigal son and the rival is the failure. It would have been interesting to explore the other side of the rivalry. \nThis show is going to be compared to *Naruto* for obvious reasons and it is off to a slow start. In *Naruto*, the first 2 episodes sets up who Naruto is, his goal, his rival, and his trial to overcome. I know that *Boruto* is not a carbon copy and should not be however, I don't know if it has as clear of a direction as the opening flash forward may suggest. I've almost forgotten about Denki's weird power thing.\n\nThis is a general complaint. Denki and Iwabe feel generic. Like really generic. Also, this is a spin off of *Naruto*, unless its world building you don't need to explain basic concepts like chakra. "

I thought that's what the specific subreddits were for, at least for long running anime (Which this most probably will be)?\n\nOh well, not a bad episode - Even if in the end this Iwabe guy and everyone except the kids that showed up at the end of the manga end up not mattering for shit after this arc, they seem at least more entertaining than the average filler character from the original series. I quite like the overall look of it, even though the animation took a pretty serious dip from ep 1 but whatever, that's just par for the course. Right now I do enjoy the fact that Boruto can at least somewhat back up his boasts, makes his confidence feel more earned.\n\nThis dude though... He's lecturing everybody about how the academy is accepting weaklings even though he's the one who's repeating the year because he's shit at everything except the one thing. Maybe he should take projections classes, he'd be really good at those lol"
