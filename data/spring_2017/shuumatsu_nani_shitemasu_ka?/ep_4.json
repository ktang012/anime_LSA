Also a new insert song titled \"I call you\", playing just before the ending.\n\nI would say they did a really good job of it.

What makes up a person's identity? Is it the body, or what's in it, the memories and the experience that is inside it. Chtholly is losing her memories, and when she wakes up without them, she won't even know who she is, let alone anybody else. She essentially would be reborn into a different person. It's extremely tragic. Even if she learns of the memories through a diary, it is as if reading a novel, and telling the story as your own.\n\n\nIt seems like the next episode or the final episode would return us back to episode one's starting sequence, where the Chtholly we know would be gone.

She chooses to move forward pretending to be Ithea, however she has something Ithea never had, a completely alternative life, wisdom, emotional set, etc. Because she is in essence, a completely different person, acting as Ithea. \n\nYou keep saying \"Ithea lost etc\" she didn't lose anything, Ithea was REPLACED by a soul, that soul then chose to pretend to be Ithea. \n\nCtholy's memories are slowly being eaten away to make room for what is attempting to replace her. Until she is replaced, I agree with you that she is Ctholy. However once Ctholy is replaced by \"Ruby Redhead\" Ctholy would have died, this is why everyone views it as death, because it is. Now Ruby Redhead will be in control of Ctholy's body and Ruby Redhead can do whatever the hell she pleases with it. If Ruby Redhead chooses to take on the shoes of Ctholy, that's not the same person the male lead fell in love with, its someone pretending to be.\n\n\n\n"

Either way, poor \"Ithea\" :(\n\nThe episode was pretty good and pretty chill, actually. I didn't get why Chtholly was making the scarfs but getting here in the thread I finally understand it.

   "text": "The \"Shiantor\" doesn't necessarily have any special meaning, it's just a Japanese reading of the name. The novel translation is actually a fan-translation (which is pretty common, relatively few LNs get licensed and officially released in English) and it was started at the beginning of 2016. Official/intended spelling in Latin script wasn't available or known back then, so translator had to rely on original spelling in Japanese for all names. For this reason, most names in LN translation are somewhat different from the variants used in the anime.\n\nBtw, where did you learn about the First Beast? I don't remember it being mentioned in the anime. And where did you see the \"Chantr\u00e9\" spelling?\n\nIntended names for all Beasts and Carillons (relict swords) seem to be either Latin or from one of the languages that [evolved from Latin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romance_languages), which includes French.\n\nTimere is \"fear\" in Latin, Aurora is \"dawn\" in Latin. Another possible and quite likely alternative to Shiantor/Chantr\u00e9 is Chanteuse, which means \"songstress\" in French. Or perhaps Chanteur - \"singer\" in French.  \nChanteuse is the most likely intended spelling because \"la chanteuse\" is an alternative title of one of the chapters in the novel.\n\nAs for the swords: Insania = insanity (Latin), Historia = history (Latin), Desperatio = hopelessness/despair (Latin). Can't find Seniorious, it probably should be Senioris which means \"elder/senior\" in Latin. Can't find the correct form and meaning for Valgulious.\n\nAlso, there was a related discussion in one of the previous topics: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6e88aw/spoilers_shuumatsu_nani_shitemasu_ka_isogashii/di8na6s/\n\nAnd as another user has already said, there is also a [manga adaptation](https://www.mangaupdates.com/series.html?id=138616). So even if we don't get an illustration for something in the LN, there is also an option of waiting for it to appear in the manga.  \nThat is, if manga will reach that point. There is always a risk of it being cancelled prematurely. From my limited knowledge, manga series get axed more frequently than LNs."

I learned about her there and there is also the spelling \"Chantr\u00e9\".\n\nI see, I didn't know that everything was derived from Latin or a language evolved from Latin, especially Aurora, didn't know that word had a place in Latin.

Now that you clarified and given even the most probably right name for her, I may even try giving it my take, with the name \"Chantr\u00e9\", and see how it cames about with my own ideas... at least for fun :P\n\nAnd yeah, the manga adaptation. I would like for them to get to vol5 and see the image of her, exactly what is she physically, but as you say, they first must get there, and that might be pretty hard... although the show seems to be doing ok right now... unless there are some numbers that disprove what I have read lately of course, but if it is doing fairly ok I think it is reasonably to expect them to get to vol5."

   "text": "I've just looked into that lore document and it is choke-full of spoilers. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it is one huge spoiler from the beginning to the end.\n\nReading it before you learn all that stuff from the LN is definitely not a good idea.  \nLore is revealed very gradually in the novel. It is what adds the mystery element to the story. And learning about their world and its past, bit by bit, hugely enhances the experience while reading.\n\nWell, there is no point in crying over spilled milk. And maybe you even knew what you were getting into. But author of that document really should have added a clear and visible warning that it's not something you are supposed to know before delving into the story yourself.\n\n> I see, I didn't know that everything was derived from Latin or a language evolved from Latin\n\nI don't know about everything, what I was talking about are names of Beasts and Carillons.\n\nAnd regarding the manga. I'm not sure if you know this, but 1 LN volume is not equal to 1 manga volume. Typically, it takes 2 manga volumes to do a decent adaptation of 1 LN volume. And if mangaka goes for a very detailed and faithful adaptation, then it can be 3 or even 4 manga volumes per 1 LN volume.  \nSo we would have to wait much longer than manga vol 5, if we want to reach the same point in the story as LN volume 5. Luckily, this is not necessary. Shiantor is mentioned in the epilogue of first LN volume (this scene was not present in the anime). So with any luck, we might get some visuals in first 2-3 volumes of the manga."

I could read the fan-translation, but I wanted to first let the anime do some work and see how it comes. Sadly I think the anime isn't actually doing a good job now, and I don't care that much about the relationship of Willem and Chtholly, although I can safely recognize it as a healthy relationship, although, again, I don't care as much.\n\nI didn't realize then, but probably that came into play with my choice of reading the document. I also had some minor spoilers there and there and my writer soul that fires up when he sees something that could be a pretty great idea to write a story about also played a part. I do get enjoyment reading about lore of fictional universes and I think I do care enough now to watch the anime until the end thanks to reading that document, so it was worth it, especially if the anime doesn't get another season, which I can see happening, and thus we won't get to see said lore in full glorious animation. So yeah, as you say, I did knew what I was getting into, especially if some many little interesting things that are in the LN about the world are not displayed in the anime, I just had to know :-)\n\nAlthough I totally understand you and I agree that anyone else should read at least the fan-translation and enjoy the story little by little.\n\nI see, well, I do hope then that the manga adapts from the very beginning with the epilogue. It won't be animated but that can make shine other aspects of the character pretty well."

It helps to strengthen the understanding of the life she leads and clings to as well as what drives her forward.
