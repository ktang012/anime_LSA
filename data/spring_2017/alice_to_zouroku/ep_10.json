   "text": "I almost forgot how difficult it is for kids to even utter the word 'sorry' until this episode. It's not often that kids are portrayed properly in anime and the only other time was in Amaama to Inazuma, so this is a delight to watch. Really liking Sana's relationship to Sanae too, as well as the grumpy grandpa versus kid dynamic. He's harsh but always well-intentioned.\n\n[tfw your superior is very clearly bullshitting.](http://imgur.com/a/DomUN) She seems to be a legitimate 'good person' from the OP, unlike the superior...\n\nngl I had the same question as Sana: how did the pigs come into existence, and what happens to them if she magics them away? Also wondering if that pig got erased from everyone's memories, as it seemed implied. \n\nThings are quite far away from calm this episode. Those arms are creepy as hell, and I believe Minnie C. is interested in Sana's powers to bring her husband back...we all know how these sort of scenarios normally go ~~very badly, and they never work~~. \n\nSana has a seemingly unlimited amount of 'cards', but other Dreams of Alice can only have one. I'm still not all that interested in this storyline, but Alice to Zouroku has become my most anticipated anime of the week. It's so cute! "

Do they even have those in Japan?!\n\nWe got some really interesting insight into Alice's Dreams this week, particularly the fact that most who have it can have a 'card' which limits their use of it, which explains why the girl from episode 1 could only make things that included chains. I guess that the boy with the sketchbook's card is that he can only create things that he draws. Which makes him probably the closest to Sana in terms of power, if you want to call it that. And we also found out that it can be spontaneously brought on by extreme trauma, as in Minnie C's case. Her card being her husband's arms is a really cool way to show how unhinged she is, as well as just a really creepy power. Also, a man in anime with hairy arms?! Is it a day that doesn't end in y?!\n\nIt was kinda nice how they wrapped up the whole pigs situation properly, with them being taken away to be researched, rather than it just being a throwaway joke. And Sana wondering what would happen if she decided to just get rid of the pig was interesting as well. It looks like the consequences of using her power to make living things are going to be explored, which should be interesting. It looks like Minnie C wants Sana to bring her husband back to life. I wonder if she can do it. "

The background themes of lawfullness vs lawlessness (Zouroku vs. the researchers), truth vs. lies, light vs. dark, Alice & Wonderland, service to others vs. service to self, people manifesting their desires into something physical and controlling their own realities through thought alone... lots of interesting parallels.

The first week with its awful cgi was a bit much... But each week has gotten better. I loved Minnie C's development this episode.\n\nAlso, where did the spotted piggy go!? "
