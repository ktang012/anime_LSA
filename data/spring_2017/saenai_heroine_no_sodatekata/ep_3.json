I came to the conclusion that professionals in these sorts of creative fields will literally die to get so much as a whiff of \"success\" in their respective industries. That's exactly why I don't want to go professional: I don't believe in a system where you have to work yourself into an early grave to get that chance.\n\nMy personal belief is that there is no career in this world worth dying for. No idea or prospective goal is worth your health. I like the things I like, and I'd like to live a long life so that I can continue to explore the things that I like.\n\nAll this to say, I think what you guys are talking about is an endemic issue with a lack of self-respect on the part of the workers, and an overall abuse of workers by their superiors for their own monetary gain. This issue seems to lend itself well to the discussion of Karoshi in Japan, and the nature of the relationship between businesses and the people that work for them.\n\nSlight Edit: I also think that the author of Bakuman was being very half-assed about the discussion of overwork in the workplace, and I disapprove the stance that he seemed to be taking with the subsequent chapters on the topic. Especially considering that Mashiro's uncle, died from overwork at a very early age. "

   "text": "I agree that from the point of view of the worker, being told to die for the project is insanity.\n\nHowever, artists and creators have a real competitive mentality. Improving yourself, being the best you can be and then going beyond - that's a mentality that is incredibly hard to follow through. Competitive sportsmen(swimmers, soccer players etc) also go through that same verbal abuse - speaking from experience here. When you're trying to go beyond your limits, to jump over that *fucking wall*, you need someone to tell you do die, destroy your body and tell the pain to go fuck itself.\n\nWhen you want to improve, you *will* hit walls, and when someone tells you that that wall *is nothing* and that you are so basic *I can reproduce your own work*, a naturally competitive person will be tempted by that idea. \"Where I was before, I *barely* improved my own self only when I was under massive pressure. You're telling me you can bring something even beyond out of me for that and all I have to do is simply *die*? Sign me the fuck up!\"\n\nNo, it's not healthy. The levels of chemicals that go through your brain when you *finally* go above and beyond that *fucking wall* are beyond addictive, so much that a slump will throw you into massive depression. Quitting that realm after experiencing that high is *really fucking hard*. Companies know that and will abuse that, much like a drug dealer will give a junkie only enough for him to want to come back.

Fuck Megumi's feelings about the circle too while we're at it, why should we tell her? N-not like we didn't enjoy the time at all though, but fuck you both still!!\n\nFucking hell that was sad to watch. Yes the girls deserve the opportunity but the point is sincerity, people. Utaha and Eriri sure failed that with how they handled Tomoya. Yes he failed *his first time* as a producer, but as a friend, aside from all the usual protagonist density, he has shown nothing but humility and consideration towards the two, because he thought of them higher than the game he wanted to make, in a way. And what he got is a kick to the face just when he came up with a project that *he* wanted to make, instead of making Utaha come up with most of the plot, as per her expectations - a producer should be able to demand his \"assets\" to meet/surpass his vision/expectations, which is the essence of his new project: he finally *knows* what he wanted to make. He finally came up with tons of pages for his proposal, which is a MASSIVE improvement from how he started in the very first episode of S1. And yet that, that whole fucking episode is what he got as a reply. Heck, if he knew the game helped them get scouted for a massive project immediately, going by his characterization he and some of us fans who share the same sentiment probably would've reacted differently (without regard to the author's shenanigans)\n\nI enjoyed my time with Utaha around prior to this, Eriri whatever, but by the Goddess Katou Megumi I shall now commit myself as a devout believer of Her Holiness.\n\nIn all seriousness, If you think I'm in for the harem or I'm just a simple minded shipper, no, I'm fine with this ending with whichever girl as long as it's handled well. Not to say this episode was executed like garbage, but fuck the way Utaha and Eriri handled it was infuriating.      "

All he had in his mind was the hesitation between her future exploits as a writer versus continuing to work on his next game, either one followed by college life. Add in the sense of reservation Tomoya might have working with 2 excellent talents being an amateur himself. And then it escalated even further with all that ep 7 and 8, and finally the next game which is obviously made for Megumi. I thought at that point it should be pretty clear how he feels about Utaha, but of course, according to you, she had to make her last hurrah.\nWhat makes me furious is that not just they (Utaha & Eriri) had to go to that extent to destroy Tomoya, but also Megumi since to this point it's yet to even be hinted that they involved Megumi in the decision as a fellow member of the circle.\")\n\nAlso you might want to edit it, 2 new lines just break spoiler tag.\n\n"

He didn't push Utaha and Eriri to their limits to improve. But this woman will; in these terms, she's a much better producer than Aki. Not only is this a super big project that will bring them money and fame, they both know their skills will drastically improve from working on this project. \n\n> For a culture that always goes on about dignity this seems to make no sense whatsoever.\n\nIn what way are you using the term dignity here? If you mean dignity as an individual, I don't think that's quite right. Many japanese salarymen work absolutely ridiculous hours to the point of fatigue, death, or suicide. Workers don't clock out until their boss clocks out. Workers tend to stay with the same company all their lives out of loyalty. Japan is most definitely a culture with a greater emphasis on the community, rather than the individual.

They weren't part of that company yet. They had no feelings of loyalty or whatsoever to Akane and her rant. It was a job offer they got invited to, not because they were looking for work themselves but because someone wanted them, or well wanted one and the other one as a freebie. You basically had a stranger yelling degenerating stuff at you, while she was the one making the offer. \n\nTo me this was a horrible episode because it made no sense whatsoever. If they portrayed Akane as a stern, experienced worker that treated them normally and made them that offer, this episode would've made a lot more sense already, but as it stands no.

   "text": "> that was a bigger dick move from them than Tomoya ever did\n\nAlright, I don't see how this episode can be put in these terms at all.\n\nIn the first place, neither Utaha nor Eriri knew that Tomoya wanted to make a new game. From their perspective, it was possible (and Eriri definitely saw it as a likelihood) but Tomoya never brought anything to them until he showed Utaha the proposal this episode. You can also say that he was leaving them hanging by not having mentioned anything about the Circle's future after completing the first game.\n\n> I would rather work on my own game, with people I like than for an abusive asshole just to be successful\n\nThis is missing the point. Utaha and Eriri did not make anything of their own in the first game. They brought Tomoya's ideas to life, and they were asked to do so for Akane.\n\nThey aren't doing it to become more successful. They as creators want to work in an environment that will push their skills to the limit, and Tomoya wasn't providing it to them (delaying deadlines for Eriri, asking Utaha to provide the minimum amount of work).\n\nAt the point of when Tomoya was talking to Utaha this episode, it was a choice between working on a project that promised to be challenging (Akane) vs. working with a much smaller scale project in which the producer (Tomoya) already planned to look for resources other than the two, thereby giving them even less influence on how the final product will be like."

He mentioned it several times when talking to them, but didn't want to put too much pressure on them, because he wasn't sure if they still want to make a new game with college coming up.\n\nThe big problem is, that neither of them really talked about it. Tomoya, because he feared they would reject him and because he felt guilty for pushing them too hard. Meanwhile, the girls were somehow expecting from him to come up with a new project and pushing them into working on it (that how it feels to me).\n\n>This is missing the point. Utaha and Eriri did not make anything of their own in the first game.\n\nIt cleary didn't came out as the game Tomoyo expecting it to be. They remade the story a few times and clearly all worked together on the several aspects of the game. Tomoya maybe had the idea first, but what came out at the end really wasn't *his* game.\n\nWorking with a big group on a RPG cleary isn't the same. I'm pretty much sure, that your not nearly as involved in the game development process as you are in a doujin circle. Personally, I would always prefer the doujin circle above the big scale production, but that's just my opinion.\n\n>They as creators want to work in an environment that will push their skills to the limit, and Tomoya wasn't providing it to them\n\nYeah, but at some point it just isn't healthy anymore. I think Tomoya was already pushing them pretty much during their first game. Just afterwards, after Eriri became sick, he started to act \"softer\" towards them, because he felt guilty.\n\nA producer who wants you to put your life on the line for a game is crazy. There are reasons, why Japans working culture is criticized so often and that's one of them. Pushing their skills to the limit and intentionally demanding ridiculous things makes a difference and I feel like Akane is someone who demand the later. \n\n>which the producer (Tomoya) already planned to look for resources other than the two, thereby giving them even less influence on how the final product will be like.\n\nAgain, that's because they never talked about what to do from now on and he felt guilty.\n"

They will also be contributing a lot to the Akane's game should they commit to doing so, because Eriri was offered the position of Character Designer and Utaha is going to be writing an actual scenario. We can make all sorts of assumptions about how it will play out, but these are definitely the top positions for creative freedom for their respective crafts (drawing and writing) in a game development project.\n* It's up to their choice what work culture they want to take part in.

Tomoya was upset in the moment (he seemed more distraught about Eriri, with whom he had a *very* close relationship with at this point), but probably would have gotten over it quickly because they had their creative needs. He would have just given up on the next project for now. But he was never told anything until the moment he had gained momentum and needed them. His friends not only turned their backs on him, but failed to talk to him at all.\n\nMaybe it's karma for his oversight over Megumi the year before, but in some ways this is worse: they intentionally didn't say a word, knowing he would be hurt.\n\nUtaha was correct. Tomoya isn't a creator and is a bad producer, but that's why he values friendship over artistry, just like Megumi. Yes, Eriri and Utaha have their reasons, but I totally get why Tomoya was disappointed."

They know it's wrong but they aren't strong or brave enough to bring themselves to do it. \n\nThis is their demon they must wrestle with and like in real life, they'll either learn from it and grow as people, or repeat the same mistakes in the future. \n\nBut no one learns life lessons overnight. \n\nSo the girls wait, pushing off the unwanted 'talk' that no one wants to have, until it finally reaches the point of no return. In the scene where she finally breaks the news to Tomoya, Utaha must have been both tense but also relieved, because the choice has been made for her. She can finally tell Tomoya because she _needs_ to now. \n\nFor all the adult, professional faces they put on both around each other and strangers, our main cast consists of very young students who have only gotten a small taste of what it's like to be involved in complex relationships where friendship, business, and yes, romance, all intertwine and interact with and upon each other.  \n\nI think this is an excellent point in the writing here that really brings out the earnest youth in our characters out. They're all roiling balls of potential, talent, and emotions. It's only natural they can't make the optimal, most rational choice 100% of the time and get everything right. \n\nThat's a part of being human and more importantly, a part of growing up. "

That's going to be an interesting conflict when she finds out...\n\nThis episode also highlighted what I said from the last episode about Eriri not finding inspiration herself and instead seeking it out from someone else. Utaha also got that treatment as well, since the biggest reason she left Blessing Software was because Eriri left, so that must mean that Eriri took the offer before Utaha did. I understand that creators need people to push them, but once again, when that's your major reason for why you need to create and not because you want do it because you love it, then your reasons for being a creator becomes an issue and it won't be a surprise when your projects are flat and unoriginal, and in that kind of context, Aki is a better producer than Akane, since he allows them to use their talents to their own beat so that they can enjoy creating for everyone to enjoy. \n\nIn short, because they always need someone to push them to do better and not find that spark to better themseleves by themselves, Utaha and Eriri can get lost when no one is leading them, and thus, they're not true creators.\n\nAlso, yeah, I said it: Aki is better than Akane!

During the graduation scene, she said do you want a one night-stand? should I change into date clothes or maybe we can make more memory in our school clothes...   \n\nNow if a beautiful smart girl offers her first time with you, knowing this is the final farewell, she is doing this because she really loves you, not to shackle you into a relationship by sleeping with you.\n\nIn term of what many perceived as Utaha's betrayal to Tomo this eposide, Utaha did it intentionally to make Tomo hates her.   Utaha cried because Tomo didn't react like what many \"normal\" men here are doing, calling her a traitor,  cold-heart career bitch that sacrifice love relationship when an opportunity arise.   You see, Utaha is so head-over-heel in love with Tomo, she just can't leave this \"abusive\" one-side relationship on her own.  The logical side of Utaha knows this, that is why she intentionally hide the news for a month so Tomo can blow up and say hurtful words.  Those hurtful words would have convince the in-love Utaha side, its time to move on.\n\nIs this turn of event sudden?  It's actually not.   Last eposide, when Kato asks Aki \"are you sure if it's okay that you are this focus on me?\"   \"Are you going to confess to Utaha-Senpai to bring her back to produce 2nd game?\"   \"Utaha Senpai will be going to University, will she have the time to work on the 2nd project?\"   If you look at Aki face expression,  he did not look surprised that Kato said Utaha Sendai is hoping to hear Aki-kun's decision.   Will Utaha has any hope in reciprocal love feeling from Aki? In a way Utaha is begging Aki, just say NO and let her go.  She just can't stand the pain of being repeatly shoot down any longer.   Aki has refused to give Utaha a clear response in eposide 0, 00, 3, and last time in ep 4 when Utaha cried in bath before undress and laid in Aki's bed naked for 2 hours.   Her arms covering her eyes crying silently.  Now many saw that scene as a comedy fan service but it's actually a very important lead to this eposide event.\n\n  Does Aki has any feeling for Utaha?  I think he does have some feeling, if Aki has no feeling then he would not have ask Utaha to stay in a nearby University instead the better University far away.  Of course it's one of those mixed signals that Utaha hopes to hear but not sure what Aki meant.  Aki also seem to enjoy being with Utaha as long as Utaha is not in sexual heat mode.  Utaha is just behind Kato in term of staying over night at Aki's and Go out on dates.  \n\nThis anime is so good because you can't just consume it like otaku pigs that just read the sub and watch the anime in fast motion then make review comments that it's good ugly or crappy eposide.  The goodie stuff is the character's emotions underneath the spoken words.   Just like the good part last ep. Kato told Aki \"you think I have feeling for you?\"  In that blank dagger stare.  Next part \"after what you did to me all this time?\"     The cutest part is in the last min when Kato was laying in bed and kicking her feet, \"don't blame me for what will happen\" hinting at today's ep.  Everyone in this anime have more depth and intelligence than what is shown, with the exception of Eiriri whose charm is being young and ignorant.  \n\nSpoiler:  I think Kato as the nice waifu will make Aki go save Utaha.\n"

   "text": "This episode felt like everything was going wrong for all the worst reasons. \n\nYes, Tomoya lacks the guts to be a real leader. What makes him a nice person makes him a bad producer. The only person he's willing to shove his opinions and commands on is Katou. Sometimes you have to be willing to make your creatives do their shit, [even if it means not letting them go home.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHxthsaLpbI)\n\nOn the other hand, in a separate situation this development would've been completely fine. Utaha and Eriri get some big offers. That's great. Ideally, they'd accept, be successful, Tomoya would be happy for them, and then maybe in the future they could meet up again in the field and work together. Instead, due to the already tense relationship at play, it all gets painted in a bad light.\n\nAtleast there's still Katou though right? That's what truly matters. (Maybe Michiru's band members can draw...)"

She easily imitated Eriri's most prized art style, so there is a level of professional respect / deference the girls showed to her.

We couldn't just have the same characters with largely unchanged dynamics making yet another game together. We've played that out and doing it again would just be beating a dead horse. It might be nice to get Utaha and Eriri offscreen for a while, have Tomoya stop idolizing them, and see what he and Megumi can manage together as amateurs without established figures to carry them. It'd also be nice if other characters like Michiru, Izumi, and even Iori got shuffled to the fore for some much-needed development. "

   "text": "This is a late reply and anybody that should see this won't, but...\n\nI see a bunch of people complaining about how the girls \"betrayed\" Aki like this is some grandiose NTR or whatever.\n\nPeople are treating this like the other characters have to be devoted to Aki just because he's the MC. Everyone wants to treat Utaha and Eriri as harem members that should just fall in line behind the man they can't win. That is so fucked up that so many people have this line of reasoning.\n\nThe breadcrumbs have been out there for a while. I mean it's been drilled to us some of last season, and all of this season that Aki was a horrible producer. He kept at odds with himself about friendship or producer that he never really pushed them to achieve what they are really capable of. While at the same time pushing them away as he tried to take on things by himself and not communicating. Creating their game was an entire shit show, and if they didn't have the talent of Utaha and Eriri, it would have fallen on its face.\n\nAnd right before the deadline of the game, Eriri goes through her shit by forcing herself into a corner. She was able to push herself to create what she thought of as her best art yet. (which we see after this episode that her best art yet means nothing to someone who is a true master of their craft, and it was imitated as if it was a simple work)  Aki had almost nothing to do with it. In fact, he only messes things up by showing up and staying with her for that extended period of time. As we know her conflicting feelings put her in a slump state. \n\nAki won't push her, and Eriri won't push herself anymore because she doesn't want to worry Aki who has sort of started paying more attention to her. Utaha sees and notices all of this and worries for her friend Eriri because she doesn't want her talent to go to waste and or die.\n\nMeanwhile Aki has really only been half paying any attention to those two. He hasn't really started on a new game proposal, hasn't told anyone he plans on making another game, and is super fixated on getting Katou back as his friend. Getting to Katou has probably been Aki's number one priority since winter comiket. Winter Comiket takes place at the end of December, and we know that Katou actively avoids Aki for like two months. We know that it basically gets to Valentines day by the time Aki puts into action his plan at getting Katou back. Remember Iori warns Aki here to not lose Utaha and Eriri. Context from this episode says that Iori knows what his older sister Akane is planning, and is pseudo warning Aki. Which mostly goes over his head, because, again, he only has one person on his mind right now.\n\nSo it's after Valentines day that Aki even begins work on a new game, and when he starts his proposal he even says to himself that their previous one was just going to be a one time thing. He himself didn't know that he was going to do another game, and during the time he's coming up with this, Akane has either already talked to the other two, or is just about to talk to them. Aki truly only goes through with the proposal because he wants to use it as a way to get back in the good graces of Katou, at least that's how I see it.\n\nSo yea maybe as friends the other two could have told Aki what they were recruited for, but I don't think they really had any true obligation to do it. Any time Aki could have spent working on a new proposal, or building the relationship as a producer for his creatives was wasted because he obsessed over Katou. He stopped pushing Eriri at all, even letting her go over two months on a simple thank you illustration. In my mind, Aki did all of this to himself, and if he really turns what Utaha and Eriri are doing into some sort of NTR back stabbing, it would only feed into his own selfishness. He can't continue to push and pull on them at the same time and just expect everything to be ok when he ignores them for two months while he chases after another person."

   "text": "> I mean, both girls are creators, so yeah they NEED to keep pushing themselves to improve otherwise they stagnate. But he didnt push them because he was worried about their health or something else?\n\nDifferent people are motivated by different things.  Some people work better with encouragement, some people work better with a kick in the ass.  SaeKano seems to be taking the direction that an artist needs to be challenged to produce their best work.  Prior to finishing the game, Utaha criticized him for not challenging Eriri and being willing to just accept her work as is without pushing boundaries.  And after the release, he didn't want to overwork either of them for their next project.  Eriri because of her health, Utaha because she had college as well as her own projects.  That's how I interpreted it at least.\n\nThat being said, I don't really agree.  The people who are in contention for the greatest of all time - the Michael Jordans and the Beethovens of the world - generally have a lot of intrinsic motivation.  A desire to push to new heights even when others think they've already reached the summit.  And even among people  who aren't at those lofty heights, there are still lots of people who have plenty of self-motivation and/or a desire to keep improving themselves.  Also, you don't need to work someone to death to get the best results out of them; quite frankly it may very well be counterproductive because there's a very good chance an overworked, sleep-deprived person will just produce crap.\n\n> Lets pretend they told him in the same day they received the proposal from Kosaka, what would be correct?\n\nThey should give him a chance to make a counteroffer and he should respect the choice that they ultimately make.  But in the end, it's their lives and their careers and thus their right to leave.  I think it's a false dichotomy that they can only improve if he gives them a periodic kick in the ass but if that's how they feel, that's their prerogative.\n\n> End of doujin team, what happens to the producer Tomoya?\n\nI can't speak for what happens in the LNs but I personally think that if he was really that committed to creating his vision, it doesn't have to be with Utaha and Eriri specifically.  Development teams change all the time and people don't usually have the luxury of working with their \"dream team\"."

   "text": "A little late to the party but we'll see how many people see this.\n\nI see and understand a lot of the arguments that are in some ways playing Devil's advocate, that this is a \"better opportunity\" for the girls.\n\nWhile I most certainly agree that a better opportunity to continue dreams and careers is almost *always* the right choice, I have to wonder...is it really okay to pursue that at the cost of your true friendships and love? We romanticize about never giving up on your career over a love interest, but we often forget it's very possible to make them both align. Did they really have to do this work sneaking around? The fact they had to keep quiet about it in the first place is testament that they know they were doing something downright shitty and destructive.\n\nNow there are certainly valid counterarguments to that. However, let's go a bit further: is a \"lifetime opportunity\" actually worth it if you have to abandon your enjoyment and respect to do so? Certainly Aki should have been harder on his creators in terms of pushing them in a clear direction by some regards, but by the same time the complete and utter freedom allowed the two of them to grow without bound for as long as they did. People were saying about how goddamned much the two of them improved, more than under any other \"normal\" work constraints. In a sense, they are disposing of themselves to \"die\" for a project. They are deleting themselves as human beings so the content they put out is of a high quality...a quality that might not even feel valuable to a creator. They are deleting their relationships they had built up and betraying the person who cared for and believed in them most, and built them up more than anyone else before. Using him as an object, if you will.\n\nThe statement that people need to be pressured in order to make better work is a cornerstreet myth. Some of the best creatives in the world were trained/trained by someone who gave them creative freedom and let them flow. You dont need to hate your job to get good at it. Of course struggle is important, but what struggle is good struggle and what is simply suffering for a false cause? For creators, the moment you detach yourself from your work is the beginning of the end of it.\n\nNow having thought about that, was this actually a \"better opportunity\"?"

I don't understand the **You don't push us harder that's why we cant grow as creators** bullshit. \n\n\n\nJust like what you said Isn't actually the contrary for **Talented Individuals** to want freedom about their work, does this mean that Utaha and Eriri are not really **Talented Individuals** in a sense that they need confirmation and supervision from a higher authority ? I mean Its almost like they are the types that need to go to some Fine Arts School to get the confirmation that they are indeed \"Good\", If you are trully a \"God tier\" talent I believe its someone that prefer not to be bound by rules and expectations from other people just like you said \"Some of the best creatives in the world were trained/trained by someone who gave them creative freedom and let them flow\".\n\n\n\nSo again maybe both of the girls are not that really Talented specifically **\"God tier\"** as the series tries to portray them?"

A project like that is just an amazing chance and anyone would be crazy not to go for it. It's an opportunity to prove yourself on (what was presented as) a huge scale after which they'd both pretty much have their pick of projects to work on forever.\n\nEriri clearly needed a kick, and Akane seems the person to give it to her. Evidently her takeaway from the circle, even subconsciously, was that Tomoyo will be there for her regardless of what she does and that lack of pressure is killing her ability to work. A demanding project that stretches her ability to draw is so much better for her than what appears to be, at least from an art point of view, a pretty generic dating sim. She maybe should have told him earlier, but then he hadn't asked her yet about continuing with the circle so its easy to see why she may not have brought it up.\n\nAt the end of the day the doujin world basically exists as a feeder and place for professionals to practise.

She even told him she was going to focus on her career and made that perfectly clear. She said she wasn't coming to school anymore because she wanted to focus on her books. Why would any viewer assume she would just hang around waiting in Tomoya's group - of course she'd look for other jobs.\n\nBetrayal? Hardly. Tomoya was doing his own thing, following his own dreams of making another game and so was Utaha following her own dreams of career advancement (and working with Eriri if possible). She's not just some legendary writer you can summon at will when you need her for your game. Utaha already made her position clear many times so she doesn't really owe an explanation at all. Maybe Eriri but not Utaha. Utaha never said she'd work with Tomoya on his next game, even when Tomoya asked. Sometimes I feel like people are just not following very well."

A giant middle finger to the viewers honestly.\n\n\"Oh, remember how we started out the show with the basis on expanding upon the characters to keep the viewers engaged instead of relying on bullshit scenarios that require people doing head-heel turn with zero justification? In fact, why don't we name the show 'How to make a boring heroine' because that exactly the theme of the goddamnn show? Well, we just decided to FUCK THAT ALL, CYA SCRUBS\"\n\nI'm not even mad about the choices the heroines made, even. There needed to be zero drama involved in this entire episode.\n\nUtaha, before taking the manuscript that Aki hands her, just says \"Sorry, but I'm working on different project with Eriri, so I won't be able to do this\" because it makes sense both as a professional and a friend. (and this is even assuming things actually get to the 11th hour. Situation could have been resolved at any time from a month ago to this point)\n\nAki, who is admittedly shocked, recovers (although not fully) because he realizes he's not the most important little shithead in the world (because he already knew that from past 20 or so episodes of realizing they were both above his head and recognizing the fact that other circles were eyeing them) and goes \"Oh shucks, well that blows, could've told me sooner y'know. Well this makes things awkward\"\n\nUtaha goes \"Well I could still read this for you\" and reaches for the manuscript because she feels bad but Aki goes \"ya... no. I guess now i have ton of time to improve on this so I'll take it with me for now\" because he feels hurt (just because he understands doesn't mean he's not hurt)\n\nThe episode ends with Aki sitting in front of his laptop with the file open, not typing a single thing. The phone starts vibrating and of course it's eriri, but he doesn't pick it up, curls his fingers up into a fist on his keyboard and starts crying softly because he's a little crybaby.\n\nWow, look, the episode doesn't make your stomach literally turn from distaste and maybe you feel some sort of genuine sadness for the protagonist. Maybe once my stomach calms down from this garbage being sent down my memory hole, I'll check out the LN and see if the execution is as distasteful as the anime adaptation."

By genre, it is a high school rom-com / pseudo-harem show, and quite a successful one based on the first season, that's why the majority of the fanbase are here for the girls and humor.  At the same time, the author being a galgame industry veteran, is quite a bit more ambitious than an average LN writer.  He takes delight in injecting more drama, humanizing his flawed but still likable characters and commenting on the creative nature of anime/game industry.  Part of the Saekano fanbase does appreciate this aspect of the show, but they are in the minorities.  This is why when the plot gets more intense, you will likely witness very polarizing opinions.\n\nA trivia: the author once joked that his editor warned him from the start to aim for an audience half the age of his previous readership.  He went \"you seriously want me to write for 9 year olds??\" (he used to write 18+ galgames)  His editor shot back \"you didn't know your average readership used to be 30 year olds??\"  Jokes aside, I don't think he is entirely successful in switching to a new audience - no one can seriously think Saekano is strictly aimed at 15 year olds.

And there's also the other major conflict - when Aki rushed to Eriri when she collapsed without telling Megumi, even though she already said to him that she \"will come with him, even if it's to Eriri's villa\" that was basically out of town (forgot the exact location name), she was mad and didn't talk to him for... however long it was (forgot) until Aki manned up and approached her. Shows how much she cares about him and the circle.\n\n> In the first place, if she can't draw or write the script, what is her job in blessing soft? I kinda though she was the character model and VA for the game.\n\nHer job in Blessing Software is basically well, part general assistant part heroine model/VA, though for Cherry Blessing, their first game, I... think the neither of the heroines ended up being *largely* based on her (or her character's charm as this \"boring girl\")? There were 3 girls in the game I think, 1 being Utaha's self insert, the little sister, and Megumi's heroine. It was this 2nd game, self-titled \"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata\", where Aki finally realized his initial vision of the girl he met on that downhill road, with Megumi being the base for the main heroine, and based on his feelings towards Megumi from the very first day up to that point. \n\nThe other significant difference so far in the anime/manga for me is that Cherry Blessing started with Aki understanding very little about how his ideas as a producer/director matter a lot more than he thought (when he came to Utaha with that shabby... or even crappy base idea on a single piece of loose leaf), while Utaha worked most of the script with Aki joining only for the last route, while for \"Saenai Heroine no Sodatekata\" he was finally able to put together a proper proposal which he seriously put his heart in.\n\nWhich finally brings us to this latest episode's shitstorm."

After all, he REALLY cared for her when she worked her butt off and was trying to mend their fractured friendship from the past. However, after seeing Eriri go and try to stop Utaha from leaving and leaves herself to pursue a career, (which is understandable) but waits a literally a month knowing that Tomoya will be devastated is terrible because she knows Tomoya is slaving over a new proposal. Sure the argument could be made that no one wants to be the bearer of bad news, but Eriri and Utata both shared the burden, it's easier to break the bad news together than on her own. Even that, she forced Utaha to tell Tomoya. So after this, I really really hope that Tomoya just shuts his relationship down with Eriri. He deserves much more from a friend. "

Utaha now looks to take the throne away from Eriri, as she desperately tries to prove herself, while Eriri has just been told her art is great, but easily imitated. She needs to get over the slump, and also find an identity in her art. Akane is saying she can bring those two together and bring them both out, so Megumi and Tomoya needs to go above and beyond."
