Love how they even talked about the DVD/BD sales of the show. I wish they've gone full meta and just flat out said the actual sales numbers for S1. That kind of information is already public anyway.\n\nThe scene in Tomoya's room is obviously a direct continuation of S1's ending, as evidenced by Eriri's harisen lying on the floor. The same harisen she used to slap Tomoya before the S1's final episode ended. The pool scene though, I'm curious if that chronologically takes place after at the end of S2 or if it does happen in order.\n\nEverything is solid. This is the Saekano I know. Top notch music, art, and animation. I just wish someone else picked this up and not Amazon :<"

The author of the series is better known for his White Album 2 fame, one of the highest regarded romantic drama, so if he chooses to he can definitely deliver solid writing."
