I kind of like the OP and ED, but they're nowhere as good as OreImo's were. Sagiri is being a little bit tsun and a little bit dere. The LN writer, bookstore girl, classmate of Sagiri and the LN editor woman are all going to be in Masamune-kun's harem? This is like OreImo all over again! Who would've though, am I right?\n\n[](#kukuku)[](#rinkek)[](#smuglancer)"

The whole \"Girls my age all love Dicks\" was pretty tasteless and subtlety definitely isn't a part of this show. I could hardly laugh nor not get excited by a 'joke' like that and it just was weird in the end. The brother judging prez-chan for liking One Piece was kind of nice, although it was also pretty clear otaku pandering. This show is weirdly sexual, but that's to be expected I suppose. Kind of ruined the supposed adorableness of Prez-chan though. This show could be a lot cuter and more funny if it wasn't so tactlessly sexual, but I suppose that's a personal preference.\n\nThat was one of the most Otaku-baity episodes I've seen. Hell, it was even more otakubaity than OreImo. Every girl in this show is a sex-obsessed otaku loli who falls for the MC. It's so deliberately trying to write the suppsoed otaki dream, but I suppose that's the purpose of the show. Still pretty moe though."

Look around in different threads and you'll notice different people participating.  Know your audience.  The people who condemns these types of shows are most likely not going to be watching these shows and participating here unless they're doing a 3 episode rule like you are.\n\n>Shows like EroSensei are the reason the \"anime was a mistake\" meme exists and as long as they somehow keep selling, there's no way we'll get more serious or creative series without an mc who screams like he had some kind of mental disorder every time he gets teased or something went wrong.\n\nTrue and I understand the gripe you have with the lack of really serious or creative series.  I get how it can piss you off.  That's how the demand is right now over there.  Regardless, those types of shows you're looking for are still being produced but not in abundance as you like.  Gotta tolerate that, man.  You'll get over that frustration and get used to it.  Anyways, there's room for everything and that's what make anime pretty neat.  \n\nThis show clearly ain't for you.  Good luck with finding shows that will please you.\n\nI'll be staying here as this show ended up as a guilty pleasure lol."

I'd at the very least keep an eye on this series\n- [Grimoire of Zero](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34176/Zero_kara_Hajimeru_Mahou_no_Sho) is a fairly by the numbers fantasy adventure but the interactions bwtween the 2 main characters have made the 1st episode very enjoyable so far. Definitely worth checking out\n- [SukaSuka](https://myanimelist.net/anime/33502/Shuumatsu_Nani_Shitemasu_ka_Isogashii_desu_ka_Sukutte_Moratte_Ii_desu_ka) is another series with strong fantasy vibes, this time way darker and dramatic (although not melodramatic). The series is very likely to adapt the entire story in its 12 episode runtime, so if you like the premise and conclusive endings, this show is one of the more promising series so far in this season\n- I'm also watching [Renai Boukun](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32262/Renai_Boukun) but I don't know if I will keep watching. If you like over the top comedy, this series might be worth checking out"
