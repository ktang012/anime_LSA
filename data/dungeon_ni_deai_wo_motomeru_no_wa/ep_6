In book Aiz was constantly dancing on the edge, almost collapsed because of mind down. The whole scene was supposed to break the image of the invincible Aiz, the whole fight was a feat [Danmachi Oratoria](/s \"Which was the reason she levelled up by the way\"). Bell's fight against minotaur was awesome, why does this one have to be this bad? Where's the suspension, where's the struggle?\n\nHere we have the usual pew pew OHKO, floor boss which is farmable piece of shit and bad camera angles. Way to go. \n\nNot to mention the whole character development is gone as well. [Danmachi Oratoria](/s \"The lappillow scene made Aiz realize how to proceed further without being corrupted by a thirst for power\"). Somehow I'm not surprised, the studio responsible for the adaptation trapped themselves in the lighthearted comedy theme and it backfires again (the murder case in the previous episodes was poorly made because the sudden serious atmosphere would stick out like a sore thumb) and I'm 100% sure it will backfire yet again [Danmachi Oratoria](/s \"rogue families killing adventurers anyone? Ahaha, just a minor event, they only killed the whole elite, almost made the whole Orario collapse aaaaand have a fanservice moment with Lefiya, just in case you start thinking we finally get serious\")\n\nThere's one good thing. Bell's reaction.\n\nRequesting gif :3"

I guess not havimg expectations since episode 1 and not reading ln is peobably helping :D\n\nHowever even I can agree that the amount of time that could have been spares in the first few episodes is quite insane. Hopefully it was budget constraints and that's going to go elsewhere. I mean they still have to so the deepest dungeon explore attempt feo. Danmachi. "
