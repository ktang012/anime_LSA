Plot develops fast. Thought I honestly expected Guri to just make another kiss note by coloring with black marker a plain old notebook."

I'm a sucker for imouto arcs.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat said, overall, I'm really in love with the character art for this show.  Seiji, Guri, Akane, and Akua have some of the most attractive designs I've seen to date.  Their expressions, their vibrant color palettes, their multi-tinted hair, their matching eye & hair colors (blue with blue, red with red, purple with purple)...the show really does an excellent job making each character memorable.  \n\n&nbsp;\n \n(Especially in the color matching sense, they remind me of Akari and Multi from \"To Heart\") "

Guri is just straight up adorable and so much fun, and I love how the show just turns up every shitty character trope up to eleven with Akane and Loli. It makes a joke about every bad Romance trope out there by just exaggerating the hell out of it, and it makes it so much fun to watch. I never expected to even like this show, but it's turning out to be pretty damn fun."

This episode had some quiet moments, the first two were more over-the-top, but it was still funny, made laugh a lot, especially with the random demon penguin, the lack of any logical explanation makes it better.\n\nOMG, the scene with the guy and his harem, just to show us how a plot armor works and that just the MC can have a harem. Actually now that I think about it, is this really HIS harem? Because the relationship seems to be all-sided. Also, the burnt Kiss Note! And the faces! Guri reacting later was a nice touch.\n\nYuri kiss? Yeah, that's what this anime was missing, but I wasn't expecting Guri to do that ~~fits with her, tho~~. Poor Yuzu, she just wants her onee-sama. And now we got a sadist, that's going to be... Interesting, to say the least. Really looking forward to this show, and probably the manga is next in my list!"

The moment Akane sees Aino she goes full speed and the teacher is like \"Yeah!, that's what I'm talking about!\". I don't remember if it where the teacher or some news people trying to get some declarations on her, but the joke is that she indeed can run fast, it is just that there is a lot more elaboration.\n\nAnd like that there are a lot more jokes and fun situations that are pretty elaborated.
