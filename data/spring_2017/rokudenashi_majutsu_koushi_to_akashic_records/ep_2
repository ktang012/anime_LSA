I will probably get a lot of hate for this but **SAO** is one of the best, if not the best adaptation of a LN I have ever seen. 4 cours (50 episodes) adapted 8 volumes and the pacing was great when you compare it to the actual source material. Although the source material itself was shit at times thus some parts of the anime was bad as well. But **SAO** will get a complete anime adaptation. Soon the Alicization arc of the light novels, best arc to date IMO will get an adaptation as well.\n\nAnother example would be **Re:Zero** which will probably also get a full adaptation and White Fox did their best (skipping opening and endings) to no rush it. Although some parts were rushed, it was a pretty good adaptation still. If we go by volume count it adapted 8 volumes into 25 episodes(but the episodes were extra long).\n\n\nThere is also **Monogatari series** which will also probably get a full adaption but I haven't read the source material yet so I can't tell how good of an adaptation it was.\n\nAlso this season's **Zero kara Hajimeru Mahou no Sho** adapts 1 LN volume (I think) into 12 episodes. But I have neither read the LN nor seen the anime so there is not much I can tell."

This wouldn't bring in as much profit as making a rushed adaption. That is because when the adaptation is somewhat rushed and skips a lot of content, people will start reading the novels from the beginning. While if you had made a 1:1 adaptation, consumers would start reading where the anime left off. As a LN reader myself this is something that I can relate too. When I watched the second season of SAO, and found out it was an accurate adaptation, I just continued reading where the anime left off(volume 9). But that wasn't the case for let's say \"High School DxD\" which was a pretty shitty adaptation so I started reading from volume 1. \n\n Making a 1:1 adaptation is only great idea if you are planing to make a complete adaptation.

Be it a VN, LN, manga or anime. And 99% of the time the best version is the source material. The manga adaptation of Code Geass original anime wasn't as great as the anime. The anime adaptation of Steins;Gate VN isn't as great as the VN. I try to find the best version of the story and consume it that way. Then go ahead and watch/read the other, less-canon versions.\n\nMost light novel adaptations are quite rushed and skip a lot so it is 9 of 10 times not a good idea to jump from one to the other if you really want to enjoy the story. But if you don't have time to read, then you can go with the fastest way of consuming a story although there is no guarantee it is the best version. It also depends how much time it takes you to finish a volume. Finishing 6 episodes of High School DXD takes about 2 hours while finishing 1 volume of the LN which corresponds to those 6 episodes takes double that time."

So this is why we have so many anime that don't get an S2, end at weird points, etc. "

So why isn't he way more badass than he is in the show? I feel like an assassin would be way more skilled than Glenn is, and most of the situations where he is in trouble were easily avoidable and seems to be just an excuse for a fanservice style rescue from Sisti. \n\nHe just seems so incapable for someone who is constantly hinted as being a badass. I feel like the show would be loads better if he had a two forms kind of badassery and baffoon in the way Vash from Trigun did. The way he is in the show comes off as annoying more often than amazing. This episode just sort of reinforces that for me even more.\n\nIs his portrayal different in the Manga?\n\nWhat are you guys thoughts?"
