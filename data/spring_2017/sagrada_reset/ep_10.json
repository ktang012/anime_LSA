The subs translate Asai's words as \"You won't take action unless you want an ability\" but I'm guessing it should actually be something like \"your ability won't act unless you want it to\" (anyone fluent in Japanese want to check?).  \n\nIn the second fight nobody had died (yet) so when Murase said \"Full body.

When you can remember every single thing that happens in your life with 100% accuracy you start to see how imperfect society is and distance yourself from it (they literally give justification for his warped personality in the 2nd ep).  And when you can turn back time 3 days and develop a reflex of doing it when ever you feel sadness, only causing you to experience that sadness regardless you start to lose sense of time and yourself dulling your emotions.  Basically they have issues, and they are trying to help each other get over them by using thier combined powers to help people and try to right the world a little.

It's done on purpose, they literally have Chuunibyou. It's a messed up town, with no intervention from outside. What would happen if a Chuunibyou kid actually had supernatural powers? And powers that can let your mind fly thinking of how to use them. Murase is the best example of this behavior: She wants to destroy The System (Boreau) using her powers, because she is the only one capable of that, she thinks of herself as *special*, and actually being special doesn't help. But when time comes to take a life... Well, you saw what happened. This theory could perfectly explain why everyone seems so unnatural, it's simply because **they're not human**, a kid with powers grows up differently, and it seems the Boreau it's doing a really bad job about this issue. This is why I want to believe the protagonists sound so lifeless, because they're, those kids saw some shit, but they have feelings, just not in the same way we have ours (this can be observed in Asai's death, Misora had her usual deadpan, but cried at last).\n\nThe mixed up information is also part of this, It's been a while since an anime made us think so much, in a really messed up way, and I like that.\n\n**Best episode so far, waiting for more.**"

Sucking a little information should have been harmless, but because Minami Mirai (twintails) had the ability to retain information post-death (i.e. become a ghost) he misjudged his feeding level and accidentally killed her.  \n\nThat's why Murase felt responsible for Minami's death, and why she attacked Asai Kei (MC) and Haruki Misora to force a reset.  \n\nThough it looked as if Murase had used her ability to protect herself from the reset (she says: \"Full body. Ability.\" before Haruki resets), Asai notes that she nevertheless forgot what happened to Minami and deduces that this is because she didn't really want to remember what happened so she actually let the reset wipe her memory.

Also apart from the few tears, Haruki just standing there like part of the scenery is another reason. I think most people would have had some sort of a reaction to something like that no matter what she might have known beforehand. Or her robot like rules are so ingrained she has no reflexes. Very weird but I like the mystery so far, hopefully it will keep getting better and start making more sense."
