I never expected to say that i missed the generic stories from the 90s rpgs, funny. I agree with the ending, but as i say i think is to be expected from this kind of story, the second episode has been out since january if you want to watch it, Bahamut is basically the ''summon'' of the girl, a la final fantasy."

In Shingeki no bahamut Zeus, Odin and Satan managed to seal Bahamut before he''resets'' the world, in the process Zeus died and leads to the events of the anime\n\nGranBlue fantasy is an alternative universe where Zeus didn't make it to completely seal Baha, so the dragon managed to wipe the world (thats why in this show the earth is destroyed and people is living in floating islands) and thats also why Bahamut haves a blindfold and his arms tied, he got half-sealed, and thats also the reason of why he needs to be summoned, because he is not free, he helps Lyria because i think the soul of Lyria is connected with Bahamut, so if she dies, Bahamut haves no way to being summoned.\n\n If you watch the episode again you will hear how the baddie says ''you are escaping with that ''thing'', such powerful weapon'' and he also talks about people dying, and the earth destroyed referencing the events i said. \n\nAnd yes, this means that characters from Shingeki no Bahamut also exist in Gran blue fantasy, Jeanne for example exists in both timelines."

Take in count tho that GranBlue fantasy is much, much more like a 90s JRPG fantasy, since it haves people like Hideo Minaba or Nobue Uematsu in it, basically people that worked in the old school Final fantasies (4 and 6), so the story is a little more ''brighter'' and more typical fantasy journey than RoB, so keep that in mind. Still i enjoy the shared universe tho.\n\nMore fun facts: In Granblue Fantasy since the world was destroyed Lucifer decided to not betray the heaven and stills a good guy in this story and he is pretty badass in the game, look at this \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAZi93Zujzkanimation he is a summon just like bahamut\n\nAlso, Cygames has another game called Shadowverse, is a recent card game, and Bahamut is also part of that world, well he kind of got teleported there along with Satan but still, is cool that Cygame basically connected the 3 of their games canonically"

   "text": "the second episode is out since january, theres more action. About the animation, you're right, actually what happened is this, A1 pictures tried to replicate the style of the illustrations of the game, but they understimated the complications of this, A1 pictures had said that due to the style of drawing this show is hard as fuck to animate and make it look fluid, the static shots look really beatiful but is because that, is like trying to animate an illustration, so it gets blurry in fast movements, A1 also said that they had sink a lot of money on this to make it work, as a fun fact, this show has been so hard to animate that was delayed like 3 months"
