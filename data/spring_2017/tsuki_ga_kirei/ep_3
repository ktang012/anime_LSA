He had already once literally gotten in the guys face and breaking the secret that they were dating directly told the guy before pulling her off.

This is under the assumption that she doesn't know that Hira has a crush on her prior to his confession. Although her friends may have been saying in the past that she should get together with Hira, I think the fact that she never considered him in a romantic manner and solely as a friend, she just ended up brushing it off as a joke, and the thought never even crossed her mind that Hira liked her. At the festival, she lost the trash game and had to go with Hira to throw it out (no helping that), and he happens to ask if she wants to get imokoi. In a perfect world being the perfect girlfriend she would've gone back immediately to wait for Azumi, but I believe Azumi sent a text saying \"I'll contact you when I'm nearby\", yet I don't remember her receiving any text from him saying he was nearby after that. It would've been a different story if Azumi had sent the text saying he was almost there and she continued to hang out with Hira, but since she was still waiting on the text from Azumi and she was craving imokoi she thought it was harmless to get in line and buy one since Azumi wasn't there yet/she probably assumed she had some time still. As viewers seeing the big picture we know that wasn't the case because Azumi saw Hira and Akane together which is what caused this conflict, but seriously can you blame Akane for her decision making in that situation? She didn't have any bad intentions whatsoever. The fact that Akane also apologizes to Azumi when she confronts him also indicates the fact that Akane empathizes with what Azumi was going through and feeling, even though at the time of the festival her decisions may have been harmless in her mind, she still realizes and acknowledges that she hurt Azumi.\n \nAnd I'm not trying to say that Azumi is completely in the wrong though, I think he has every right to be upset and feel emotions of jealousy seeing your gf with another guy who you know likes her, but especially after she explained the situation to him I think Azumi could have handled it better. It is realistic for someone his age and in his first experience of love to act the way he did and that's part of what makes this show and its characters so great, but I hope he learned from this experience that communicating his feelings/thoughts to his partner is seriously key in resolving issues like these instead of ignoring them"

In fact it seriously reminded me of myself in high school in my first relationship, and it totally fits the setting of the story as this is both Azumi and Akane first experience with love and dealing with emotions such as jealousy. The way Azumi acted is completely realistic for his age which is something I love about this show, it's just that I hope he learned from this experience to better control his emotions, or if he can't do that then at least to communicate his feelings better and talk it out with his partner rather than leave them in the dark and start ignoring them. Everyone is going to feel jealousy and even I still have trouble dealing with it sometimes, but it definitely helps to communicate with your partner especially during misunderstandings like these rather than to stop talking to them"

Akane would have been upset if Chinatsu actually confessed, and I think she understands that as well. It's nobody's fault that your boyfriend/girlfriend gets courted/confessed to, but even then that doesn't mean the emotional stress that comes afterward to both person doesn't deserve to be dealt with more delicately.

But frankly, being a guy myself, throughout this entire conflict I was absolutely *fuming* at how Azumi was behaving. Not only that, but most of all the fact that he didn't apologize for it and even avoided her during the day altogether. So when Akane finally jumped in, glad as I was that she decided to do so for the sake of both of them, *none of this was her fault!* When she broke down crying, he couldn't even hug her, and when he threw in that quick apology he didn't even get emotional... Idk, the whole thing just rubbed me the wrong way. Azumi was a dick and didn't take the initiative to apologize for it. He should have been the one to break down crying. Akane was genuinely hurt by it, and I just felt so bad for her in having to shoulder that.\n\nI had to remind myself that they're just middle school kids, and given the context the fact that it occurred this way only lends more praise to how well this show is written to fit their age, but I'm still a bit selfish in considering Azumi to be mature enough to realize that he should have apologized sooner and in a more sincere way."

Studios are going to have to come up with some good storylines to match what this anime has been delivering on. Too satisfying of a romance anime as it is, so maybe someone can make one that involves college students or post-grad young adults?

Definitely feel like Azumi shoulders almost all the blame on this and I would've been fine with an end where he apologizes and makes up with her. I usually end up re-watching these episodes soon after, and the scenes of his jealousy are ones I want to skip over because I feel like he acts like a jerk at the festival (EDIT: Nevermind, definitely acts like a prick -.-)\n\n> In the end though everything gets resolved when Akane realizes and aggressively chases after Azumi\n\nBut this is where I can get more behind on how things went down. With the past episodes, I think Akane has gotten a little flak for being more passive in the relationship, letting Azumi jump a lot of the hurdles in their relationship for her. However, I love that Akane sees this misunderstanding put a potential crack in their relationship, realizes how much Azumi wants to be her, and aggressively chases after him and lets her feelings be known.\n\nStill a little peeved that Azumi didn't do more to re-assure her or apologize more about his jealousy, but that ending is still too sweet and an amazing wrap-up to get hung up on the previous conflict of the episode.

Their only interaction was like exchanging glances and that one family interaction once. I can kinda understand how questionable that is but the fact that Akane enjoys being with Azumi and chatting with him, going to places with him, telling each other's frustration in life, etc. is more than enough to say that they belong together.

It is a middle school relationship, nonetheless his first relationship, it's only natural he'd get upset if he saw his girlfriend with another guy, that he knew liked her, alone.

Kotarou has shown us before that he will move in and stop someoone from stealing his girl, but what's going through his head in this scene is that if he's not there to share food and experiences with her, someone else will be. \"Another guy\". He orders the same thing she had, but they didn't get to eat together and this is pretty much what it's like when you love someone and can't be with them.\n\nIt's actually a pretty mature response he takes to the situation, as he's struggling against his own belief that even though they would be far away it would \"turn out fine\" and against his other wants and needs he's really faced this episode with the consequences of the choices he's about to make.\n\nOf course, he couldn't talk to Akane in the meantime because he still hadn't decided and he still hadn't acted through applying for her new school. I think this is totally fair and not a case of bad communication for bad communication's sake. You can't really get angry at Kota for not being able to communicate before he's made up his mind or come to terms with his own situation.\n\nI love the scene on the bridge and I love that 'I'm going to your cram school to study to go to the other school' is brought up earlier in the episode to foreshadow the little circumstance of Akane finding out that Kota decided to follow her before he got to tell her,  and her chasing him down to talk and to get a kiss instead of maybe just waiting to text him later or texting him right then - that was music to my heart."

I had a relationship that started my last year of high school that ended when my girlfriend went to college in another state. We tried to keep it going for a year or so, but it didn't work out. Now she's married to someone she met there, at that school.\n\nThat's one of the best things about this show for me, even as an older adult viewer (I'm in my 30s now :P).

But this time even though I understand Koutaro had his first jelousy encounter but it's hard for me to side with him. I seriously was just staring at my monitor with my heart broken, arms wide open and questioning myself **why?** as poor Akane was tearing up on her potato squishie.\n\nThank god this show patches up mistakes in such a swift and painless way. Kou-chan going to the same school as Akane clears up my doubt I had since episode 1 about them only having one year to make this relationship work. Man, that kiss at the end, it's hands down the most gorgeous kiss of the season.\n\nThere's still no total number of episodes for this series. It can either end up with 12 episodes and give us the idea that they work things out on themselves during highschool. Or give us the whole enchilada and show their actual life in highschool and probably even further in a 2 cour route."

Meanwhile, Akane passes the high school entrance exam she took by endorsement.\")\n\nThe name of the title the episode is Gakumon no Susume, it's a book with a funny translated title: https://www.amazon.com/Soot-because-academic-Kodansha-library/dp/4061597590"

From episode 1 you can tell that she showed a hint of a love interest in Azumi. Crying how they had their first misunderstanding shows how much she only felt something for Azumi and it shows at the end of the episode"

That moment that she saw Azumi and Azumi saw Akane, you could tell that they were both interested with one another. That's how romance goes at certain times."

The usual jealousy or whatever on the guy side resulting in complete silence between the two. I was preparing myself, \"oh, boy, this is all too familiar in romance drama.

At first I felt like it was really being forced and was worried the show would take a steep nosedive after being incredible all season. Thinking about it though, Azumi had quite a lot to think about with his performance, getting ready to talk to his parents, studying, that it's not unreasonable for him to get that way after seeing her with another guy. Especially a guy that's as popular as Hira. It was probably hard for Azumi to verbalize that when Akane was asking what's wrong, because it's possible didn't want to dump his problems on Akane, and he probably realized at some point his jealousy was unwarranted, but still couldn't help but feel that way.\n\nThank God for Akane doing the right thing and pursuing him!

Who would've thought that a high school romance would be my favorite anime of the year so far?\nIt was this episode where the physical barrier between Azumi and Akane breaks.  They've finally realized how important they are to each other, and that they're willing to do whatever it takes to be with one another.  I think that's what I love the most about this series; its sense of progression.  Every interaction Azumi and Akane have is important, because we get to see their development as a couple through these small moments.  It's through these small moments that get them closer to understanding each other, and what it truly means to love someone.  Watching these two slowly form a genuine connection is just satisfying.  It's gonna be hard picking my AotS this Spring, because this show is just fantastic.\n\n[That kiss though!!!](http://i.imgur.com/5VOoE9H.png)"

They talk it out  make up and kiss and he specifically tells her what he wants to do and that he wants be with her! This is a anime right? Where's the self torture , the angst, the long dragged out misunderstandings?? This is actually a anime that the couple handles things reasonable and works them out  and actually communicates ...

Just by telling someone that you love him/her even though you know you have no chance of getting him/her you're getting a huge burden off your chest that otherwise will eat you for years. The one getting confessed can feel proud of being noticed by someone else and can also reject the confession in a polite way, just like Akane did.\n\nI liked Hira's confession, it was very pure and honest, he loved Akane since he saw her for the first time.

That's what they want to get off of their chest.\n\nThis isn't new at all, romance anime has this kind of trope quite often. I'm thinking on top of my head an example like [Hibike Euphonium](/s \"Hazuki thinks there's a thing between Noguchi & Kumiko, yet she asks permission to Kumiko to confess to him. There's no mobs with pitchforks and torches in the audience because everybody wants or thinks Kumiko will end up with Reina, but it's basically the same situation, Hazuki wants to try her luck with Noguchi\")\n\nYou can disagree with this japanese custom, but it's part of their culture."

Unfortunately he's like 15 and needed some time to work through that feeling. I can't entirely blame him (something similar happened to me at 18, as I explain in another post), but he is a jerk to her when he doesn't need to be, even if he is feeling kind of awful about seeing that situation."

Hira didn't give up just because of his confrontation with Koutaro, and that speaks up of his tenacious personality wich keeps him in character. I rather have a well written character that gets a lot of hate by tons of people, than having a character with a doubtful personality out of plot contrivances. Him meddling between Koutaro & Akane brought them a bitter experience, but you have to look for the silverlining in this.\n\nAkane & Koutaro's relationship won't fall apart so easily in the future, this only strengthened their bond. Plus we get to see Akane finally being proactive in this relationship, running towards Koutaro when she finds out he's doing the exams for her highschool in Chiba, and she's the one that breaks the silence after their small breakup.\n\nAlso, that will give Akane a fond memory when she becomes a full adult of being loved by someone else besides Koutaro (I'm pretty sure she will remember that more fondly than the short breakup). Women of all ages crave for that kind of attention even though they have a significant other. Sakura's fantasies from the shorts is the best example at hand of what I'm saying."

Here's this boy she loves very much seemingly mad at her for the first time, and she has absolutely no idea how to make things better. It reminds me of how I unintentionally made my ex-girlfriend cry, and I still feel really bad about it.\n\nAnd then I could feel Akane's extreme relief and happiness at the bridge when Azumi told her his plans. Akane's voice actress did an amazing job. You could feel it in her voice when she simply said \"un\".\n\nIt is a pretty damn shame that this show isn't more popular in Japan.

Azumi announcing that he was essentially willing to go against his parents' wishes to be with Akane and also saying that he sees Akane in his future was a line that I think we've all wanted to see him say since Akane found out she was moving.\n\nA good episode and for once I liked the agonizing part of the episode.

Here's this boy she loves very much seemingly mad at her for the first time, and she has absolutely no idea how to make things better. It reminds me of how I unintentionally made my ex-girlfriend cry, and I still feel really bad about it.\n\nAnd then I could feel Akane's extreme relief and happiness at the bridge when Azumi told her his plans. Akane's voice actress did an amazing job. You could feel it in her voice when she simply said \"un\".\n\nIt is a pretty damn shame that this show isn't more popular in Japan.

   "text": "After spending hours reading post after post after post as to whether Akane did anything wrong or not, I've decided to stick my foot in the fire, too...\n\nIt's not a matter of right or wrong, or of \"cheating,\" or whether or not Akane was constant in her feelings towards Kotarou, it's a matter of whether or not Akane made smart or stupid choices.\n\nSince she knew Kotarou was coming to meet her, and didn't know how long it would take him, she should have immediately gone back to the place she told him she was after throwing out the trash (which she should have done in any case, instead of hanging out alone with another guy, any guy, when she knew her boyfriend is coming to meet her).\n\nInstead of going to get imokoi with Hira, she should have waited and gone to get it with her boyfriend. Why not share that fun time eating something you love with your boyfriend instead of having to later decline when he asks if you want some because you already ate some when you were supposed to be waiting for him?\n\nAnd, most importantly, instead of only telling Kotarou the minimal truth when he asked her if she was with Hira, \"We lost a game and had to throw out the trash\" (which, in reality, probably took all of a minute or two), she should have immediately told him the whole truth instead of hiding the fact that they spent  almost half an hour alone together and that Hira confessed: \"\"We lost a game and had to throw out the trash, then we decided to get imokoi, and we hung out together alone for about a half hour without any of the other track members, and then Hira confessed to me, but I rejected him.\"\n\nAkane has a bad case of double-standards (though she probably doesn't realize it). What is okay for the goose, is not okay for the gander. It is not okay for her boyfriend to have brief encounters alone with other girls (Chinatsu and Kotarou were alone for only a couple minutes at the amusement park, at which Akane got pissed at Kotarou who was completely blameless, instead of being upset with her so-called best friend who was actively trying to break up their relationship), but it's perfectly fine for her to spend time alone with other guys (and especially a guy who she knows is interested in her romantically), wandering leisurely and aimlessly around the amusement park or watching the festival parade meander past instead of spending that precious time with her boyfriend.\n\nFurthermore, since Kotarou knew Akane was not being entirely truthful with him, he might also have thought that Akane's saying that, \"I'm with the track club people\" could also have been a lie, and that she had been alone with Hira the whole evening. After all, there were no other track team members around when he saw Akane and Hira together and he had not seen her with them earlier and, as far as we know, she did not tell him beforehand that she was going to the festival with the track club. Since he knew she was not telling him the whole truth when he asked about Hira, this would certainly make him suspicious and fuel his jealousy. \n\nSo, it's not a matter of whether or not Akane did anything wrong, it's that she made some very stupid choices, choices had she thought about them and how they would affect her relationship with boyfriend, instead of acting on impulse, she might have avoided the subsequent conflict.\n\nIt's not simply a matter of having the right to do this or that, as she would if she did not have a boyfriend, but she is now in a relationship, and if she wants that relationship to last, she has to learn that neither she nor her boyfriend can just do as they please without taking their partner's feelings into consideration."

Some of the complaints earlier on in the series were complaints that Akane was a very jealous person. And if you count the beginning of their relationship as when the entire school found out, then sure. But it obviously was going on from before, and Akane acted pretty jealous. She's also been reassured countless times by Kotarou's actions like at the theme park, he hasn't has that as much, since before this episode, most of the big leaps in their relationship were done by Kotarou."
