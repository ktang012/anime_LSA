   "text": "The \"Harem\" descriptor has lost some of its usefulness, because it now describes two widely different styles of shows.\n\nOn the one hand, you have the \"disgusting\" ones you're probably thinking of, like High School DxD, Trinity Seven, Shinmai Maou no Testament or Masou Gakuen HxH. These are the ones that are all about \"Rub my tits so I get more power\".\n\nThat is, however, a very different thing from something like \"The World God Only Knows\", or even something with Ecchi components like To Love Ru, Saekano, or Infinite Stratos, in which the \"harem\" consists of a bunch of heroines competing for the protagonist's individual attention.\n\nThe former- I can see how it would annoy you. A bunch of female characters engaging in intimacy with the guy solely for some manner of gain at the same time. \n\nThe latter? Eh... think of the most popular guy in your high school- how many girls were in his social group. How many of them would happily have dated him, individually on a one to one basis, if they thought they had a chance and he was unattached? You can argue that the protagonist isn't special enough or interesting enough to BE that popular, but that's a very different thing than it being a \"disgusting notion\".\n\nAnd the thing about the latter is that it offers the possibility of various \"romantic endings\", since rarely do they settle upon a single heroine as being the canon choice. You want the protagonist to end up with Charl in Infinite Stratos? Use your imagination, you don't have to get rid of something the author wrote. Rather than demeaning all of the non-chosen characters as not being good enough for the protagonist's affection, it leaves open that all the various types of girls have value and are real romantic prospects, regardless of their looks or personality. If anything it's the opposite of disgusting."

In that case it would be something along the lines of the show being good in spite of the terrible Harem tag on its genre listing."

Personally, I think having a variety of interesting characters is a good thing in itself, and sometimes a show can be good solely on that level, like they are in CGDCT shows, and that a single male character doesn't ruin that.\n\nI think you might be surprised if you gave up your \"in spite of\" perspective and just looked at the shows as themselves. There's relatively few that I've seen (and as the example of your \"pathetic person\", I've seen a fair few) that don't have some sort of interesting gimmick that affects the ways in which the characters interact between one another. \n\nRosario to Vampire is a pretty good example of this. Moka is a vampire, and drinks blood, preferring the pure-human kind. On the other hand, there's a bunch of other students there that either like human blood just as much, admire the beautiful vampire, or just hate humans generally for forcing them into the shadows. So they tend to attack Tsukune's group, and Moka, having had her true power sealed so as to avoid destroying the school accidentally, needs to be released, but Tsukune is the only one who is able to open the lock restraining her powers. Plus, as time goes on, the repeated feeding on Tsukune, the constant beatings Tsukune suffers as a result of being at the school, and the general exposure to weirdness begins to mutate him into something not-quite-human.\n\nThis is a show from 2008 that nobody would consider being an exception to an \"All battle harems are bad\" rule. Despite that, it has interesting balances of power between the characters that change over the course of the show, interesting worldbuilding, some fun fights, and a look at how unusual circumstances within that world can change someone unexpectedly. \n\nInteresting ideas and consequences that allow your imagination to fly beyond the heights that the show reached, because it introduces the elements for consideration. \n\nIs there an occasional show, like Hundred, that offers absolutely nothing new and has no real reason for being? Sure, but it's cognitive dissonance that causes you to remember Hundred and forget another 10 interesting (at least potentially interesting) shows that you might claim \"break the mold\"."

Even with the animation quality going down i will keep my eyes on this since it could help th 3rd wave feminism to realice how the real world is and that its dangerous not just for them but also for everyone. Also the MC is a bit out for me but its more personal tan a bad thing from the anime.  I read from some heare that the manga is bettter (Como siempre) but i give 1 more EP until move to it, Also you know, i was founding purple in my head but i have daltonism, fk imagination screw the panties."

   "text": "I honestly don\u2019t understand why so many people still watch this show. It has very poor directing and source material seems like nonsense. I have no issue with fantastical and even dumb shows, but character emotions have to be at least consistent. For example we are constantly talking about killing MC even though it doesn\u2019t make any sense in this world, they can\u2019t kill him\u2026 they don\u2019t have that power, but still we are expected to believe that MC is in a serious fight with combatant that are taught to fight. I understand why French girl would be pissed because her underling was defeated as it reflects poorly on her status in school\u2026 this would be actually quite interesting angle that each girl from the five swords is fighting more to gain status at school or to defend their honor, but\u2026 She suddenly treats this as a personal revenge? We were shown throughout whole episode that she treats her lil sis with hands off approach and isn\u2019t overly attached to her.  Personal revenge angle came out of nowhere. You have to set those things up, by showing how she spoils her sister or something.\n\nThose are just two examples, but overall shows feel like really bad version of tropes already done to death.\n"

I didn't find the first episode to be *completely* terrible (mostly because I like sword-wielding girls in general), and I liked the OP, but this episode just had me groaning throughout. Especially during the scene where the MC visited Rin in her room I was afraid my eyes would fall out of their sockets from all the rolling. And *of course* they just had to include a panty shot. Yeah, I'm out."

I would have enjoyed it more if the show had just been about the five main girls kicking ass, or maybe if they had made that emperess chick the MC instead, but as it is I have zero further interest in this series. I don't particularly care for the kind of forced sexual tension shown in this episode (and at the end of the previous one)."
