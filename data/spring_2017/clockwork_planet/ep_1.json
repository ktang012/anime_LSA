But it would stay in the close vicinity of the remains of Earth, after all they are still bound by gravity."

I think the only reason I was able to finish it is that it was so dull. I really disliked Mahouka because of The Cult of Onii-sama, dropping it halfway through the first cour. However, I can at least say that it was technically well executed in many aspects, even if the absurd power of the MC and everyone fawning over him grated on me until it was too much for me to bear. If I didn't have that particular pet peeve, I'm sure I could enjoy it. This show, on the other hand, was hot garbage in almost every way (except perhaps the music, which was passable).\n\nI understand that some shows can be fun even if they're not particularly brilliant, and a lot of folks have made that argument in the discussion threads.

Hell, I like how he just decided to stick with them just for the fun of it"
