Going to an alternate world like 4's TV world and 5's Palaces makes that easier. \n\nIn 3 they usually used Personas during the Dark Hour and inside of Tartarus which also fulfills that description. In 1 and 2 demons were running around in the real world so that definitely counts. \n\nIn 3 they also shot themselves with guns to bring out their personas. That allows them to bring them out in the real world when necessary and it happens in a couple of important story beats. Also a couple of the cast of 3 are shown to just be better at using their personas and having more power than the cast of 4, so it might just be because of talent. But yeah, 3 has personas explicitly used outside in the real world, P4 Arena has a couple instances and 1 and 2 has them constantly.  "

We really didn't need to introduce the assassin high school girl  character, and we DEFINITELY didn't need to waste nearly half the episode listening to her butcher basic philosophy.  Instead, what should have happened was the episode should have been a flashback SHOWING us the MC's interactions with setsuna as they created the antagonist character, and the circumstances centered around that. . .you know \"Show don't tell\" and all.  But nope, they had to pretty much make the MC drop 50 IQ points and waste an episode on a stupid character introduction,  B.S. philosophy that you hear in every show pretty much, and deal with an underdeveloped side character serving as a catalyst for \"action\" when she should have reconciled her issues 3 episodes ago by her \"creator\" giving her all of her books to read so that she can realize that \"hey, everything works out in the end, maybe we should stop and think before tearing shit up all the time.\"\n\nThe MC and the stupid lance chick make my head heard from Writer-induced-stupidity"

Either she envies Mamika's innocence, or she's really blind (her conversation with Assassin-chan makes me believe the latter)."

But, because he sees his and his family suffering in MUP situation, he decides to not let other people from interfering, which he explicitly stated in last episode.\n\n\nAnd yeah, Aliceteria is a realist. It's a bit irritating when no one even tries to tell her things which will change her mind. But plot demands I guess. Meteora for sure, as a character, was shown capable of making such decisions. But in this case she didn't."

We can only make assumptions like the fact it has to be accepted by a large amount of people for it to be \"canon\", this means interrupting the anime broadcast (the timeline Selesia came from) and inserting that new Vogelchevalier ability, and _hopefully_ the fans accept it. So even if they want to allow Selesia her full potential while disregarding the strains on reality (usual conundrum, strain reality now to defeat bad guys trying to actually rip reality, or not strain reality and have an incredibly low odds of stopping bad guys actually ripping reality) it probably won't be very easy to do at all.

The only things you should completely trust for name spelling would be names spelled in English in the show (not in the subtitles, like Alicetaria) or the Japanese names (like Kirameki Mamika and Chikujouin Magane.)\n\nFor Blitz, the closest thing to \"official\" spelling in English would be the amazon subs that have his name as \"Blitz Talker.\"  \"\u30c8\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\" (tookaa, Blitz's last name) is how you would sound/write out \"Talker\" in japanese though, so I'd wager Talker is the right choice."

Alice hardens her resolve and slowly moves to the side, leaving Mamika uncertain in her original position as Alice and Makagami ramp up to a fight.  Then, once Meteora and Celestia arrive, Makagami once again moves away to establish her own position, and we end up with only Meteora and Celestia being joined in purpose- everyone else is independent, whether they are uncertain or simply differently resolved."

While that phrase had appeared in other series and songs before, it was apparantly from a 1915 Japanese song, \"Gondola no Uta\", that starts all 4 verses with that line. \n\nThe song itself, from I could tell from the translated lyrics, is basically urging one to seize the day and find love, since what's gone may never return. While there isn't much romance in this episode, the decisions made by Mamika at the end fit this title to some extent since she had to do what she considers to be right lest everything becomes irreversible. \n\nOn a side note, traditional Mahou Shoujos are truly the most overpowered chraracters every created.

   "text": "I like Makagami already. It's fortunate the government met the protagonists *before* their impressions were coloured by a sadistic and petty murder. I can't tell if her curse is still active (meaning the battle will end with Alicetelia getting stabbed by her own spear) or if Celestia interrupted it. The [anime promo image](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34561/Re_Creators) suggests she'll end up on Gunpuku's side and Yuuya will get dragged onto Meteora's, though they could both still end up independent. Considering the clash of beliefs among Gunpuku's allies already, it would be fun to see Makagami joining them.\n\nWatching Makagami back away from the impending battle and then watching from afar was pretty amusing, too. She may not have powers good for direct combat, especially once the talking stops. It seems to be a speech-based trap-setting magic, which would be extremely powerful if she could set it up, but if she has nothing else then she's vulnerable to anyone who decided she's kill-on-sight before she can do that.\n\nIt's about time we got some action back. A fight being between Alicetelia and Celestia is possibly the least interesting combination when most others have powers that aren't primarily \"hit someone with a melee weapon while flying\", but they're flashy enough for an action scene, and we at least have another battle going on at the same time.\n\nI would've liked to see Mamika have more of a reaction to Alicetelia so carelessly damaging the city around her, but her initial ineffectual protests and reluctance to use force are otherwise what I'd expect. She definitely shouldn't have the reaction time or projectile speed to block bullets *after they're fired* with individual projectiles of her own, but on the other hand I do like seeing bullets getting blocked by floating pink hearts. I'll let it pass.\n\nI don't in principle disagree with the government saying \"hey, don't use machine guns or explosives in the city without clearance\" - although those weapons don't seem that powerful compared to the offenses everyone else has - but not leaving her with *any* weapons? To maintain trust, it's reasonable to want to keep her promises, but you'd think they'd have thought about unexpected battles or something. Granted, it wouldn't be a problem if Meteora planned ahead a little (\"I see Gunpuku's allies and the murderer, we're in an area without people, there's a chance this will turn into a fight\") but it makes sense for her to not have thought of it yet, as a noncombatant. Since she and Kikuchihara are both supposed to be smart, though, I expect them to think of a way to make sure this doesn't happen again next time."

At times, I still lose interest, but the small moments where characters grow from being archetypes are points that keep my interest. The same as with most anime where characters fill a role. \n\nTake Busou Shoujo Machiavellianism for instance, the characters are archetypes and while it is somewhat stale the show doesn't try to parade them as anything but archetypes. That being said, it is interesting because the main character fills an archetype that is more rarely done when not in a comedy like Konosuba. The show doesn't try to be completely serious either, it knows its shit and runs with that as well as it can. It is a a smug mc who despite being looked at as a school idol is doing what anyone would do. Think before you act and don't piss off anyone particularly skilled/capable.

Only her expectations about magical girl life were idealistic, reality was messed up from the beginning. Mamika however hails from the simple, colorful world of your standard mahou shoujo anime aimed for younger audience. It wasn't just her delusions, it was the world she lived and worked for god know how long. In her case it's about learning new rules and trying to maintain her view of the world that worked in her simpler version of reality."

   "text": "My opinion seems to be somewhat dissenting of the general consensus regarding this episode, so I hope you'll be understanding.\n\nI really do love this show, but I have to say, it's a somewhat worrying trend, seeing this show repeatedly opt to rely on lengthy talking scenes as centerpieces.\n\nAlmost all of them so far could have been conveyed more succinctly while retaining the same emotional or cerebral impact.\n\nAnd moreover, it increasingly seems to defer to one of only two modes - talk or battle. While the beginning of the ep showed promise in terms of plot, the rest felt very stagnant. Nothing came out of Souta's revelation because it's convenient to have him keep a lid on it for now; and there wasn't an interesting way in which the two factions got to Makagami. No tension of seeking her out or who will get to her first. They just promptly find her, then talk then battle. And even then, the battle comes after another overlong example of the need to spell out and reiterate the characters' reasoning.\n\nI think I'd even be okay with lengthy talk scenes if they felt more dynamic. Too many of them are either expositions, or monologues spouting the character's philosophy. A dialogue scene can provide an excellent stage for a battle of wits, but I feel that opportunity wasn't quite seized here.\n\nI did think the battle was pretty cool, even though the bridge duel sakuga felt a little off. I also think the voice-based leitmotif Sawano uses for the action sequences is a little too intrusive, while a more instrumental score would better serve the action.\n\nI loved seeing Celestia discover the joy of handheld technology, and dropping in with a knock on the window. Those simple, cozy moments at home never fail to warm my heart.\n\nWhile it seems I'm very critical, it's primarily because I really fell in love with this show in the first few episodes, and hold it to a really high standard. And still climb the walls going nuts waiting a whole freakin' week anxious for another episode.\n\nWow, this came out long. If you read this whole silly rant, thank you and sorry. :)\n\nEDIT: Also, it was nice to witness Mamika's mini-arc. :)"

Meteora being the wise wizard showed just how wrong Aliceteria is, but who could blame her? She just wants the best for her world so she can't accept that everything she is doing is in vain.\n\nCrazy girl really showed up this episode, that's a nifty power, one that fits her, and everything about her is relatable to her character and doesn't fit at all with the real world, *perfect*. The poor shopkeeper... That scene was too savage, I wonder what her manga/LN is about, and what other powers are in there.\n\nI don't know what to think about Sota hiding what he knows...

This puts her at complete odds with Meteora's \"I'll beat them with reason and logic\" strategy. Selesia knows she's supposed to be on the side of not causing trouble, but she likes a good throw-down far too much. Even Mamika gets into the fight because her moral compass is far too strong to permit her to do anything else.\n\nSadly, the most reasonable one there was the flying gunman; who understands that it's all stupid, his pointy-haired boss is an idiot, but he's not about to bite the hand that signs his paychecks; so he's going to do his job and try not to make more of a mess than necessary doing it."

Berlichingen was a German Imperial Knight who lost his right arm during the battle, yet he made himself an iron prosthetic one and continued his military service. He was then called \"G\u00f6tz the Iron hand\", and if you look at Alice's character design, you will find it an obvious reference to G\u00f6tz.\nAlso, what she said during the second part of her chanting is \"Donnerschlag des J\u00e4gers\", which means \"Thunderclap of the hunter\""

The part of the cap 2 when Mamika is surprised to see blood is fantastic, reflecting the distance of the worlds (most common worlds) of the mahou shoujos, world that are not usually \"dangerous\".\nlate comment but, but I really enjoys the scenes of Mamika and the interaction with the other characters and his concepts.\n"
