To each their own.\n\n---\n\nI'm putting more thoughts in this than such a minor detail deserves, that's for sure. But something being a common trope doesn't mean that it doesn't impact the story. Someone sat and wondered if they should include a running joke with Albus calling Mercenary Ojisan, and Mercenary disliking it. I'm pretty sure that that person has their reasons to make the decision to include it, because it shapes the story."

EDIT: Quality seems to be fine now.\n- Their initial release for Shingeki no Bahamut came without subtitles (fucking kek)\n\nWhich means that even though they hold the license of 2 shows I'm watching, I'm still forced to pirate both of them if I want to see the episodes within a reasonable timeframe and quality.\n\nIn other words, don't give them clicks, pirate until they get their shit together and subscribe to platforms that actually care about your experience.\n\nEDIT: Just watched parts of Re:Creators ep.2 and the German subs are horrible at times.

   "text": "I am not wrong. You are not seeing the bigger picture. That angry medieval mob of 20-30 people was probably a majority of the village because of scarce population back in the day. When was the last time you saw over half of the city mobilizing to hunt or torch someone down and not giving him/her a chance to explain themselves? These days even the biggest scums get lawyers and it turns out that lots of those people were innocent. Of course it goes both ways, lots of people who are guilty go free. \n\nBut still in majority of those cases you have your basic human rights. Rights that are mostly protected. You didn't have that back in the day. If someone was jealous of your stuff he'd simply call you a thief or a with and you'd get torched no matter what.\n\nI'm not saying that verbal abuse is right. I'm not saying that those cases are entirely gone. But you don't get killed as often because you've insulted somebody. A couple centuries ago if you'd insult a noble you'd get killed or beaten. Now you can go strike and call your president a dick. \n\nThere will always be aggressors and there will always be crimes no matter what era we live in. But statistically we are doing better. If in a modern crime a kid shots 10 people the whole world knows about it but it is still a fraction of the city's population. Back then If a mob killed 10 people in a feud that could easily be 10% of the village's population. \n\nMost people nowadays lead a normal lives and don't get involved in crimes. Mostly because of the law and legal authorities. But also because they've been risen in a good environment and have been educated to *think* before they do something stupid. In mere 15 years of education we get the amount of knowledge that would be worth being a village's elder back in the days. \n\nWe are doing better."

She's a bit of a strange one.\")\n\nBut let us assume he is being tactful, and having a mercenary who is an expert at killing witches in close proximity is a good idea in case of an emergency.\n\nBut then he wouldn't say things like \"We can rebuild our homes, but we can't heal the deep wounds in our hearts.\" If he really was full of hate & prejudice, he would put it differently, with a lot more hatred in his words and expressions (and preferably in a way that relates with the beastfallen as it is common knowledge that they despise witches).\n\nAnd then there's the way blondie walks towards the group - with his right hand raised, putting the ring in everyone's sight, saying \"Um..\" with an expression that indicates that he is going to say something about it.

It doesn't seem to be a very action-focused story and usually conflict is quickly resolved through tact or conversation, which I can really appreciate. It doesn't put in too many or too long action scenes and uses its time better to develop its world more. This is a problem I had with most Fantasy stories that Zero Mahou handles very well. I also like the protagonist for not being a teenage wimpy guy, and the main girl for not being a tsundere. This show is quite nice, and I'm very pleasantly surprised."

Or the other way around, if he feels so proud of the current witch hunt situation he should have felt betrayed by Sorena when he was a kid.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nAlso feels a tad contrived how the mayor offers them a house since they are just passing by. He just ask them to help out when needed in the witch hunt. But they are just passing by, they will probably leave in the morning, there won't be any time for the group to help them out.\n\nNext we get the scene where every villager pulls out their pitchfork because they think the boy stole the ring. And the mayor states that they've had some thefts lately and proceeds to intimidate the boy and interrogate the rest of the group. Seriously, if they had so many problems with thieves lately. Why the heck do they welcome the group so openly and offer them a house as an opening line? why not ask them what's their business first and where are they heading to, and find out their true intentions before offering lodging. That's pretty much the rule every village pulls when strangers arrive. Not to mention the questioning and even checking up their goods to see if they carry stolen merch is enforced more thouroughly in these situations."
