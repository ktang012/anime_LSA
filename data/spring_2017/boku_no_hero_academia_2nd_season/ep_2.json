   "text": "> Todoroki did defeat Deku in the fight but kind of got destroyed mentally by the fight. Poor guy got his world rocked by Deku.\n\nWhile I don't disagree with this point, I want to point out that Todoroki had a different overarching goal for the tournament that he failed to reach that was a bit more significant than \"win the battle, lose the war\".\n\nFor Todoroki, this tournament gave him the chance to prove his powers and escape the shadow of his father by winning without using his fire power. This was why he was upset when he instinctively went for the fire power during the cavalry battle; Todoroki wanted to show he had the power to be the best without his father's influence, both physically and emotionally.\n\nThen, in the battle with Deku, Todoroki was pressed into using the fire half of his power. Sure, it was emotional, and he won that fight, but he still broke the vow he made to win without the power, and to Todoroki, that's just as bad as losing the fight. This disappointment is magnified by the finals, where Todoroki felt he had the chance to renew his oath to win without using his fire power. After all, if he could be beat Bakugo without fire, then it would show he could've won the deku fight as well without it. However, Todoroki lost to Bakugo, basically due to not using his fire side. \n\nEssentially, Todoroki failed to get what he wanted out of the tournament in 2 ways. He couldn't hold himself to the vow of not using his power at all, and used it with both conflicts against Deku. Todoroki also showed he wasn't strong enough to just win by using the ice side, as he lost in the finals to Bakugo. It wasn't just that Todoroki failed to win, its that he failed to win because he didn't use his fire half. His father is a part of him, and the tournament has given Todoroki enough proof that he needs to accept and get over that connection, rather than crippling his power to make a point."

Deku reminded him that the reason why he was in this school - just like everyone else - was to become a hero, and a hero should give their all and try their best to strive for victory. After the match, he was not disappointed that he couldn't withhold his fire power. He *willingly* used his fire against Deku. He was lost about what is his actual goal: being a hero or proving his dad wrong. My understanding points to a completely different set of motivations to the fight this episode than yours. When he used fire against Bakugo, it was not because he lost control temporarily, but because he want to experiment being his full self due to Deku's influence. He later stopped using fire not because he has to uphold his promise to not use fire, but because he is hesitating about which goal he should follow. His fight with Deku was growth rather than defeat. He rediscovered his passion to become a hero, even though he still couldn't let go of his grudge for his dad yet. "

I think this was meant to appeal to the theme from season 1 that a hero is one who *can't help themselves from lending a hand to others* instinctively, without thinking, even if that wasn't what they were planning to do. Deku walked into the match wanting to win - he wanted to win the whole time - but he just can't stop himself from helping Todoroki when Deku saw his hesitation.

   "text": "Yeah, I was just going to say: Todoroki wasn't upset that he lost the tournament, because after his fight with Deku, he no longer saw the sports festival as a significant goal towards becoming a hero. And he lost the will to put everything he had into winning the tournament because his trauma and old conflicted feelings resurfaced. One of the teacher's made this point. Todoroki moves with just his ice attacks were usually better than they were when he fought Bakugo.\n\nHis outlook changed. He realized the trauma he experienced as a child is what is more important to address. But more than that, he realized he needs to make amends. He was so focused on his anger and rage directed at his father, and caught up in his own emotional turmoil that he was neglecting his Mother and their relationship. Perhaps at the back of his mind he would like his entire family to be healed, even his relationship with his father, and his father's with his mother's, as well. But first the change has to start with him. He has to do what he can himself, and getting pig-headed about being good enough to win the tournament with just his ice powers is a false prize.\n\nHe had a pretty simple outlook before: prove his own strength by rejecting his Father's power, but Deku put a large hole in that idea by uknowingly reinforcing his mother's wisdom and kindness that was blocked out by his trauma. It was because of Todoroki's mother's words and Deku's efforts that reminded him of the fact that he is own person: he can't live his life at the expense of someone else, whether it be a grudge, or emotional over-reliance. \n\nThis show is amazing with its portrayal of human behavior and relationships. It feels so much more authentic than most shounen battle shows, which bring the drama but have a lot of convenient plot/character developments as well. Boku No Hero Academia avoids a lot of tropes by just attempting to be more honest with the audience, by producing more honest characters. It isn't actively subverting tropes for the sake of it, but because it just makes more sense and the writing is good enough to pull it off, and I love it for it."

They are both extremely talented, ambitious and combat/strategy genius. Karma however is more respectful and is actually nice. However, I love Bakugo's relentless drive and desire to become a hero. It is a refreshing take on where Karma may have been the norm (as a stereotypical rival) or someone who may seem to be on a path to become a villain/antagonistic force but probably won't. He respects strength, doesn't get cocky and carefully evaluates every opponent. I can't condone his behavior towards Deku but that doesn't really matter as characters have their flaws. \n\nPS: I personally think people are crazy if Deku/Bakugo are eventually going to become grudging friends or something in the future. That path was closed a long time and I don't think either are interested in opening it otherwise. After all, Deku was systematically put down and teased by Bakugo (read: Name), whether it is a twisted sense of protecting Deku (which is a bit generous and possibly BS). A friendship between Nagisa and Karma can happen/exists but not for the other. Deku and Bakugo respect each other and have a competitive drive to beat each other but won't be anything more than mutual acquaintances at best."

The only time they're around each other is to spar/fight/train or if they have to team up to fight someone else. They respect each other and recognize that they need each other to push themselves higher. They build off of each other's flaws and become better by working together. But it's not out of friendship. It's just a healthy rivalry.\n\nRight now Deku and Kacchan have what I would call an unhealthy rivalry, borderline enemies even. Deku respects Kacchan but Kacchan still refuses to respect Deku. Despite this, Kacchan understands Deku's strengths and resolve but just doesn't want to admit them. \n\nI think their relationship is going to be the slowest one to develop, but it *will* develop. Eventually they will be the 2 top heroes and it will only be because they finally accepted each other as their true rival. They probably won't ever be on friendly terms with each other, but they will respect each other and, when the stakes get real, they'll have each other's backs. \n\nNote: This is all speculation. It could end up completely different from this. But this is just my personal interpretation of their characters and where I would personally like to see them end up.\n\nBtw, love the Assassination Classroom reference. I just watched that a few weeks ago and I really enjoyed it."

We couldn't wait to see you react to how close your predictions were. This was the moment I was waiting for because I wanted to see your reaction to how Horikoshi managed to give Bakugo the victory and still use it to develop his character. \n\nThis fight did so much for not only Bakugo, but for Todoroki and Midoriya as well. It was realistic in the sense that Todoroki managed to temporarily overcome his emotional trauma while fighting Midoriya due to being caught up in the adrenaline of their fight, but once he had time to dwell on it he only became more uncertain of himself. Once again Horikoshi manages to beautifully subvert a classic shonen trope by showing how years of emotional trauma aren't so easy to just get over after a pep talk. \n\nKeep on watching. This series will continue to surprise you. Keep that in mind when you make predictions for future episodes and don't let yourself fall victim to classic tropes. This series does an excellent job either subverting them or using them in a constructive way that doesn't detract from the writing. If you think something wouldn't make sense for the story (such as how you thought Bakugo winning this tournament wouldn't develop him) then maybe you just have to think about it a different way."

   "text": ">It'd make sense for a finale where Bakugo doesn't win, since in theory winning would just mean Bakugo has no reason to develop any further.\n\nI don't think that's the case at all. Bakugou is the same guy win or lose. I liken him to a pathologically competitive athlete, i.e. Michael Jordan. Losing would just make Bakugou think his explosions weren't good enough, how to explode things better next time, and what to add to his morning explosion routine. He'd spend a few days strategizing out how to best blow up Todoroki for a few days so he could demolish him the next time they fight. That would be the extent of his character development. And winning a close or unsatisfactory fight doesn't really change anything.\n\nOn the other hand, the tournament has revealed things about Bakugou. He respects his opponents (except Deku). He's creative with his quirk and quick to exploit his opponents disadvantages. He's worked hard for his body to be capable of physically handling his quirk and to use it with precision. (Taking his control of his quirk and his personality into consideration, I think it's likely that he's the hardest worker in his class by a decent margin.) He wants to be the very best and to prove it.\n\nFor Bakugou to have meaningful character development, I think his attitude has to have real consequences out on the field. That being said, I don't think he really needs to change *that* much. He has a lot of admirable qualities to go along with his negatives. Heck, Endeavor is the #2 hero and he makes Bakugou look like a saint in comparison. Horikoshi has made a distinction between being a good person and being an effective hero. Baku might never be the former, but he can certainly become the latter."

The foundations are there, and if you look hard enough you can see the subtleties in his character's development. \n\nBut we're still very early into the series. The author has obviously intended for Bakugo to receive the slowest character development of the main cast (let's be real here, it makes perfect sense because there is a **lot** of work involved with developing this character). I'd rather get a realistic rate of development than have it all rushed into the first 2 seasons.\n\nI like to compare Bakugo to Vegeta actually. Vegeta is a character that took almost the entirety of Dragon Ball Z to develop. He was similar to Bakugo with his issues of pride and anger (although not *as* angry). It took him until the very last few episodes to *finally* admit to himself that Goku, this \"low class\" warrior, was actually a stronger warrior worthy of being Vegeta's rival. Sound familiar? Bakugo sees Midoriya just like Vegeta used to see Goku. \n\nBakugo will develop. It's just going to be very, very slow. But the payoff will be much more worth it because of that. His character development will be satisfying because it will be realistic and not rushed."

If he lost, he would accept that he wasn't the best and try harder to win next time. But with the way things turned out, he doesn't feel like he won. He never got to defeat Deku himself, which might not be a big deal since he defeated Todoriki who defeated Deku. But, in essence, he didn't, because the Todoriki that beat Deku was twice as strong as the Todoriki he defeated. \n\nDeku lost, but he lost to the person Bakugou never really got to fight. He feels like he didn't beat Todoriki since he didn't fight his full strength, so (perhaps more importantly) he feels like he didn't beat Deku. \n\nIf he lost to Todoriki at full strength, he would have came in second. But in his mind currently, he came in third. He still doesn't feel proven against either of them and it eats him alive. Instead of losing justly, he feels cheated out of the win he wanted. \n\nA lot of people see him as arrogant and in need of humility, which is what a loss would bring, but I don't sense that from him. If he **knew** he was the best, he wouldn't need to prove it in this tournament. He would just know he's the best and feel it as evident. Think about how Bakugou interacts with the other students, barely even acknowledging them as adversaries, similar to how Todoriki acts with others. Baku doesn't see others as threats, so he doesn't even care about beating them. He won't even remember his classmates names/powers. But he knows Deku and Todoriki are just as good as he is. He doesn't know if he can beat them, so he has to prove it to himself that he can. "

Had Todoroki been able to use his fire side it would be interesting to see if he would have an easier time either deflected or absorbing Bakugo's explosions.\n\n- Bakugo has some serious drive and desire to not just become number one but to prove himself against everyone at their maximum potential, gotta respect that.\n\n- Holy hell the size of Bakugo's explosion.\n\n- Oh my god the entrance of the three victors, Bakugo's flailing had me in tears.\n\n- I'm a little surprise Iida didn't just run home\n\n- All Might getting spoken over and subsequently not chanting plus ultra had me cringing for him, shows even he is human.\n\n- Also love the constructive criticism he gave the viktors and Todoroki's new resolve.\n\n- Bakugo still holding the medal in his mouth in the classroom made me wonder, did he hold it like that all night just to show off that he won or is it his show of protest that he didn't want the award?\n\n- Iida best brother\n\n- Looks like all of the people that Todoroki's father stated 'were in a different world' from him are his siblings, meaning he likely sees them as failures. Good on them for further development on Todoroki having to go meet his problems face to face rather than suddenly being able to use his flames.\n\n- OH MY GOD OCHACO'S FAMILY SCARED ME TO DEATH\n\n- Her eyeball what in the world her and her family are horrifying.\n\n- I feel for Midoriya's mom, having to deal with a children constantly hurting himself and being thrown into the hero world. Midoraya's mom #1 hero.\n\n- Bakugo sure does love shouting that he's going to kill things.\n\n- I wanted to see more stain and a certain something that happened in the manga, but I suppose that will be the next episode. Waiting a week is just so hard >.<\n\nAlso fear not, there should be 12 more episodes in this season but this concludes the tournament arc, however this hero exam is still ongoing."

   "text": "It'll get covered in the next arc in a bit more detail, and then even more detail later on. It's something that has varying degrees of enforcement. If your quirk is something that doesn't really affect other people or isn't very obstructive to the public, then most people just ignore it if you use it. \n\nTake Deku's mom for instance. If she dropped her phone in public and just casually floated it back up to her hand, nobody would yell at her for it. She wouldn't get a ticket or anything. But if someone like Iida was running through town at full speed, then he'd get in trouble for it because he could run into someone or damage property (maybe by cracking the sidewalk from accelerating too quickly on it). \n\nAs for the practical reasons, remember how Bakugo was talking about how quirks have their limits during the Deku vs Todoroki fight? We don't know Iida's limit when it comes to long distances. Maybe he isn't yet able to run that far without having to rest. We do know that he's only able to reach super speeds when he activates his reciproburst, and that only lasts for a few seconds before his engines stall completely and he's essentially left powerless for a time. \n\nI think he's faster than a bullet train when using reciproburst but that's not an option for long distances so the bullet train was the better choice. This is of course ignoring the fact that he isn't even legally allowed to use his quirk in public. So even if Iida was faster than the bullet train, he wouldn't do something illegal anyways."

It's because Todoroki used his flames on Deku. In Bakugo's mind, Todoroki refusing to use his flames against him makes Bakugo think that Todoroki views Deku as a more worthy opponent than Bakugo and that severely pisses him off. If Todoroki had beaten Deku with only his ice, then Bakugo would have only been mildy upset that he didn't use his flames against him. He wouldn't have enjoyed winning knowing his opponent was holding back, but he wouldn't have been so absolutely fucking pissed. That's only because of his complicated feelings toward Deku, feelings he doesn't even understand yet.\n\nBakugo is afraid of Deku. He just doesn't realize it yet. And it's not even Deku's power that he's afraid of, it's his character. Deku is the only one that treated Bakugo like an equal instead of like a superior back when they were kids. Bakugo's personality seems strong, but it's actually quite frail. Deku simply extending his hand toward Bakugo makes Bakugo feel weak and pathetic. He's afraid of Deku because Deku represents that everyone is strong in their own way, which means nobody can be the undisputed strongest person. This shatters Bakugo's ideal of becoming the absolute strongest person and best hero there is because it forces Bakugo to accept his own weaknesses. \n\nBakugo will have to overcome that eventually and he'll have to stop using Deku as his scapegoat for his own personal feelings of inadequacy and weakness. For years Bakugo was able to just ignore the possibility that he could even have weaknesses because he kept himself surrounded by people weaker than him. He was a big fish in a small pond. But the smallest fish of them all, Deku, started growing and made Bakugo realize that if the weak can become strong, then the strong can become weak. And this realization terrifies Bakugo. "

The main fights are very clearly established with Deku vs. Todoroki, Bakugou vs. Uraraka and the final Bakugou vs. Todoroki the only ones being at least one entire chapter long and in which we have the characterization and the nice action scenes (esp. in Deku vs Todoroki). This is like HxH's where it being the starting arc introduces characters but mostly focuses on Gon, Hisoka, and Killua, and it ending somewhat anticlimactically in a way with Killua and Illumi. Kurapika's arc w/ his backstory is more of Yorknew rather than Hunter Exam, unlike Todoroki's who gets his backstory here. I don't see who else the Hunter Exam really focused on although it does have more interesting action."

His anger makes me laugh a lot sometimes. What happened to Iida's older brother was tragic and it was emotional seeing Idia having to deal with it. Yet another enjoyable/emotional/heart-warming episode of Boku no Hero Academia. I had a feeling Bakugo would win the fight because Todoroki was stil unsure whether to use his left side. I can't wait for the next episode/arc! After losing in the TOURNAMENT ARC!!! Midoriya will take this as encouragement to get stronger. He still needs to learn to control his power tho. Pissing off Bakugo would land you in hot water with him and possibly an even worse situation lol."

That takes a certain degree of physical control, but it's practically instinctual considering how much he uses his power.\n\nHis constant bullying of Deku is something hard to look over. The faces he makes are consistently representative of his entirely selfish desires and lack of regard for others. They're twisted and represent his almost obsessive focus on this abstract concept of winning and being the best. It may seem odd that I reference the faces made by Bakugo, but it's quite common in anime that the face a person makes represents what they feel, and the faces he makes at times go beyond the mere \"comical angry face\" and go into \"some sick twisted obsession face\". \n\nI can understand the appeal of Bakugo. I laughed when he was brushing his teeth like everyone else. He has his good moments, but other times I just think to myself (not in a funny way):\n\n\"There's something messed up in his head\"\n "

How often in anime are all the main characters' parents dead?  I can't wait to see the interaction with his mom. In a way, Midoriya vs. Todoroki was the real Final in this tournament - not to take anything away from Bakugo, who is unquestionably a genius."

It's a shame that Bakugou (and us viewers) didn't get the fight he (we) wanted with Todoroki but that's to be expected since the latter has to figure how to solve his inner problems. He's not going to just flip a switch after less than one day for Christ's sake.\n\nI loved how in the end of the festival nobody seemed satisfied of their performance (That's how I think of it anyway). Every wants to work hard at getting better for the future. Bakugou with his pride, Todoroki with his left side, Deku with his OfA power, Tokoyami with his versatility, Uraraka with her combat skills, and so on and so forth. That was so good.\n\nTodoroki's recovery begins with his visit to his mom. It's time to mend his wounds so that he finally properly work towards becoming a hero. Meanwhile, the way Uraraka's parents were scrambling towards her looked funny to me and their red eyes made it that much better. I will always like the interactions between Deku and his mother. And Bakugou.....you really care about your teeth, don't you. The ending in his bathroom was funny, but I prefer [the manga version](http://i.imgur.com/6nqiJJc.jpg) more than the anime.\n\nNext arc here we come!!! Until next week, PLUS ULTRA!!!"

I had to take a break mid episode after watching Bakugo wins, and I was thinking that the direction they took with Shoto's childhood trauma was correct.\n\n You can't heal that just from a pep talk, you need to go to the root of the problem which is his mother, whom (if you didn't pay attention to the episode) he didn't see again after the boiling water incident. So, the fact that he lost because he didn't use his fire (or, really, completely gave up since he cared too much about fixing this whole trauma and making up with his mother) is completely understandable, considering he's now questioning everything he stood for pretty much a decade regarding his personal \"Quirk usage policy\"."
