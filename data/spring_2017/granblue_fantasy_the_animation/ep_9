That level of power those 2 have inside, obviously they can just use like 5% of that power (wich is already a fucking lot). \n\nThe main weakness of Gran is being a ''newbie'' swordsman, sucking at being defensive, he is a glass cannon, and the fact that his powers get weak if he is far away from Lyria, if he gets too far away from her, he just can't use his powers. Lyria is basically his power plant. He has been able to make those fancy manouvers just because his dad taught him some basic shit when we he was younger and because bahamut is a hell of an attack buff.

While his attack may have enough power to break Tiamat's crystal, all those manouvers and jumping he did out of nowhere is just a no no for me.\n\nI agree, while in lore is explained that the small % of power Lyria gave to Gran enhanced his overrall physical capabilities theres no real excuse for the fancy moves. I think the studio just wanted to make it bombastic, the game is turn based so theres no super exciting action, and they just went all-in in the animation.\n\n> In the game, Is Gran the only unit capable of receiving Bahamut's power from Lyria?\n\nYes, she can buff other people of her party with Bahamut's offensive power, she can also heal. Tho in the other hand is important to note that she having the dragon inside her, Bahamut will try to do his best to keep her alive no matter what, technically Gran and Lyria's souls are now just 1 soul that is being shared in 2 bodies so now Gran also haves more resistance.\n\nThats why she chooses Gran to fight Tiamat because he also haves the same resistance as her now.\n\n> I think Katalina, story wise, has the right training to do all the things Gran did.\n\nKatalina knows healing magic and frost magic, and she is overall much more powerful skill wise than Gran atm in the story.\n\nRackam will train him in fire weapons and Katalina in magic later in the story.\n\nA little and funny spoiler... The annoying mini dragon of Gran haven't show his full form yet."

For example that scene of episode 4 were Rackam, Katalina and Gran were fighting together vs the 2 assasins, more thing like that we need. A side from that the shows follows the tropes of early 90s Jrpgs fairly good, it has the old school final fantasy vibe all over it (Actually the game was made by people who worked in Final fantasy 4 and 6 that Cygames hired, thats why it looks like FF so much). It can be either super generic to some people or super nostalgic and old school to others.\n\nAnother thing i like about GranBlue is that is the complete opposite to the narrative of Shingeki no bahamut season 1. Not only the atmosphere is completely opposite but the also the story, in SnB 1 the main characters were trying to prevent Bahamut from being released, in granblue the main characters are the ones who carry bahamut while the ''bad'' guys are the guys trying to prevent bahamut from being released. cool stuff\n\nAnd yes, the little shit can get into full dragon form when annoyed or scared enough.\n\nOh also, Lucifer is a good guy in the world of GBF LUL"

   "text": "Finally saw the episode. I think that the buff for Gran was purple because she used Bahamut's power for him while for the others she used Tiamat's. It is good to know this, but as I see this, it surely puts a problem storytelling wise for me.\n\nI mean, we didn't see Lyria coming into a realization that she can also buff another person besides Gran, this means that she always knew and it was possible for others to receive their buffs. This puts a dent into the fight against Tiamat for me since as I was saying, Katalina was story wise the character suited for doing that crazy jump, not Gran, specially since she already knew that Katalina was able to receive her buff.\n\nNow, this episode does provides a reason that why Lyria didn't pick Katalina to do the jump and face Tiamat, and that is that she sees Katalina like the closest thing she has for a mother, to the point of caring for Katalina a lot. I could buy it if this was the reason, but in no way I can buy those moves Gran pulled off without practice neither experience fighting Tiamat. \n\nEither way, the episode itself was good. I found some problems narratively wise but nothing than letting those slides by hamper my enjoyment. Now they talk about the Sea and a Archipelago. Seeing this setting of many floating islands that is a setting that I look forward seeing, specially to see how the writers put it in the world and how the studio animated it."
