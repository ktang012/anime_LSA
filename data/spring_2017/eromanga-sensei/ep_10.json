It's something believable for some 12 year-old kids, but the ways they called her \"IZUMI-CHAN~\" without even knowing her... \n\nGod, I LOVE interactions between MC and Elf. Even if she is 14, he is 15, so it's still tolerable~~and legal~~. Being naked IN HER OWN HOUSE isn't that wrong... She can do any weird shit because it's her house and isn't bothering anyone, Izumi casually saw her, but forgot it relatively fast, wich is good.\n\nAs for Sagiri... I like her a lot, but the sexualization is unnecessary, there are other ways to make clear she has feelings for her brother. I like how Izumi deals with her, tho, he says stuff like \"Did you fall in love with me?\" or the \"Touch you there\" from the first episode as a joke, because he loves her but makes clear that he wouldn't go for a relationship with her (even if that is clearly going to change, considering the author)."

It was included in the manga (chapter 6):\n\n[Kirino](http://i.imgur.com/J4DNixF.png)\n\n[Kuroneko](http://i.imgur.com/pPVMtKo.png) (I think so)\n\nAt this rate, I'd expect to reach the most recently translated chapter of the manga around episode 10 or 11, considering this one ended around the middle of chapter 9.

   "text": "It's a little late at night for me to type out a ton of thoughts, so I'll just say: I'm enjoying *Eromanga-sensei*. \n\nI have an issue with that little sad story Masamune had when he was speaking with Elf, though. We kind of already established the way he felt about Elf; since their first interaction, he already knew who she was as an author, but he was surprised by her age and her annoying nature. She comes back into the picture this episode, being slightly annoying and cocky, and he reacts accordingly. \n\nThen, *surprise*, after all that is established, he starts talking about how her works in particular actually helped him out in a time in his life where he really needed to be able to laugh. \n\nThere's *no* reason for that to have come out of his mouth so late, besides plot convenience. Like, it's not portrayed like he forgot it and remembered in the moment, or anything like that. It just happens at what feels like the appropriate time, but when you think on it some, it doesn't make too much sense. \n\nNot like I'm holding it to this show to keep the most pristine and perfect writing; that's just a tad annoying, to me. \n\n...Actually, as I'm typing this out, I'm starting to think it was reasonable. It definitely didn't feel reasonable when I was watching it, but it could be argued that he didn't want to tell her what her novels really meant to him when she was acting so bratty and cocky toward him, professing how she was a leagues-better author than him. Might not be the best to tell your cocky rival that they're work means so much to you when you're supposed to be keeping up a rivalry.\n\nI don't know. It's late. "

You're reading too much into this.\n\nNamely Elf's brattish personality initially rubbing him the wrong way that Masamune's pride instantly got in the way of wanting to submit to such a brat. It's only afterwards when they get to know each other better that Masamune could finally open himself to Elf.\n\nIt's the same thing in SaeKano. Eriri admired Kasumi Utako, the author of Metronome in Love, and would do anything to get Kasumi Utako's autograph. But then she discovers Kasumi Utako is none other than Kasumigaoka Utaha, her rival for Tomoya's affection, and Eriri's pride got in the way of ever admitting she liked Utaha's works. It's only recently that Eriri begrudgingly asked for Utaha's autograph."
