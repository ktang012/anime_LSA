Even then they have no idea what the criteria are for being a special titan or what that entails. And then they would have to guess that eating special titans will give you sentience along with their special powers.

It's extremely rare. This close-up of Historia is just a 2D animation with a significant amount of work put into the shading and whatnot."

   "text": "Well that's certainly an interesting conclusion. \n\nAnyway, I'll go a bit more in depth. This particular shot is a close-up of Historia. There's very little movement aside from her hair and facial features. There's no movement in the background going on either. Another thing to point out is that the framerate is higher than what you typically see in AoT. The motion looks very fluid. Does it look a tiny bit odd? Sure. I guess people normally think something looks off when CGI is involved, but that's not the case here. It's the fluid 2D animation that looks a bit odd. 3D character models certainly don't work that way (they're restricted to limb-movements; facial features are almost always ignored) and are rarely (if ever) used for close-ups. Exceptions would be full-CGI anime like Ajin. In AoT you'll only see CGI characters when they're either riding a horse or when very large amounts of people are moving. After all, CGI is used to cut down on production costs and to save time.\n\nSorry for the rant lol. I have a background in VFX and 3D modelling so this is kind of my area of expertise. I can usually tell whether something in anime is CGI or not just by taking a glance (hope I'm not coming off as arrogant by saying that).\n\nAnyway, let me know if you'd like to know more. :P"

She's so miserable inside that it doesn't matter if someone else dies to assure her a martyr's beloved death. She's actually convinced herself of the \"good girl\" aspect so much, because she wants really hard to believe it, but not totally... You can see that something inside recognizes the truth of Ymir's challenge. This is very much how I found it in the manga. Season two continues to knock it out of the park. \n\nI absolutely loved the extra scenes of the trainees learning about Christa's group being missing and preparing to sneak out to help them.  We had very little time with the trainees as trainees compared with the time we've spent with them subsequently, so I enjoy these glimpses.  It reinforces the bonds between the trainees as a group, which I think is important at this point in the story. "

She shared with Historia that she'd died for the joy of many people but got another chance.  Now the secret of her being a shifter is being revealed to everyone, including Historia, and she wants Historia to live up to her promise of living a different kind of life.  \n  \nI mean, up to now, Historia is still strongly playing the Christa persona.  Christa at least tries to be a \"good girl,\" albeit in a somewhat twisted sense.  A \"good girl\" wouldn't keep the secret of a titan shifter from everyone.

   "text": "Good Lord, that was complicated to keep track of.\n\nBy my count, Ymir killed 12 Titans around the tower (and presumably more off-screen). To that, I've added Reiner and Bertolt's friend, since they recognise her as the Titan who ate him.\n\nWhen the Survey Corps turned up, I saw Mikasa kill 3 Titans, and Moblit and Eren one each. A lot of unnamed characters also joined the battle, but I can't add them to the list without knowing who they are. I didn't see any of them twice, though, so none of them would affect the top end of the leaderboard.\n\nAlso, Eren's pride at killing his first Titan suggests that the in-universe count *doesn't* include Titans killed by Titan Shifters. I've therefore relabelled his score of 10 from Series 1 as \"Rogue Titan\", and added him onto the list with his own entry.\n\nAs usual, please let me know if you think I made any mistakes!\n\n*Titans killed by named characters to date:*\n\nCharacter|Kills\n-|-\nLevi|15\nMikasa|14\nDancing Titan|13\nRogue Titan|10\nMike \u2020|5\nNanaba \u2020|3\nAnnie [\ud83d\ude8c](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/689lt3/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_season_2_episode_30/dgxopbg/)|2\nRico|2\nBertolt|1\nConnie|1\nEren|1\nFlagon \u2020|1\nFurlan \u2020|1\nGelgar \u2020|1\nHange|1\nIan \u2020|1\nJean|1\nLynne \u2020|1\nMoblit|1\nReiner|1\nSiss \u2020|1\n**Total**|**77**\n\n*Characters killed by named Titans to date:*\n\nTitan|Kills\n-|-\nFemale [\ud83d\ude8c](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/689lt3/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_season_2_episode_30/dgxopbg/)|29\nColossal|5\nArmoured|3\nBeast|2\n**Total**|**39**\n\n[Previous (Episode 29)](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/66w8h7/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_season_2_episode_29/dglrlw0/) - [Next (Episode 36)](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6gfic1/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_season_2_episode_36/dirg8zc/)"

Driven out of her family, she probably grew up feeling worthless. So of course, she wants her good deeds recognized, instead of intrinsically being a good person.\n\n- Ymir on the other hand, never cares about anyone but herself; yet here she is embracing her darkest secret not once, but twice for the sake of someone else. Even Krista rightfully calls her out on the hypocrisy.\n\n- I actually love that they shuffled the flasback to follow after the initial transformation. Once again, WIT called an audible and it worked out well.\n\n- Hahahaha imagine that was actually Eren's first Titan kill in human form.\n\n- Welp, there's the confirmation. Ymir was the one who killed Reiner & Bert's childhood friend. This will be...awkward..\n\nAnother perfectly paced episode IMO & I know they probably considered rushing it but this was for the best. **And guys, please don't imply anything as that still counts as a spoiler.** Don't we want this done right?"

I felt immersed in the cold, bleak darkness of the mountain. The oppressive atmosphere created a tight focus on Ymir and Krista and, I feel, really shined a light on them as they came to understand each other better.\n\nIt's stuff like that which makes me impatient for each new episode.

I like to say its the female titan's theme, but I'm not 100%.

Welcome\n\n* 'I think you have no intention of saving Daz.' The look in Krista's eyes was the end of the most innocent characters there was. I'll be second guessing her from now\n\n* Ymir is such a Tsundere\n\n* The story doesn't let you off long without a gut wrenching or harsh moment. Ymir's decision to toss Daz down the cliff is just like her personality and way with everything. Good intentions with harsh wrapping\n\n* My guess is that after she kicked Christa down the slope, Ymir turned into a titan so she could carry Daz\n\n* A good anime trope is when it looks like someone is being stopped from going out, except it turns out the other guys are there to go with him/ her. Best German continues his winning, selfless streak from last episode\n\n* 'I brought extra rations!' Sasha is without a doubt the most useful one\n\nAAAAAANNNDDD present day\n\n* That backing drone and the haunted vocals in the remix of Vogel im Kalif when Ymir is leaping down from the tower are wonderful\n\n* I won't be able to take the small titans that seriously. However Ymir is threatening to change that opinion\n\n* Reiner x Krista mome.... uh. Not good. You can stop now. This isn't that kind of moment\n\n* Nicely tying the episode together by having Krista mirror Ymir's speech. Krista was awesome\n\n* Geez, Ymir should teach titan speech classes\n\n* Most of the titans act like compete sloths until they pull off these deadly and vicious strikes\n\n* And the heroes arrive.

Not that she needs to let go of her devotion for Eren, but it would be lovely to see her grow on her own too. And you see a hint of that in one later-ish chapter of the manga (I won't discuss it since idk if you've read the manga - it's nothing big, just one line from Mikasa that stuck out to me), but then again Isayama hasn't really been focusing on any character development for the last like 20 chapters or so.."

   "text": "Found it! I wanted to get the chapter # so I could reference it again. So it was actually more recent than I remembered. The line is in chapter 82 when Armin/Eren launch their plan on the Colossal, right after Eren in Titan form falls down the wall and Armin flies straight at Bertholdt. Mikasa stares toward them and weakly speaks, \"Eren... Armin...\". And right after that she doubles down - \"No. They have their job. We'll get Reiner. If we want to stop Reiner with the three thunder spears, this is the only way.\" And I felt that showed a new insight into Mikasa's (small bit of) development. In the past, Mikasa's whole purpose for joining the Survey Corps was to protect Eren (and Armin). While she did show some noble intention as well (like when she saluted the little girl after threatening the Reeves CEO in like episode 6 & also when she still wanted to kill the female Titan after saving Eren bc \"she killed so many of our comrades\") it always seemed that her primary objective was just to be where Eren was. After reading this line in chapter 82, however, we now see that Mikasa is able to trust Eren and Armin and that, to her, there has been a shift. Even though Eren and Armin are still her everything, she is able to set aside her selfish desires for the advancement of mankind. She has taken to heart her duty as a soldier and is able to allow the possibility of harm befalling Eren and Armin in order to fulfill her purpose and duty of serving mankind. I could be reading into it.. but that's the way I interpreted her actions at least. Still wish she could actually revisit the old grief of her past though, and I remember in an interview once that Isayama said she may be able to return to that happy girl if her youth.. but this manga is so plot-heavy that maybe he just doesn't have time to focus on details of character development. It might be that he's holding off on spotlighting her bc the role of the Ackermans may play a big role beginning soon from what I can tell by reading chapter 93."

If she gives up her few strong bonds - if she's willing to let them go for the sake of humanity - what is left for her personally?  Previously, she couldn't let go because Eren and Armin were all she had, and she needed *something* for herself.  Now it's like she's saying it doesn't matter if she doesn't even have that...  She's in a very lonely place.  (And somewhat like the position that Levi is in, actually.)  Sure, she still has Armin and Eren, but she knows they both only have a few more years.  :/"

So maybe in the beginning his plan was to have them pass, but now I'm wondering if there isn't some kind of plan where the power of titans would be eliminated forever, and the Titan essence living in the shifters would be destroyed, breaking the curse.

But now they can just clear a huge number of titans without a single casualty. I mean, that's the whole reason Eren is significant, because he's humanities only real way of killing titans en mass. And on top of that the area didn't look like it would work well with 3d movement, it seemed relatively wide open with nothing to latch on to.\n\nYmir's death didn't really hit me either. Don't care for her as a character, or the blond chick. I think Historia is quite boring. She's cute though. Truth be told though I wanted her to get eaten by that titan.
