When you have a week between anime episodes, or a month between manga chapters, you have the space to think about the evidence and form theories, some of which might turn out to be true.  But when you binge all the currently-released material in one go, it's just a wild ride with not so much logical analysis going on!"

The \"fight\" with Annie, come on we have seen stronger soldiers get crushed in hands of lesser one and many more times, and cemented in the episode where he planned to throw the titan out the window. If we didn't see Bertolt always hanging out with Reiner I would not guess it but it would mostly because I don't think we had enough time with him and more focus on Reiner."

[And while I haven't snuck ahead in the manga, I'm still betting on](/s \"Pixis giving Eren the flask was sabotage, Krista being the bastard daughter of the King(maybe), I also don't like the fact that everyone gives their heart for the king in salute but never even getting a fucking name for the person they'd die for, although I also think Mikasa sabotaged Eren's belt during the begining of training to get him booted, that her freakish strength is the result of Eren's dad perfecting titan strength without transforming (honestly didn't occur to me til she couldn'tremember in this episode, strongest elite newbie in the squad as well as being a patient of Eren's dad then suddenly having a memory gap in training? Dr. Jaeger said you wouldn't remember after the injection...) and that if this is really set 2000 years in the future, why the fuck can't they sail past the humans turned titans in a goddamn hot air balloon, the only thing i haven't overanalyzed is where Eren's dad went, his broken eyeglasses before injecting Eren makes me so curious, for the last few episodes I've been thinking 'well maybe he's Harambe,' but if that was so he wouldn't be surprised by the soldiers weapons or gas thrusters, which means Harambe most likely comes from another cattle human ranch outside of town... I just really hope they don't pull a walking dead and say everyone will turn into a brainless titan if faced with death by one (like Firefly's original explanation for the Reavers 'The darkness. Kind of darkness you can't even imagine ... A man comes across that kind of will, the only way to deal with it, I suspect, is to become it.') and consume humans for reasons similar to Buso Renkin's homunculus hunger explanation, where their inner desire to be human once again, manifests itself as hunger for the humanity they lost... And after proofreading my ideas, I now realize I have far too much free time.\") "

Earlier dialogs implied those two didn't know about Ymir, but they just now took her. It seems the Beast Titan isn't on any of their sides. And Eren's ability to transform seems like it would be a result of yet another faction. At this rate we're going to find the wall cultists are another faction that can transform.\n\nWith the potential abundance of transforming titans, why were there only two abnormals in the original major attack? Were those two merely going through *that phase* when ending humanity?"

Other Titan powers would allow some extra benefits to royal blood shifters but there's only one so far we know of. In order to inherit the Titan powers, one must be a Titan already (at least so far that we know) so when Eren got the powers, his dad made him a mindless Titan and allowed himself to be eaten; Ymir was a mindless Titan and somehow was able to eat that shifter Titan and thus inherited the power.\")"

To me Ymir and Eren seem to be some simpler form of Titan while Annie, Bertholdt and Reiner are some type of stronger, possibly more advanced Titan. This is mainly evidenced by too things; first, Eren and Ymir's skin in Titan Form seems to be more similar to a regular Titan whereas the others appear to have some type of red muscle showing, perhaps pointing towards a different, stronger process of transformation. Secondly is the increased control that other Shifter Titans show over there bodies, with Annie's icy-looking protective skin, the Colossal being able to expel steam and Reiner's armor. Ymir and Eren seem to be much more simple designs, just kind of jumping around beating shit up. \n\nOk after typing all that it probably seems like I wasted a ton of time ranting but my point is I think it's possible some titans have more of their human characteristics carry over than others."

   "text": "Well, congrats if you made it this far without being spoiled ^^or ^^guessing ^^correctly . I\u2019ve been waiting YEARS for this moment to be animated and WIT fucking delivered.\n\nI\u2019ll admit I wasn\u2019t the biggest fan of how the twist was done in the manga (which seems to be a very unpopular opinion). But I'm tired of arguing about that. [Here\u2019s how the manga did it](http://i.imgur.com/KVO6lAf.jpg), [if you\u2019re curious](http://i.imgur.com/QW4GS9u.jpg).\n\nNeedless to say, I preferred the anime's version, despite not changing anything. Reiner sounded a lot more threatening here, which makes it better for me. That\u2019s the mark of a great adaptation. \n\n- And when you think about his last 24 hours, it\u2019s clear Reiner wasn't in his right mind. Even Bertholdt (who brought up the idea) can\u2019t believe how he approached the situation & I\u2019m with him there.\n\n- But this moment right here is the reason S2 shifted focus onto the side characters, especially Reiner. Building him up as this ultimate bro/hero when he saved Connie\u2019s life, just to make his betrayal sting that much worse. I still get chills when he decided to drop to drop the act and get real.\n\n- AHHH! How bout that scene with my boo Mikasa though! She pounced as soon as Reiner got too close. They kinda censored one of [my](http://i.imgur.com/YHYzDTI.jpg) [favorite](http://i.imgur.com/3LdPnaE.jpg) [moments](http://i.imgur.com/oFhZkN0.jpg) in the whole [manga](http://i.imgur.com/N9WHUK0.jpg) but I'll allow it. She\u2019s forever bae.\n\nWell, every episode has been better than the previous & this is no exception. The occasion needed to be done justice & WIT nailed the most important elements: the overall tone of uneasiness and an improved delivery of the reveal. 10/10.\n\n(Also I made a [post about the foreshadowing throughout the whole show](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/69llsz/anime_spoilers_new_episode_spoilers_a_visual/). And a [compiled imgur album of said post](http://imgur.com/a/aP1zh)  if anyone\u2019s interested.)"

If the show progressed for another 30 seconds you would get the answer to something important.\n\nAt the end of this episode, we know whats going to happen next. They are going to fight. If you want the resolution to the \"whats going to happen next\" question, you don't just go 30 seconds ahead, you go at least 10 minutes ahead.

Reinold sais their goal was to wipe out ALL humanity which would include any humans outside the wall. Ymir could be from there and changed her mind or she could be from a completely different place"

I'm not sure about the source but my google-fu skills have pointed me to a MAL thread saying that this is from a chapter 30-something discussion thread from 4chan. For context, the current episode is an adaptation of chapter 42 and that the manga gets a new chapter only every month. You could review the season 1 of the anime and these clues have been faithfully adapted. There have also been more clues shown after that in later chapters, I'm sure that guy would have spotted them too. Like for example in the previous episode where Bert was seemingly doing something with his hand for a second when Ymir returned to them asking if they want to survive, it was also in the manga and was just as subtle for being near the corner of the page."

That works; it's been set up at least as far back as Reiner's reference to going home in ep29, and perhaps as far back Connie's and Sasha's wishes to visit their homes in ep26. Reiner's matter-of-fact confession was surprising, but I could immediately rationalize it. On the other hand, Eren's reaction, with his apparent matter-of-fact consideration of Reiner's proposal, was much more disconcerting until the flashback explained it.\n\nOne thing that ended up bugging me is Eren again refuses to accept Armin's suspicions (of Reiner and Bertholdt in this episode, and of Annie in ep24). I can't quite accept that Eren would repeat this mistake a week or so later. I guess he really is an idiot. At least it didn't interfere with his transformation this time; that's progress, I suppose."

   "text": "I\u00b4m the king of not getting spoiled. I had a hunch that Reiner was a titan based on his hair. AoT has never been very subtle when it comes to the titan designs. I really liked the callbacks to Reiners suspicious behaviour in S1: makes me want to rewatch everything!\n\nI read a few manga-reader posts here saying they like the anticlimactic betrayal, and normally I'm a sucker for anticlimax, but this just didn't do it for me. Maybe this scene will make more sense when we get to hear what their plans *exactly* are, but I cannot think of a single scenario where this dialogue would make sense. \n\nWhy now after 3 years? Was the pressure too much? If you need Eren for your plan, the worst thing you can do is show him that you're actually the titan who's the source of all his anger. Has Reiner just gone mad? If so, I don't like that development either.\n\nSpeaking of Eren's anger, I like that S2 focuses a little on Eren having to restrain himself. He's always been boiling, seething with rage, clouding his judgement. And he has to restrain himself, which is where we could get some much-needed character development. If that's the case, I would've liked to see that when Reiner confessed to him; how he desperately tries to keep his cool.\n\nOverall, AoT has always gone by insanely fast. It never feels like 25 minutes, but more like 5. I guess that confirms that I'm having a great time watching this at least, even though it's a pretty 'simple' show, and even though I'm fairly certain I won't like where the series is heading."

That means that we basically missed all of the internet culture surrounding the show, even to the extent that we didn't know there were people who transform into titans. So yeah, we were completely blind.\n\nHaving watched it all in one blast, we were pretty suspicious of Rein. Legitimately as soon as Eren turned into a titan we suspected him because he has the same hair as the armored titan. A dumb reason, but when we saw Anne's titan form and how her hair was pretty much the same that solidified it some more. We caught a few of the other references too, *especially* when Rein got \"squished\" in Anne's hand and was steaming afterwards. We thought it could have been blood-steam, but since we already suspected him we also thought it probably wasn't.\n\nAs for how it was revealed... no, not what we were expecting at all haha. It seemed weirdly way too casual, *especially* with Mikasa standing *right there*. Also, I am not a fan of the \"12 hours earlier\" style cutting in almost any show, it more takes me out of the moment and annoys me more than anything else. Ah well, I'm really interested to see the direction it goes from here. We still have a lot of questions regarding... well everything."

Bertholt totally caught me off guard, though. Anyway, it seems that Reiner and Bertolt at least knew something about the Beast Titan if you go back and watch when they saw him walking by the castle. They had an extremely concerned look on their faces, while the others just seemed confused. Also, since the wall wasn't breached and there were no dead in Conny's village but also the buildings were destroyed, it seems to me that the Beast Titan is either turning people into Titans or awakening them (perhaps they already are Titans, but unaware?). This has only seemed to affect people in the smaller villages, though. "

So me and my buddy here are the principal antagonists that pretty much set the last five years of your life into complete chaos. Wanna come chill with us?\" *WHAT WAS HE THINKING?!?* And why, with him being the Armored Titan, get spooked so badly into revealing himself to Eren? So many questions still remain...  \n\nBut by God was this heavy. The two primary antagonists are now on the field and are ready to engage the Scouts. I have no idea how this is going to play out now. Clearly people are going to die. Especially seeing as how the Colossal Titan seem pretty invincible I have no clue how they plan on winning. And we still have 6 more episodes to go. This is going to weigh on me for a while.\n\nLastly I must commend Reiner on playing it so completely straight for the last 3 years. He was everyone's big bro and seemed so genuinely concerned with helping his squadmates but it was all an act. He's the most despicable form of traitor. Annie and Bertholt being the quiet ones made them easy targets to be wary of. But how could anyone suspect Reiner?Brilliant acting on his part.

Maybe before, he was able to ignore the consequences of his actions, but interacting with humans up close, going through hardships together, and starting to care about them, even if just a tiny bit, made that much harder.\n\nWhich is probably what drove him to try to get Eren to come with him peacefully.

So heres the big question, if they wanted to fuck humanity why did they ever bother joining the army? Dicking around for 3 years? Why not just go bash another gate in? Eren doesnt seem to have a cooldown on transforming (well, not a 3 year one anyway) so they shouldnt. I guess they must have been looking for something that eren is key to (maybe him being able to transform, and something to do with the basement/his dad?) because otherwise they would have joined the MP to be clsoer to bigwigs I guess. \n\nSo, every badass character seems to either die or be a titan so far so i guess mikasa has something going on (or will get some magic potion transformation thing to save eren at some point), erwins too badass to not be killed off soon probably with levi?

The initial breach was cover for them to infiltrate the region. They probably used the first few years learning about the culture etc (with the beast titans reaction to the gear there is a good chance they knew nothing about the people living in the walls) pretending to be refugees of the breach before joining the military after finding out access to the inner walls is restricted and it was their only way to get in without destroying everything.\n\nTheir roles are very specific too. The two who are required to breach the inner walls if needed joined the survey corps while Annie joined the military police to gain access to the inner wall where she could search for what they were looking for. The fact that Annie tried to take Eren and they said they could leave in peace if Eren goes with them however makes it seem like they believe he is what they wanted after all, however after transforming Bertolt did grab Ymir so it's likely they are looking for people who can transform in particular."

I can't remember if they used it in s1 when he broke the wall etc. 3D models keep on getting better and I'm excited about that. I loved how they looked in Ace Attorney 6 and I think snk could pull it off.\n\nGosh Eren took a while chilling in his hand before he transformed too. The latest episodes have all ended so well, let's see how the fight is going to be!"

With those 4 plus the 3 previous and probably some time before that's at least 7 years out of the given 13.  So how much time does Reiner have left before giving it to a successor?\")\n\nAlso, where the fuck are they gonna park this?  They're halfway through the season and it's been hype as fuck the entire time.  Dammit.  Why did they only want to give 12 episodes.  Manga readers have been suffering for too long to have a wider audience to discuss this."

(Even if she's actually a titan too I still don't understand his feelings at all) \nWhy would he not hate all titans after that flashback we kept seeing from him?\nWhy does he save Ymir if she is a titan who has gone against his main goal of wiping out humanity by killing a bunch of titans and saving humans?\nWHY THE FUCK DO EVIL TITANS KEEP HIDING AMONGST HUMANS IN THE FIRST FUCKING PLACE, DO NOTHING TO ADVANCE THEIR GOALS FOR AGES, THEN SUDDENLY REVEAL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE JUST TURNED UP AS TITANS AND NOT DONE THE WHOLE INFILTRATION THING ANYWAY?!?!\n\nI want to believe that the author is super clever and has convenient answers to these problems, and that the great mystery will be concluded in a satisfying way in the end but frankly I'm starting to lose hope that this isn't just a \"Lost\" type situation where more and more weird, inexplicable shit keeps happening and there will be no good answer to any of it by the end... if there ever is an end.\n"

Most anime or manga reveal shit and its right in your face on screen or in big panels. The reveal of the colossal and armored titan(two of humanities biggest enemies so far and the indirect reason for Eren's mother's death) happened in a side conversation in the background. Seriously in the manga it was in small text that looked almost like sfx that some people skipped over. Its not as subtle in the anime of course that would be harder with subtitles, and I'd imagine dub would make it easier. However just the subtleness and how causally Reiner dropped the lines like he was asking Historia to marry him was great.\n\n[Spoilers](/s \" Not a big spoiler, but I'm so fucking pumped for the ADVANCE scene. Zero fucks were given when home dude was getting eaten by a titan and he yelled to his squad to fucking advance towards the objective. My memory is sketchy, but doesn't Ymir join in as well? I don't think they get two chances at grabbing Eren so I like to think so\")"

   "text": "So, this is probably the wrong episode to make this observation and I'm pretty sure that I'm not the first to do this, but I started thinking about the designs of the titans.\n\nInterestingly (and probably not surprisingly), Eren is by fair the most human-looking of the \"interesting\" titans. He and Ymir were the only two to have skin, and her proportions were odd in a way that makes her much closer to the uncanny valley. However Eren's design is *very* human; the only things that are notably different are his genitals and face, which have more mild differences than many of the other titans.\n\nThis also got me thinking about Ymir. Given how she was talking about her past, I'm almost certain that she used to be part of whatever \"village\" or place that Annie, Reiner, and Bertolt were from and ran away for whatever reason. Note Reiner's reaction last episode when he noticed that she could read some unknown language. \n\nI find it very interesting that her design was just that of a regular smaller titan; I suspect there's likely an entire \"village\" where the major transform to regular-looking titans, which would make Annie, Reiner, and Bertolt (and perhaps the Beast Titan) special in some way. And I suppose Eren too. This makes me wonder if the drug injected into Eren is normally used to enhance a \"regular\" transforming titan to a unique titan.\n\nAnyway, lots of observations, though not very organized. I might repost these speculations in a more organized manor in a future episode discussion."

During the episode, the only people who weren't certain they were titans was the non-manga reading audience and I guess Eren's typically skeptical ass."

I mean fuck, these two are directly responsible for the death of his mother, who was the driving motivation for him. Even to the end, he was trying to stay leveled and just go along with the plan of getting them somewhere indoors and then questioning them.\n\nBased on their reactions, I'm assuming Bert and Reiner were spies for the titans who eventually began to love humans while spying on them, and began to regret the loss of their comrades, and Reiner finally decides to commit to his job despite his feelings."

They just looked too purposefully identical, especially the hair on the armored titan, and once that was in the back of my head the entire scenario with Annie-as-Titan made way more sense (especially him taking off his hood so she could clearly identify him when they made a point of trying to remain hidden so she wouldn't attack for fear of killing eren by mistake) and a few other plot holes. \n\nAll that said though, when s2 began and it showed a few flashbacks about the duo seeing their friend die during their travels, and his continued desires to make historia into his Waifu, I felt silly for ever suspecting him AND THEN THIS FUCKING EPISODE HAPPENED AND I FEEL LIKE A PROPHET"

However, it seems that they can [alternatively achieve their goal](http://i.imgur.com/gstvSyU.png) (whatever that is...) by capturing Eren and Ymir and taking them back to their [\"hometown\"](http://i.imgur.com/Bex0OxP.jpg), without having to kill everyone.\n\nBert sets things into motion when he suggests that it [might be a good time to go for their plan B](http://i.imgur.com/xxqjivk.png). It does seem like a good opportunity: they are on top of the wall next to titan territory, Ymir is incapacitated and Eren is hanging out alone right next to them. If they wait longer then Eren and Ymir might become inaccessible and they also risk getting captured. Reiner and Bertholdt knew they were being investigated because they were sent away without their equipment at the start of the season, and indeed Hange was already planning on setting a trap for them. However, Reiner certainly didn't carry the plan very well:\n\nEren: [Did you really think that I would just say \"sure, let's go?\"](http://i.imgur.com/6MZ9Av7.png)  \nReiner: [Oh shit what did I just do?](http://i.imgur.com/v7oiYG6.png)  \nBertholdt: [Oh shit what did this idiot just do? <sweats profusely>](http://i.imgur.com/fSYnS73.png)\n\nSo yeah, I would say that \"being tired of this shit\" was probably a big factor behind why things turned out the way they did. Reiner in particular is having a hard time dealing with everything and has been behaving erratically lately."

It should provide more story and revelations if we see where those 2 came from and what they're going back to their home for.\n\nMaybe we get some explanation on how people can be transformed into Titans, why their appearances vary so greatly, and a whole bunch of other questions"

Of course the suspicions were atrocious and he had twelve hours to think about and contemplate it, but he still gave of a lot of nothing. He could have given off some shock for the suspicion being verified or concern like \"whoa you reeeeally need some rest, Reiner\" Hell, I'd be satisfied with a smirk, not a full laugh, but a smirk at the thought that these close friends of him starting the landslide that got his mother killed.\n\nBeautiful show, wonderful writing, but I don't remember it being so emotionless in the manga.\n\nedit: the 3d animation looks good. good on them for that"

Since he was a kid back then, I assume that he, Reiner and Annie did not grow up inside the walls if they're from the same \"village\". Reiner also said something about something happening when they were kids, could that be somehow related to the titan that looked liked Yimir? I also suspect that Yimir is also from behind the walls, with her knowing that language on the tin and having a \"fake\" identity.\n\n[Pure speculation](/s \"I made a post some time ago about people sacrificing themselves and bulding the walls in their titan form. I bet the castle was built BEFORE the walls and the unknown language is a language that died off after the walls were built. I also think that there's some way to perhaps learn to become a titan. In the ED there's children of a royal family eating what probably is human flesh, that could have something to do with gaining the ability. Since now we know that Historia has royal blood and she is considered to be important by the wall cult people who know something about the titans, the royalty, whatever it is, might have something to do with the titans. Were the titan attacks an inside job? Do they consider the titan form to be the next step in evolution or something, which is why they want to kill all humans?\")\n\nAlso, the Colossal Titan is bald, while all the other known human titans have hair that is at least somewhat simillar to their human form. I wonder if there's something going on here?"

As a manga reader it pains me that this season being so short will only feature titan fights and not all the ,really important stuff that will happen in the next arc that will push the story forward again into their true objective of regaining wall maria and getting to eren's basement and more ... a lot more.\n\nI've seen people on the web say that another 12 episodes will maybe release in autumn but there's no indicator of it yet. If those other 12 episodes are false and they take another 4 years to make another 12 episodes I can't imagine the anime series ever getting an ending.\n\nCurrently people speculate the manga MAYBE ending in chapter 120-125 (latest being 93) which is roughly about 2 more years of monthly 45 page chapters ,in retrospective this 12 anime eps will end in chapter 50 of the manga. I you are still reading ,then it should be clear what im getting to... they wont finish complete animation of the series until aproximately 2030\n\nTLDR; it saddens me to think this series if animated fully could possibly end until 2030 if they take 4 years for each 12 new episodes."

I well and truly love the show, and am feeling and immense amount of disappointment right now. \n\nObviously how casual it was is a big problem of mine. For the sake of argument, I'll say it don't even care about it not feeling important to me as a viewer, but it didn\u2019t feel important to the characters either. Lacking the usual flare for the dramatics the show has made it seem so throwaway. Part of what makes me love the show are the gut wrenching reaction the characters have to the constant despair they undergo. I don't feel like we got that here at all. And the conversation that led up to it was incredibly wonky, even for Attack on Titan. \n\nNow it just seems like Isayama decided that brutal deaths of beloved characters where old news and the big new hook would be revealing numerous people of the 104th to be Titans. Kinda like how in True Blood by like season 4 everyone in that terrible show was becoming some sort of fantastical creature. I get that the reveal had to happen at some point but on the back of Ymir speaks to the pacing issues I've had with the past few episodes. It's going a mile a minute and shoving big reveals into every episode, not giving them time to breath, be digested by the audience, and have a tangible impact on the characters before the next twist.\n\nYes, I've read a lot of the comments in here about the \"clever\" foreshadowing they've been doing since the first season but I think that is all ruined by the fact that it was damn obvious who the Armored Titan was around the same time it was made obvious who the Female Titan was. Unlike with the Female Titan, not everyone in the Scouts knew or even suspected that there would be more people like Erin. As a viewer I thought it became obvious before the reveal that Annie was the one, because of the Females Titan's face was so similar.\n\nBut for Riener, I'm wondering why they didn't immediately say \"hey, don't you think Riener looks like the Armored Titan? Maybe we should take form a plan.\"\n\nI was admittedly a little surprised by Bertolt being the Colossal Titan because I had somewhat forgotten he existed until the last episode. But that should be obvious to the Scouts. They should have suspected Riener right away and then said\" whose the tall fucker he's always paling around with? Maybe, just maybe, they're the pricks who keep breaking our damn walls.\"\n\nI'm really hoping I have some epiphany and my enjoyment of the show returns, but fuck. I've not turned on a show this hard...maybe ever. \n\nSo if anyone can help me rationalize this shit, I'd really appreciate it."

They really handled that information reveal backwards. It should have been the scene of Hange explaining her suspicions first. Have the cast doubt it though and build a sense of tension and fear. \n\nIt could have been this really uneasy moment of them all atop the wall felling nervous and paranoid arou d Reiner and Bertolt. Then as Reiner starts acting strange it would be the signal that yes, this all well and truly fucked. There are no winners in this situation, just despair. Like the show has handled so well in the past. \n\nIt could of been a Red Wedding like moment.

It's this mess where are the right pieces are there, they just tried to be artsier than they are capable of with non-linear scenes.

I know it is not factual, to be staved with data but my feeling with most of the episodes here is that this anime is trying too much to build it's plot as a season whereas in my opinion it neglects the episodic nature of how anime airs. It is good as a marathon but not something to watch one episode of every week. The writing also feels a bit of a loose projectile, constantly shifting to other paths of the story without resolving anything which is frustrating to watch/read to me. Perhaps this is because i have read the manga until somewhere after the introduction of Kenny Ackermann but it felt like too much of a big story that Hajime thought of too many different ideas that contribute to a main plotline but the way it is written it loses it's strength because of this. It is not the same but it feels similar to Kingdom Hearts in the sense that the plot becomes a clusterfuck of plotlines that are meant to contribute to one story which makes it hard to keep track of everything. \n\nThis episode in particular felt bad to me because the episode had another sequence of flashback to make it feel like the story is a huge mystery while it isn't. On top of that it made and still makes no sense to me how Reiner was revealing himself to Eren. Eren's reaction too makes no sense, he has been shown the proof 12 hours earlier. It makes he wants to believe in people he considers friends but how he stayed frail during the whole segment made no sense considering this is a story where the characters, especially, Eren are supposed to be distraught, perhaps emotionally void because of the traumatic experiences they have collected over the years. To further this it actually makes no sense that he did manage to shift so quickly when he was grabbed. I feel if this is the plot they wanted to go for he would have stayed paralysed during that whole segment to either be saved by the team or be captive by them. Mikasa's reaction in that regards was a lot more natural in my opinion. \n\nI think this is what my feelings are, i really want to like the story but i have always felt like it misses something to make it a 9 or 10 as a show for me. The series is by no means bad, nobody can deny that but it should not be devoid of criticism like shows like these tend to be."

This season has been a minefield for reveals and hints. Just because we don't get answers now doesn't mean we won't later and it doesn't mean  what we've had is pointless. \n\nAnime is best if it's only episodic? Please no. SNK is one of countless anime that is a cohesive plot, that's what we like about it. You wouldn't have a long, engaging story that we can theorise and talk about if it kept resetting. \n\n> This episode in particular felt bad to me because the episode had another sequence of flashback to make it feel like the story is a huge mystery while it isn't.

Us anime only watchers can only guess. \n\nEren's reaction does make sense. In the flashback he's in denial, then at the walls he's obviously trying to go along with the act. He's learned from what happened with Annie and is trying to be more subtle, and react quicker since he isn't quite as shocked. Characters get boring if they always act the same way.

   "text": "I read the manga. I know the motives and I know the mysteries, I just think everything about the way AoT is handled is shallow and haphazard. Not just this one episode. \"You only see surface level stuff\" Dude, there's nothing BUT surface level stuff. There's no deep hidden meaning in it. There's not anything profound. It's just mainstream popcorn entertainment. Furthermore, I wasn't talking surface level shit before, I was talking about presentation. The animation wasn't good at all. The cgi looked bad and didn't fit in with the rest of the show. The armored titan didn't even move, they just slid still images of him and inserted sound effects and camera pans to simulate his movements. \"Goofy and uncreative\" is the perfect way to describe the way people use swords in the show. Every single attack is exactly the same; just spin around fast. Nah, the animation budget is super low and it shows. They're cutting corners left and right. Nothing about AoT says \"masterpiece\". It just has cool music. EDIT: To answer a couple of your dumber questions: I never found what Reiner said interesting because I don't care about any of the characters. They're all boring and I don't care what happens to them, therefore I don't care about their conflicts with titans or whatever. Yes, of course I know Reiner gave himself away because of his mental state, they fucking said it in the episode. My problem with the reveal itself is that it tries to do the casual throwing it out there thing, but then immediately invalidates that by treating their transformations like BOOOM THE MOST INTENSE IMPORTANT THING EVAAAAAARRRR. Conflicting ideas thrown together haphazardly, and yaaaay more flashbacks! Who the hell calls this shit \"well planned out\"? The writer just makes up backstory whenever. The more I think about it, the more I dislike the show, honestly. "

   "text": "HOLY SHIT THAT BACKGROUND TRUTH BOMB THO. WILL EDIT THIS WHEN I FINISH, BUT DAMN. EREN IS WAY TOO CHILL WITH THIS RIGHT NOW. \n\n\n\"Hey Eren, I know you're super prone to fits of rage, but we attacked your town and indrectly killed your mom, and ~~are enemies of humanity, with the goal of wiping it out.~~ Please come with us to avoid it.\"\n\n\nBoi why was Eren so chill.\n\n\nBOI WHAT THEY TRYNA PLAY IT OFF AS GOING CRAZY? ITS TOO SPECIFIC TO BE CRAZY.\n\n\nEdit: Finished\n\n\nHonestly I think this episode was really fucking bad. They reveal 2 titans' identities in a single episode with almost no emotion, and it made no sense to reveal it. Even Bertholt thought it was dumb. I assume there's a reason why they need more titan shifters, and that was Reiner's way of trying to convince Eren to come with him? But sincethey were already pretty good buddies, it would make more sense to pull a Connie and be like \"oh man I wanna check out my village, I need help, please help me Eren\" instead of saying \"I am a serial killer with the full intent of wiping everyone out, but I might not need to if you come, k buddy?\"\n\n\nIt just felt so rushed. And he revealed not only his identity in a rushed way, but Bertholt's as well. When we just learned last episode that Ymir was also a Titan shifter (though apparently like Eren in which she doesn't seem like she's working with Annie & the fuck-humanity-squad).\n\n\nThen he gives a pretty bad speech about how stupid the humans he's met are, as a way of psyching himself back up and going full-ass on being a villain.\n\n\nThen they give a quick-ass montage to give us Eren's determination to transform, but it was so (ironically) half-assed. \n\n\nWhen the Scouts planned around confronting Annie, it was so intense. An episode was even given in her perspective for a while, and they made this intricate plan, and Eren was given a whole scene of being so unsure that it was Annie, as he thought of her as a comrade. Then they try to get Annie down underground, but she stops, and they have this growing confrontation and dread that was so nail-biting, up to her transforming. Then Eren has a big deal of being unable to transform because he can't get the determination to, as he's so conflicted since Annie is his comrade. It so very well developed, given plenty of time to develop. But then they tried to do it all again in a single episode, with obvious parallels like the flashback scene explaining they suspect the Shifter, then people trying to act normal around the shifter, they shifter getting put in a corner (or in the dumb case of Reiner, putting himself in a corner), then them shifting, Eren being shocked and confused, and finally getting his determination. Except it was so poorly done and rushed.\n\n\nYou think Reiner's reveal could be an even bigger deal, because while he trained with Annie and respected her, Reiner was much more friendly compared to Annie who kept everyone at a distance, making his twist seem much more two-faced and hurtful. Especially since he was one of the ones who attacked his town and helped cause the death of his mother, and essentially the ruining of Eren's life. At least Annie didn't break down the walls.\n\n\nJust everything about the reveals was so rushed, ruining them. I don't think they could have done a worse job. I mean, I don't mind a quick, sudden reveal compared to a drawn-out one. But they even did the whole \"flashback scene where it turns out everyone is already suspicious.\" And then a montage of Eren feeling betrayed and getting angry before transforming. Except worse in every way compared to the first time.\n\n\nIf you're going to make it different, go full-ass. Make Reiner serious and not wishy-washy, threatening Eren and blackmailing him to go with him. Make Eren surprised, make everyone not know. Keep Eren's transformation for the next episode at least, or damn, maybe he's curious about why they care about home base and uses that noggin and decides to see where they go and why. Maybe not reveal it to everyone else and have the next few episodes super tense while Reiner convinces the higher ups to take a squad to his town, while Eren is on eggshells wondering if he or Bertholt (bigger problem) transforms.\n\n\nAlso CGI Collossal Titan looks pretty bad.\n\n\nI know this is how the manga did it, and again, I'm fine with a shocker, different reveal, but they shouldn't have repeated the whole \"flashback all Scouts know\" thing again, and rushed Eren's transformation. I really think it would've been way better if it was a secret to everyone else, and they tried to get to their village with Eren without raising suspicion. The flashback and Eren's quick betrayal-montage transformation just made it feel like a cheap, rushed imitation of Annie's reveal. Eren's \"Traitors!\" scene just felt so half-assed when it could've been so emotional."

But he was never in any real danger of dying; the first time it was to Annie, who wasn't killing him, and the second was a titan biting his arm, and we know titan shifters can regenerate, so he wasn't in any real danger. If he thought he was going to die, he could've shifted, and made sure there were no survivors. With his armored form, he definitely had a chance of surviving, and certainly escaping.\n\n\nSo nothing really should have triggered his PTSD.\n\n\nAnd that doesn't excuse the other stuff that was pretty bad. I don't mind a sudden reveal, but they copied what they did for Annie's reveal again, just in a worse, rushed way. They re-did the flashback \"Scouts already suspicious of shifter\" scene, and redid Eren's betrayal/anger montage transformation. Again, if they wanted to make it different, they should've gone all the way. Make no one know or suspect, so they don't interrupt the shocking scene with a badly-inserted flashback, make it actually sudden. Make Eren go along with it to protect the others instead of another \"I'm mad and need to fight so I'm gonna have flashback montages\" transformation."

   "text": "Well for one, there was less evidence for Annie being the titan. For Reiner & Bertholt, they both came from the same place as Annie, Reiner was part of the squad who thought Eren was in the right wing and Annie attacked from the right, Reiner was inquisitive on where Eren actually was, then Annie ran off in that direction after getting her hand cut by Reiner. \n\n\nMuch more evidence for them being titans. Not to mention that Reiner then *directly and calmly told Eren he and Bertholt were titans.* He should've believed it without a doubt then.\n\n\nAnd when he finally did accept it, his flashback montage and \"traitors\" yell was much less emotional than when it happened with Annie, yet it should've been more emotional because he was closer to Reiner than he was to Annie."

The flashbacks shoved in there to make you feel things were shitty writing, the animation was shitty, the cgi looked repulsive, Eren's crying face was gross and Mikasa's spin-around-a-lot style was goofy and uncreative. Good music alone does not equal a 10/10. Mediocre show is still mediocre."

It's the same with Attack on Titan and The Walking Dead. It's shit, but the characters scream a lot and act like everything is the most important thing ever, so people watch it solely for the basic human instinct of seeking drama. Character deaths are not interesting if the characters themselves are boring. "
