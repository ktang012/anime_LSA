I think these are potentially interesting concepts and characters, but *wow* was that a chore to sit through. The episode was essentially characters standing around talking in very, very monotonous voices while the director got so bored that he just started showing backgrounds with power lines. \n\n24 episodes... man, I really want this to be good, but so far I feel all the hype within me has been crushed."

Actions are in all cases made due to some selfish desire. His philosophy seems to me be based on a categorical error. At least he is self consistent though.\n\n> Meanwhile, he's \"disinterested\" and doesn't seem to have emotional motivation and instead imitates the righteous with only a brief mention of him being selfish.\n\nYeah, he clearly still has lots of room for improvement in his way of thinking. Maybe this'll leave room for character growth? We also don't know all that much about him yet, maybe we'll get more insight later on.\n\n> I think other shows like Monogatari handled the topic much better, both in presentation and application/setting/plot.\n\nMonogatari sure is well ahead in presentation specifically. As for setting and plot I really think it's too early to say with just one episode to go on. Even if it ends up only half as good as Monogatari it'd still mean it's worth watching to me."

   "text": "tl;dr: I liked the show, and its discussion of ethics interested me. I completely get why people wouldn't like this, but might I direct you all to a show which promised much with a similar setting and had more flash, but failed to deliver: Charlotte. \n\nThe ones in charge of the show didn't seem to have taken advantage of anime as a medium to craft a potentially more entertaining story. It feels...literary. Like it was meant to be consumed as a book and not something to be watched with images. That's probably the main problem (not that I mind, but many seem to) with this adaptation so far. It gets some questions out of the way, but does not have a hook for those seeking entertainment. \n\nCompare this to something like Charlotte which had a flashy start and turned into a steaming pile of garbage by the end. I think I prefer the way Sakurada Reset is going about things. They have super powers, but the ones wielding them have a moral code. Of course they don't talk or feel like high schoolers; it's realistic in the sense that people wielding such powers shouldn't be feeling at all normal. \n\nInstead, these atypical high-schoolers' questions are relatively more big-picture and abstract: 'I have a reset ability but do not wish to harm others, so I will set up rules to ensure this does not happen.' This is at once a mature mindset, yet also immature; Haruki resets every time someone is crying in the belief that if she can stop them from crying, the problem will be solved. \n\nWe learn later that her mindset comes from her childhood experiences of shouldering the burden of sadness around her as if it were her own, thus losing sight of what it means to experience sadness that is her own. And Souma (we barely know anything about her, but I'm liking her manner of speech, which is colourful as is expected of an Aoi Yuuki-voiced role) thinks Kei's powers complement Haruki's and wants them to work together.\n\nNow you might be wondering why the fuck any of this matters if you were thoroughly bored out of your mind watching this. Sure, this isn't a 'fun' first episode, but it sure is thought-provoking. For a show seemingly targeted at teens (high school setting), it might not be doing the 'right' things. But Sakurada Reset goes above and beyond what shows like Charlotte completely fail to address for the sake of entertaining the audience, to considering the ethics of superpowers...which doesn't seem interesting outside of a philosophy classroom. Whatever. I like Sakurada Reset's first episode, and will be following the series. \n\nAlso, the ending with Mari being a 'fake' has me interested and the ED is pretty great. The OST playing during Haruki's memory scene was particularly striking as well. \n\n\n\n"

However, the premise is expansive enough that it could chew through an entire 3-4 episodes if it were done effectively (or perhaps an entire cour if they wanted to make it believable on top).  In order to crash the premise down into 1ep, well, this is what you get.\n\nAs a specific comparison, I would say that this gives me the same vibes as trying to understand the entire first season of FSN UBW in 1 episode without having any exposure to the Fate route beforehand.  In other words, maybe jumping cold right into UBW season 2.\n\nBottom line is that this show may or may not go interesting places well or poorly, but the first episode is just ... bad.  So it goes."

As in, it'll be the cool thing to hate on, while some people such as myself actually like it.\n\nI'm a huge fan of shows where the cast have varying powers or abilities,so that's a pretty good hook for me. Characters are actually logical instead of being emotional messes that don't understand when to just shut up. Should be fun to see how this show uses the powers to its advantage."

(the first one is 3 episodes, and will probably involve the young girl).\n\nHOWEVER, everything else is terrible.\nThe characters: Lifeless, emotionless, empty. Their character designs are pretty bad, and they seem to have no personality\nThe dialogue: Boring, very very boring. The whole episode seemed like there was no development.\nThe art/animation: There is no animation, many still frames, and no movement, no expression. With so many still frames you would expect great artstyle (e.g. kuzu no honkai), but the art looked terrible. Empty, no people, no nature, no light, nothing.\n\nHonestly, if this was a 12 episode anime, I would probably watch the next 2 episodes, to at least finish the first arc, but this is a 24, and with so many anime coming out (especially 2-cours), I don't think I can handle this. No, thank you"
