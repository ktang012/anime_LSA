Azazel and Kaisar's interactions, human advancements and their usurping both heaven and hell, demon slavery, dragon people that don't seem to fit the angel/human/demon model... And we're only on the second episode.\n\nED was pretty cute. Some development post-credits, too. [Today's endcard is Azazel](https://i.imgur.com/Qo3NYG6.jpg)!"

Azazel should stop being so forceful on Nina. Thank goodness Rita was there to put him in his place. \n\nRita is fun to see as always. That little hand she has as an assistant is a... bit too specific. I mean, the existence of this hand will surely hint a moment in the story where literally no one can do a move and it will time for the hand to give a hand (Pun intended) to get everyone free.\n\nIn the encounter of Kaisar with Azazel, I'm with Kaisar. If Azazel keeps killing people this only will give Charioce the justification so the citizens and everyone go in a rampage and kill demons, and seeing how easily they hindered Azazel in the end of the episode, the moment they have the support of the citizen they will raid every demon to the ground. \n\nAnd with Nina: We learned that she does know that she transforms into a Dragon, and that her village is one that is full of half-dragon people that can transform. Something with her transformation seems to be particular though, since she doesn't seem to remember her time being a Dragon, something that it doesn't seems to be the case with the other half-dragon people. And the existence of this half-dragon people seems to be a secret in itself. This gives into the question that maybe Bahamut is itself a half-dragon that could have lost control that comes from this village, and as Nina itself when Bahamut transformed it lost control. It is an interesting thing to think about, and Nina is surely a charming MC to look for :)\n\nThis ED... I didn't expected it to be this cutesy xD, I laughed when Favaro passed in the background behind bars. I also saw someone that looks an awful lot like Amira, but it is for a brief moment so I can be wrong. The little \"Holy Chid\" appears almost at the end with another clothes. Kaisar seems the perfect handsome dude for Nina. Azazel still is an ass with Nina. And even Glasses-kun, the one that we saw in one of the PVs, appears at the very end.\n\nI'm loving the show so far. It is great :)"

He's aiding abetting the very man who allows and promotes all these atrocities to go on. And also he knows all the bad that's happening, knows how horrible it is, and yet does NOTHING. Like Azazel said, it actually make him lower than the people actually doing the real crimes. Even Rita is helping in her own way. What is Kaiser doing nothing. \nSo, right now, Azazel is doing the only thing he can to free his people even though he knows his own power isn't enough.

I mean, he isn't killing demons, that alone would put him above the ones that actually are killing them or putting them into slavery. \n\nYeah, he isn't doing something either, but I believe it is not because he thinks everything that is happening is something just. I believe that he is not doing anything because only killing the humans doing the abuse and the killing would enable Charioce the support of the citizens of the kingdom to kill all demons, and Kaisar knows pretty well that he can do that. It doesn't matter how powerful the Holy Child is, I don't think he can win against a battalion of magic armoured soldiers.\n\nKaisar isn't taking the easy way out, that is killing the humans, and that puts him above those humans that abuse and kill demonkind. He just can't devise a plan to save the demonkind without afterward Charioce killing them all, and that puts him even above Azazel, that is just taking the easy way out with a plan that is destined to fail and be the demise of all demonkind in the end. He needs to take a couple of steps back and take a look to what he is doing, and maybe team with Kaisar instead of fighting him so Kaisar would act as some kind of spy and together free demonkind with a fraction of the struggle and problems Azazel faces everytime he goes in Batman mode."

I don't expect the anime to go into these ideas in any major way (I'd love to be wrong), but just having them there gives the plot more to work with and ultimately a greater sense of substance.\n\nOf course, the fantasy, comedy, and action should be more than enough.

Seriously, for two seasons now it has had many moments that have surprised me with their originality for a fantasy setting or just direction/style for anime!\n\n* Plate armor actually works in a fantasy anime, what sorcery is this?\n\n* Human civilization where the \"king\" (Emperor I'd say) just marches his army into the strongholds both of Angels and Demons to wreck their shit is fucking BADASS\n\n* Kaisar has so far been a prime example of how a Lawful Good Paladin-type should be played. He doesn't go full Lawful Stupid when shown things that conflict his ideals, instead he argues about the methods how to fix them. Also the overall direction was 10/10 in the Demon Lab-scene.\n\n* I actually think it's interesting and funny how the MC reacts to all handsome males, since my thought throughout the series has been that everyone looks so fucking amazing that it's ridiculous. \n\n* Speaking of handsome males, the rag demon/Azale has great comedy moments when he's dragged down a notch by dense MC or otherwise.\n\n* I don't think I've heard VA like the female main's for a while, it's memorable and I like it.\n\n* Give a raise for the character designer, Rita's helping hand is the best character of the season!"

I'm also very interested in all the secrecy behind Mugaro, I'm guessing he'll play the role of a key character just as Amira did in genesis.\n\nKaizar is probably the least I'm interested in, I wasn't a huge fan of his role in genesis, he was a bit mutable and so easyly swept by women.
