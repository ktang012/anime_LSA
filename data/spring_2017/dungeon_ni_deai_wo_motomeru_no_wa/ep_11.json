The novels had a much stronger focus on the theme of 'becoming a hero', you get a real sense of growth and adventuring. \n\nNot to mention, the first 3 volumes were more or less an intro, ending with Bell finally getting to level 2 and forming his group. Volume 4 was a sort of interlude that fleshed out the characters, which was unfortunately rushed through in the anime. Volume 5 is where things really start to get interesting. For reminder, volume 5's main event was the fight against the Goliath, at the end of the first season of anime. From Volume 5 on, things just get better and better. Even with Bell's growth, they are still considered weak compared to other well established factions, they are underdogs that you can't help but to cheer for. The world lore/setting is also incredible, you can find a bunch of easter eggs regarding to various mythologies and etc. \n\nIf you still need extra convincing to get into the LNs, here is a minor spoiler that should pique your interest\n\n[DanMachi LN Spoiler](/s \"there will be a very meaningful rematch between Bell and the Minotaur\")"

We liked to call Bell OP AF but that's harder to say now considering Alf just cleaned house without much trouble and we didn't even include the likes of Bete, Tiona, Tione, and Aiz kicking butt with relative ease as well. \n\nI loved the last scene; it brings in another angle and ties itself to the main story and I hope people will think of Bell a little more than just *that OP MC with a harem* after this show as we move parallel with the main story. \n\nAs someone who is reading the manga adaptation I'm really eager to see how far they'll go!

Later someone evil catches a minotaur and trains it to be really strong and Bell defeats it, but doesn't realise why it's so strong. Bell is joined by a little midget thief and a blacksmith guy and with the loki familia they venture far into the dungeon where the dungeon goes all weird and they're attacked by some boss thing, probably because Hestia and another god stepped into the dungeon which is a big no-no. \")\n\nSince this is all from Aiz's perspective, we might miss a few references to the original series, but I don't think a solid memory of it is required."

Of course I am going to be downvote with so much fans behind this series. Look at the posts. Comments like \"It's awesome, I'm hyped\" are getting upvoted to the roof but posts against the show, with reasons or otherwise, are getting downvoted because of the fanboys. This isn't the first show like this. Check any series with 500+ likes. The bottom comments all say that the episode was bad. Every time. It's like fanboys think that with enough negative karma they can make the flaws go away. It's like \"downvote them to the the end of the page so nobody notices the flaws in the show I like\". That's what I'm saying from the very beginning. Posts that are pro series get upvoted and those against are downvoted. With valid reasons or otherwise. And I am dead right."

It is only about the opinions. \n\nAlso, if something is bad, even if most of the community was hyped, you will see comments about how bad it was. The same goes in the other direction: Shows like Frame Arms Girl, which wasn't hyped at all, gets rather positive comments because it was way better than expected.\n\nOf course, most of the people you find in these discussions are fans, but that is because they are fans, they start to watch the show. So their expectations are aligned with what the show can deliver.\n\nBut if you had any good explanation, why you dislike this or any other episode, then write it down. If I come across and see it, I'll upvote you, if I can understand your reasoning. But for now, I have nothing from you.\n\nIn the LWA discussions the voices grow louder that they want more than a CGDCT show, they were never the top comment, but that is because most of the viewer were happy with what the show delivered.\n\n> Posts that are pro series get upvoted and those against are downvoted. \n\n> This isn't the first show like this. Check any series with 500+ likes. The bottom comments all say that the episode was bad.\n\n[Clockwork planet discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/63v4xx/spoilers_clockwork_planet_episode_1_discussion/) - it includes spoilers of course.\n\nUse \"sort after top\":\n\n- first comment is negative with 255 upvotes, the thread has 422 upvotes with 490 participants. I hope this is enough.\n\n- second one is a joke with negative emphasis\n\n-  third is a joke\n\n- fourth is negative\n\n- the fifth is negative\n\nAs you can see, the series was quite hyped, co-author is the NGNL guy, the LN is great, the manga also (I think). Key visual looked great, the PV were ... the first time when some negative voices were raised.\n\nAfter one episode, most of the viewer disliked it. The second discussion [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/657jrp/spoilers_clockwork_planet_episode_2_discussion/?sort=top) is already more positive, but that is understandable, people who disliked the first episode strongly, stopped watching it. But here is also the second and third and fourth comment more negative. \n\nAs you can see, they didn't need any reasoning for that, because everyone saw what happened. \n\nIn this discussion, the audience couldn't see any problems, so you have to explain to them, why the episode should be bad, if they couldn't find the flaws, which you saw.\n\nI hope the Clockwork planet example is enough for you, you can also go to the Sakurada reset discussion which were also quite negative.
