   "text": "So there's a narrative structure here; some stories that act out deconstruction narratives would do something like that (Superman punching a villain through a building that ends up killing people through the damage caused...); but most stories instead conveniently handwave that away because it complicates the narrative that is meant to be a conflict between characters.\n\nHere, Hatori is on a certain path, she doesn't want to be a witch, because few people want to be evil; they just end up being evil as a result of a series of bad choices. Hatori in our case, without a strong moral compass (which Ayumu isn't, she's more likely a canary) has been making bad choice after bad choice as a result of her powers.\n\nHatori hasn't killed anyone yet because the narrative wants to present that as her Rubicon moments, the moment she does something she can't take back and becomes a \"Witch\" that has to be put down/becomes a villain or ends up having to seek recompense and redemption.\n\nThough my guess is Ayumu serves that role; the \"line that can't be crossed\" is probably Hatori uses her jedi mind trick powers on Ayumu in a moment of anger or frustration."

Zombify the whole world as you jump from place to place? \n\n\nPersonally I like that about her character, it's simple childish escapism. She just has the means to take it much further than others.

Not sure what Shizuku's stemmed from, maybe a desire to be able to create or do lots of things at once, due to overwork? \n\nWith Sana, maybe she had a empty early childhood and wanted to create a magical world to live in, though since she may be the source of the magic, different rules may apply. Also I'm not sure about the artistic kid, maybe a desire fix something that was broken."
