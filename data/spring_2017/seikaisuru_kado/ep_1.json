Then comes Hanamori, stays in that place with Yukika and raises her while Shindou and Saraka come back to the normal timeline. Only a year has passed at this point in that isolated space, which is probably Saraka's home, where she is shown at the end of the episode. While Shindou and Saraka were out in this timeline no time at all has passed. They got out and confronted zaShunina, while Hanamori and Yukika were still  in the isolated place for ~15 years (of it's own timeline). Shindou dies, Hanamori and Yukika come out (15 years older). Yukika shows zaShunina the video Shindou has recorded earlier. You can see that Shindou and Saraka haven't *visibly* grew older as they have only been there for a year, while Yukika is a 15 year old girl now and Hanamori looks like he is in his late 40s."

It's like they had all these cool ideas that they wanted to explore, but all they knew was anime and nothing else.

They certainly had the cool ideas to explore, but at the same time it's no surprise that they couldn't keep with the quality of the first episodes. Imagining the first reactions that ZaShunina's arrival would create is not that hard, but imagining believable ramifications on the long term is a whole other beast. It's like writing a 200 words paragraph vs a 30 pages research paper. To make things worse, we can't really know if the writer(s) were genuinely unable to come up with some thing better or if the episode 8 shift was due to other circumstances. We know that writing a book and writing an anime put different constraints on the authors. It's hard to take risks when every ingenious idea you come up with can be scraped by a board of investors. "

No. Shindo literally looks up Metal Plate Processing Technology on Google (Setten in this case) and takes a printout to the professor (and then to the company). Or are you trying to tell me that a negotiator who had nothing to do with metal plating, came up with a new generation of technology over one night of internet research.\n\nMoreover, that \"higher dimensional\" baby doesn't make the least bit of sense. While a human-anisotropic hybrid does mean it that *could* be better than an anisotropic being, it doesn't mean that it will exist in a higher dimension (not in a physical sense). You are fusing abilities here not dimensions. Just like a baby between two 3d humans doesn't end up existing in 6 dimensions, regardless of whether or not it is more capable than it's parents.\n\nI do get your point though, it's just that it doesn't relate as profoundly to the pilot and the finale as you've mentioned. And if you do consider the \"create new generation\" part (like the half saiyan baby, or the fusion part), doesn't it mean you gave up and handed it over to your children, in hopes that they will be better than you and be able to figure it out?\n\nSo, the right answer is to essentially give up and postpone the problem to the future until someone better comes along and takes care of it for you. Aren't humans already experts at that?"

Because humans have information on something he doesn't. And when a lone person who's only driving force is consuming information stumbles upon humanity, what does he do ? He tries to elevate them to his level to get that info.\n\nIt's like teaching an ape sign language.

   "text": "Ok so I definitely did not see this coming.\n\nI'm not sure how to feel about this, there was a lot I liked in fact, it definitely exceeded my expectations from last episode somewhat, but some of the stuff here was just unbelievable. \n\nOk so ZaShunia has truly lost it at this point, as I thought, his nature colliding with his humanity has left him confused and contradictory, really it's sad that he has essentially devolved into a blithering lunatic, his blunt logical mindset, became replaced with a warm and charming curiosity, only to be followed up by an inevitable mental collapse, honestly, that's enough for me to be satisfied with his character, he wasn't quite a villain, he was an antagonist, but I feel like there was still some merit to what he said, though little considering how far gone he was by the end of all of this. Plus his facial expressions were incredible, the fact that they were so over the top seemed to fit with how his character had changed, they almost seemed childish and petulant, very fitting and also really well animated, really making use of CG's advantages. \n\nSpeaking of CG, this show looked breathtaking I must say, the CG was off putting at first, but the amount of confidence the animators had in it's unique attributes shows, a lot of the stuff shown like Kado's transformations would be difficult to pull off with traditional animation. \n\nShindo dies then, also quite sad, though not unexpected, I honestly didn't expect him to walk away from this unscathed, and even if he did, he may have been in for it, for colluding with ZaShunia or something. I'm glad they didn't 'nihon sonzai' him back to life, I feel him coming back to life would've been pushing the reset button a bit too much, considering how everything just goes back to square one at the end. (Well not entirely)\n\nBut his backup plan if he failed is just ridiculous. In an isolated space, he has Hanamori raise his daughter in an isolated space for 16 years, poor Hanamori I can't believe he agreed to this. Dude lost 16 years of his life raising someone else's daughter. Though the girl's existence is interesting, the idea of a unity between the two beings, is certainly more 'equality' based than ZaShunia's belief that they are lower beings. Though still a novelty in my eyes, and the romance undeveloped, the ideas on display are a testament to just how incredible humanity is, and so thematically meaningful, and her power is also justified, considering she's a unity of Shindo, who is 'greater than one' and a Anisoptropic being. \n\nI'm glad the issue with the clones is addressed, though genetically identical, they lack that certain quality, information that cannot be replicated with an Anisoptropic way of thinking, something that goes beyond their understanding, which ties into the idea that humanity is something else, something unobtainable by normal parameters, their illogical existence makes a logical replacement a paradox, really fascinating discussion taking place. I suggested last week it was Free Will, ZaShunia possessed the same thing I'd wager, he was a slave to his ideas but was capable of thinking for himself once he became more human. Though beyond my interpretation it could really be anything, the show is intentionally vague to allow these kinds of discussions to take place anyway. \n\nNow the epilogue is the most contentious part of this but I actually really liked the speech by the PM. Essentially, like I said we're back to square one, all the gifts no longer work and humanity is left with but the knowledge that the Anisotropic exists. This gives us our next big goal, we've expanded our planet, we've gone beyond our planet, now let's go beyond the universe, to the new dimension, not with trinkets and gifts, but with knowledge, the knowledge that something greater is out there, that is the perfect resolution between the ideological differences between Tsukai and Yahui, humanity will reach the Anisotropic, but at our pace, on our terms. We are great enough and limitless enough that we will surely reach it, then ZaShunia wherever he is will have his wish, he just needs to be a bit more patient. We always look onward, looking for more and break our boundaries, as Zashunia said we are beyond 1, thus we are limitless. Again, really interesting stuff being discussed here. \n\nThe concept of the right answer is also closed here, the right answer is what we make of it, not we as in humanity, but we as in me, as in anyone, us as individuals, our right answer is the one we own, it's not the most unique way to close this concept but done in the frame of a question to answer, gives it a sense of accomplishment, of a goal we have to reach, for the reporters their answer is the truth, for the scientist, her answer is reaching the anisotropic, ZaShunia's answer was to bring humanity to the Anisotropic and Shindo's was to negotiate with ZaShunia. The idea is of course that there is no right answer, at least not categorically, ZaShunia posturing about the right answer was just him pushing his ideals on us, his existence as a higher being gave him warrant to believe in his narrow minded vision, when in reality humanities' brilliance is that we all have our own conclusions to come to, and we won't let outside influence change that. \n\nIt also fits into the daughter's line. 'We are all going somewhere.' Where? Who knows? In terms of the right answer I suppose it's where we choose to go, the girl isn't the inevitable conclusion of humanity, she isn't fully anisotropic after all, she's something greater, so how much further can we go from there? Could we go beyond the anisotropic? Are there higher beings, we've already proved we can surpass them, so how much further can we go, and where will it take us? How will it meld with our answers? Will seeking the truth collide with the Ansiotropic to create an ultimate truth? What will Science accomplish with the Anisotropic? Ultimately, again the answer is that the sky's the limit, the possibilities are truly endless, and for ZaShunia to think the end is the Anisotropic is foolish, we are much greater than that.\n\nI could go on but in terms of just philosophical density, this show knocks it out of the park, but from a narrative standpoint, it is a bit wishy washy. Mainly just the twists that came at the end, I felt like Kaguya Sama finally got an anime for a second, Shindo was like 'I've got him'! But ZaShunia was like 'Ha! I planned this all along!', but then Shindo was like 'You activated my trap card!' \nNot to say the twists weren't entertaining or justified, they didn't COMPLETELY come out of nowhere, but it just seemed a bit farcical, like they were trying to outdo each other to be the most ridiculous. \n\nAgain the fact that this had to end with a climatic showdown was disheartening, despite the ideas that are borne from this ending, I had hoped the show would've kept the ideas of compromise and negotiation, but upon thinking about the idea that the right answer is what we decide, then to go with that decision would've countered the themes, we would've just ended on Shindo's answer not a Tabula Rosa, which is in my opinion a superior idea. \n\nOverall, really interesting show and one I hope will be a topic of discussion for some time, in floundered near the end, but I feel like it was all for a good cause. I can't decide on a score just yet, it would've been a 9 had it done what I thought it would've but honestly it felt like the show had greater aspirations than I had for it. I'll have to rewatch it before I decide on it's final score."

   "text": "[](#gendo-pls)\n\nThat's the right answer. Make more babies Japan. Kado was an undercover campaign all along.    \nAll according to keikaku.\n\n***\n\n>zaShunina : Shindo, come to the anisotropic with me.    \nShindo : I can't go the anisotropic.    \nzaShunina : Why?\n\nOh NOW you're asking him that! Where was that anisotropic pea brain of yours when he basically said the same thing back in episode 9?\n\n> *draws out the anisotropic blade*\n\nThere it is. Now that's more like it, ma boy! I feel like how Endeavor did when Shoto used his left side against Midoriya (wish that was a comment face). \n\n***\n\nSo pathetic. As pathetic as the sight of zaShunina trying to lift himself up with his disconnected arms.    \nThough I am glad that it god so bad, to the point, that I was laughing at every one of their dialogues. It would have been much worse, if there was even a single remaining shred of the things the show did initially. Then it would have been frustrating and painful.\n\nThe dialogue between zaShunina and Shindo about *the greatness of humanity*, was so stupid.\n\n> But humanity, a singularity, created more information than the universe's processing power should allow.\n\nOh yeah, sure, memes can break the universe.    \nSeriously, that statement is so vague, it does not make much logical sense, given, that you look up what [*information*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information#cite_note-1), [*process*](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/process) and [*singularity*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singularity) mean.\n\nYou might say, he means singularity, in a way, where, we humans, keep creating more and more information as we evolve (similar to the concept of [technological singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity), except, with information instead of *intelligence*). True, and it makes sense. But what do you mean \"more information than the universe's processing power should allow\"?    \nIf someone got that, please explain (maybe it's a translation issue).\n\nAnyways, on to zaShunina's theory about what makes humanity unique.\n\n> *zaShunina creates a clone of Shindo and himself and goes on to explain how it isn't actually the real thing*    \nzaShunina : I thought to myself that this must be the nature of the singularity. The power to assign different values to the exact same thing. The power to give a thing that is only \"one\" information amounting to more than one. That is the unprecedented power humanity has created.\n\nJust what in the bloody hell were you reading in your free time zaS? Ecchi light novels?    \nIf you were sooo interested in researching humans, then you would have definitely come across a little concept known as [*Consciousness*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness). It is a particularly interesting feature of human beings. It's an ability that enables us to filter out reality in two parts - the inside and the outside, where the inside is the *I* and the outside is the *surrounding*. It's the ability to separate a process, an event, into an experience and an *experienc-er* (thoughts and a thinker, actions and a doer, etc).\n\nIt is the only reason you can tell that an identical *physical* copy of you, isn't you. Because when you *observe* it, your consciousness filters it to the outside part, because you can *see* it, and most of the time, that what you see (or experience), isn't usually *you*.    \nSo, It's not that you can't tell that the clone isn't you, but that you *know* it isn't you. Because you can feel it, and if it truly was you, then you wouldn't be able to. It is like how you can't tell the taste of your tongue or the smell of your nose or the sound of your ears. (it is quite difficult to put this into words, so I'm sorry if it doesn't make sense).\n\nTo conclude, it isn't the power to assign two values, it is the *the ability to assign, or to separate things* that makes us *special*. Because as long as you can make a distinction between things, you can assign them as many values as you want (or did I misinterpret something in zaShunina's dialogue?) So, the \"unprecedented power\" we have is our consciousness (or ego). zaShunina said it himself,\n\n> It's source is *you* and *me*. It comes from within us.\n\nBut wait. Hold on. Doesn't zaShunina posses that already? He was able to tell apart his clone. And from what we've seen, he has always possesses a sense of self, right from his first appearance. So, how are humans special again?\n\n***\n\nThen there's that daughter.\n\n[](#wallbang)\n\nJust how the fuck do you think baby making works? You're telling me Shindo's spiral sperms pierced the dimensional barrier and got into Saraka's heavenly anisotropic womb to create a singularity baby?    \nWell, Fuck me sideways!\n\n> I am a higher-dimensional being than you.\n\nThat's not how dimensions work. Who taught you that stuff? See, the anisotropic already *encompasses* the three dimensions here, so, your only options of existing were from 1 to 40, not above 40. Look at it this way, take a solid 3d cube, and add a 2d plane at one end. The result is still in 3 dimensions not 5, not 4. You're fusing things that *exist in different dimensions* not fusing dimensions themselves.    \nLooks like Hanamori brought her up on Shonen jump and Cheetos.\n\n***\n\nSeriously man,\n\n[](#kyonfacepalm)\n\nwhat a stupid way to end such a magnificent series. Why put so much effort into building up a play when your final acts looks like this.    \nOh Toei.\n\nEdit : Typos."

You are.    \nYou need to exist first, in a higher dimension, to mold that 2d paper into a 3d cube (or 3d to 4d and so on). Because to mold that piece of flat paper into a cube you will need to move your hands in the third dimension (which in your example are behind and top). If you are confined to 2 dimensions - of say length and breadth, i.e., length and breadth is all you can move in, then you can't move the paper *up and down* because, for you, up and down do not exist. The paper can't move on it's own into the 3rd dimension unless an external, higher dimensional force compels it to (which, in this case, is you).\n\nYou can try it for yourself. Take a sheet of paper. Lay it flat on the table. Place you hands on the table with your palms facing down. Now, without lifting your hands off the table, try making a cube from that sheet. You'll realise that you can't do it.    \nThe most that can happen is that you press the sheet from both sides and it plops up. But that's because of the tension inside the paper, a force that acts in 3 dimensions, because the paper itself isn't a 2d object, it's 3D.\n\nSo when Saraka, who is an anisotropic being of 40 dimensions (3 + 37 as zaS said), and Shindo, who is a human of 3 dimensions, have a baby, it does not become a 40+ dimensional being. There is no outside force that is beyond 40 dimensions which is in action here. Both the participants here are confined to 40 dimensions, so any action they take can't force an object to go beyond it, because any action they *can* take is confined to 40 dimensions (just like how your hands were confined to 2 dimensions on the table top)."

This isn't even just a cringy forced gay character, it's some literal alien gay kid throwing a tantrum over his crush who is hetero having straight sex with a GIRL and making babies.\n\nI sincerely believe this was written by a college fan-girl. No, seriously. Kado is a gay fanfic. A \"lemon\" or whatever they call it. It's like how 50 shades of gray is a fanfic that got turned into a book somehow. Kado is a fanfic that go turned into an anime.\n\nI can't call that final and ultimate twist a literal ass-pull for pretty good reasons, but, I mean, come on. The thing that was introduced to show off ZaChina's power and god-like-esque being used against him. It's retarded, because it's only used that way!\n\nThe anime put itself in such a situation they could have done anything and it would turn to shit. Instead of chosing to do less they just tried to do more shit instead.\n\nThink of it: Wam, Sansa, somthing-haim. Three epically powerful devices that caused so much controversy in the anime and were used by humanity to... do pretty much nothing. We didn't even get to see humans using this crap for ANYTHING at all. They were just handed the stuff, and they were like \"oh, thx,\" and then they did nothing with it for 12 fucking episode and then, RIDICULOUSLY, all those things just stop working. Like fucking magic. What the fucking fuck, Kado? ALL THAT RETARDED BULLCRAP ABOUT NOT SLEEPING BECAUSE OF SOME VOODOO WACKY WACKY ANISOTROPIC WITCHCRAFT AND THAT IS NOT EVEN RELEVANT AT ALL?!?!?!?!? AT FUCKING ALLL!??!?!?!?!? AT LEAST WAM GOT USED FOR SOMETHING.\n\nIn all seriousness, I'm actually pretty amazed with this anime. I'm amazed by how fucking disappointing it is. I'm not american but I suspect this is what it felt like to vote for trump as a liberal and watch his weekly episodes for 3 months. Shit's unbelievably bad. It's not just naturally bad, it's forcibly bad. It's like someone deliberately screwed this up. While good anime you in each episode be like \"Oh, yeah, fuck yeah, GOOD STUFF AGAIN\" in this anime it's \"oh, shit, fuck no, NOTTO DIS SHITTO AGEN!?!?!\" It just got worse and worse and worse. By the end I wasn't even expecting it to redeem itself, I was just staring at the screen with this nauseated expression in my face like I had been sea-sick of sailing on a ship that kept rocking over a sea of crap and I was waiting not for anything good to happen but wonder how the fucking hell would it be able to become even worse than it already was.\n\nAnd the right answer was: time-warping alien babies.\n\nI can't believe I'm rating something below captain earth. 1/10. Worst anime I've ever finished."

It's a device that lets anyone enter the anostropic of their own accord. We have seen humanity struggle to accept the devices and resist them but ultimatly accept them and gain a understanding of the wham. \n\nThat's what the readers/watched were interested in. The alien scify and the realisitic political reactions humanity had. Lets continue that idea, lets go full boom into the weird more dimensional universe.\n\nMaybe humanity splits off, some go in while some stay. Ultimatly the main character and his random new love life girl friend decide to stay, for the future of humanity in their purest views. \n\nSo they stay and we get the same ending. God leaves, all his devices stop working, the humanity that stayed gets to progress science on there own two feet while a bunch of humans becomes something else, all on their own accord. \n\nThe alien god stays like an alien god, hell maybe he makes a clone of the main character and takes him with him, god seems to not care about the difference and still stays alien ish tot us. The main character stays and the the clone winks at the main character before going off.\n\nI've just made this up on the spot and I think more poeple would be happy with a ending like this.,"

After all, the basis of negotiation is to find common ground between an argument (thesis) and a counter argument (antithesis). This is often called a synthesis, that creates something new by taking something from both statements. This is what Shindo exemplifies in the epilogue by creating the supermetal with the factory workers. In this case, Shindo and Saraka's child was the literal synthesis of the Anistropic and the humanity.\n\nAlso, [Sayaka's implied pregnancy in the OP.](http://imgur.com/fXQ6tXe) Mother's Basement, You're welcome."

I could go on for a while about all the terribly parts of this episode, but I'll leave it at this. Knowing this is what those great first episode led up to ruins it all. One of the worst conclusions of Anime I've ever seen.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nKado started out strong and was strong for a good part of the series, but quickly declined in one of the biggest quality drops I have ever seen in a show. The final few episodes were nothing short of laughably bad and knowing it all led up to that completely ruins the experience for the first few episodes in hindsight. The good part can't possibly make up for an ending like this, and I can't find myself pushing myself to give this any higher than a **Mid 4**. Sure, part of it was great, but those parts were great because of the mystery and intriguing parts of ZaShuina.

I mean, the dude's basically gay for Shindou. \n\nAnyway, was this episode written by a different guy from the rest of the series? It feels almost like a completely different show. I know they were hinting at zaShunina slowly growing emotions during his time on Earth, but to have him suddenly screaming and crying about everything seems like we're skipping a step. Or several.   \nAnd then to have a superpowered fist fight as the big climax, what were they thinking? This is a sci-fi series that drew people in based on its thought-provoking concepts. Having a physical fight solve the problem seems like someone wildly missed the point of their own show.  \nThe whole Yukika thing was kinda cool, but seeing her wreck zaShunina like that felt ... unnecessary. He was a morally neutral character who had motives that would have had an overall negative impact on humanity. So why are they treating him like some paragon of evil who deserves no mercy? It's stupid.   \nAnd was Shindou really dead? I mean really? If it was something he planned all along, why is he dead? You have a daughter who literally controls space and time, along with a couple dozen other dimensions humans can't even comprehend. Fixing a hole in your chest should be that hard!   \nAnd of course humanity loses all the things they got from the anisotropic. Because fuck lasting consequences. You do realise this basically means that nothing that happened in the show really mattered in the big picture, right? \n\nSo yeah, this was kind of a shitty ending. But I don't actually think that it detracted from the show on the whole. The ideas it brought up earlier are still intriguing, and it's still possible to enjoy most f the episodes. just not this one."

I only watched Unicorn because I was impressed by Iron Blooded Orphans and decided to give Sunrise a second look and it was streaming on CR. Any recommends for Gundam are appreciated, though this comment thread is getting a bit off topic for Kado. It wasn't a complete waste, but I wasn't really watching it week to week. I only got to the penultimate episode in a binge session the night before the finale aired. Given that I had binged Unicorn just last week and I thought it had done a better job with the subject matter I thought I'd mention it.

From my interpretation, anisotropic beings, or at least ones like zaShunina, don't experience emotions on a human level. Obtaining a body, a language, then knowledge was definitely the gamechanger for zaShunina. The more he read, the more he learnt, of the physical and non-physical. Particularly emotions. He became more human and began feeling attachment, or learnt what attachment felt like. Obviously, he hadn't gained experience, so his behaviour or  'yandere-ness' was much like a child's. Premature and curious. The underdevelopment in controlling his impulses led him to do a number of things and act in all sorts of way. His expression were an obvious reflection of that. I wouldn't be surprised if what zaShunina felt was love, whether on a familial level or a romantic - we don't know that and zaShunina may not have been able to successfully identify it.\n\nAll that aside, Shindo was there for most, if not all, of zaShunina's 'growth' as a human. It wouldn't be strange if zaShunina saw Shindo as someone like a parent, or object of interest or infatuation. "

Similarly, I think Shindo didn't completely die, yes, his physical body is indeed kaput, but Yukika brought him (or his essence, whatever) along with her to the higher dimension to join with zaShunina there.\n\n3. In the end, the sound effect heard at Saraka's apartment seems to suggests Saraka also \"ascended\" into the higher dimension to be with her family.\n\nPS At least we know that them being naked a while ago wasn't completely for nothing.

After Zashunina supposedly killed Shindo, I actually hoped it would subvert the cliches and let the MC lose for once, and have Zashunina give us the 'right' answer or whatever. But of course that doesn't happen ever, and then a car rolled up from out of nowhere. It was kinda hilarious though, and definitely unexpected, so I'll give them that. \nSo, did Shindo actually die in the end? Maybe. But at least he got to bang a god before that, and they gave birth to a daughter who's a super god, who can probably bring him back to life easily, so that's great. One helluva plan Shindo. \n\nFor what it's worth, the show had really good animation throughout, and definitely one of the best CG I've seen. Music was pretty good too. Great sci fi potential in the beginning, lost its way in the middle, and the last episode was a comedy. 6/10"

Guess what, it's not, and I ended up setting my expectations too high. OK I admit I'm kinda mad now so I won't write in length, but seriously, I can't believe how the show just introduced a MarySue in the last ep to solve all conflicts in the climax using pretty much brute force. I also hate how the show still tried to be all \"philosophical\" in the end by repeating bullshit lines like \"what's beyond information\" and \"we're all on our ways\"; some other major bullshit that the plot of the show hinges on are 1) the mechanism or plausibility of producing a human-anisotropic offspring using only biological, human reproduction methods, and 2) how Yaha-K turns into a yandere and dies in the end because apparently a 16-yo girl has more understanding of the ansiotropic than him and just the understanding alone grants her omnipotence. Sorry, I just don't buy it, more understanding of the world doesn't grant you magic mind power that allows you to directly influcence objective reality; by this logic Einstein would be able to do crazy shit with light and pretty much the whole space-time continuum. Bullshit aside, I also love how Saraka's plot-tool kid reverted all the changes the ansiotropic induced, now I just feel like I wasted 6 hours watching an event that turns out to be utterly pointless in the end. \nTo sum up, this show was a disappointment to me, felt like mayogia all over again, but I'll continue to hope that there'll be more shows with ambitious opening and build up, but do not disappoint when they end, in the future.

Since we the viewer get to see all of their plan on screen, to suddenly throw in these extra details that were NEVER mentioned to us (or even hinted at, frankly) I was confused.\n\nI know that Shindo asked Hanamori a favor, but I wish I had seen a scene between Shindo and fem-zaShunina implying they had sexual relations which would've filled the gap in knowledge for me. A kiss on a park bench isn't exactly the same xD"

All of the inventions to advance humanity had very little thought to them, unlimited energy is useless without the infrastructure it was pretty much glorified batteries. Humanity doesn't lack energy, it lacks the ability to supply energy easily.\n\nMaking sleep unnecessary just speaks what every over worked japanese employee's dream would be, it's not really a necessary thing advance humanity.\n\nAbility to control gravity, it's a bit more interesting power than the first 2, but again it's unnecessary for humanity to advance. The inventions aren't really thought compelling, and unless the explanation from Za Shunia is \"Lets just give them some little trinkets so I can use my ultimate plan of bringing them over to my universe\" then those are lame gifts to give. \n\nBetter powers would be ability to see what we can't see currently, perhaps that's other dimensions or perhaps that's ability to see quarks. Ability to process things faster with our brain or at least better control of how to think, and ability to control the molecules around us. Similar results much more fascinating abilities. It also makes more sense when trying to advance humanity closer to gods.\n\nOther stuff was bad too, but the basic concept was interesting it was just executed horribly, an actual science fiction political show would have been nice."

He just brought the magical interdimensional child over to wreck ZaShunina's shit, right? What was that about raising her for 16 years? Wasn't Shindo alive in this hypothetical alternate world line? And even if he wasn't, Saraka definitely was.\n\nOr wait, did they make a baby *before* confronting crazy yandere alien? Was it just a 9 months time skip and not a whole alternate universe shebang? I don't get it. It's pretty hilarious that I first heard of this show because someone said it had \"Fire Emblem CG\". Well.

This could have been so good, but it just turned mediocre. But if this left a bad taste in your mouth at least the best thing you can take away from this is that at least we can have decent looking shows with 95% cgi, also, alien boi's reaction to being shown the video of the baby was very well done, expressions were conveyed very well. thanks for the commentary guys, good luck next time."
