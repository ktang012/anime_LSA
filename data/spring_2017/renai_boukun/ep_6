All it took was Seiji's genuine compliment about her being kind and that made her curious about him and that curiosity eventually turned into love. It wasn't as grand as I was expecting, it simple and sweet. I like it! We even got to see what [Blue](http://i.imgur.com/FY1Sgka.png) looks like without being possessed by Coraly. \n\nAlso at this point I'm pretty sure Akane's last name is actually Zoldyck. I seriously hope their family's estate is located in the middle of a forest and has a giant dog guarding their compound.\n\n[](#rinkek)"
