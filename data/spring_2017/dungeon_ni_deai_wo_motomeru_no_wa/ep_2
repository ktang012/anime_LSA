   "text": "Good episode. Glad to see Bell's fight again, even abbreviated.\n\nI gotta say though, I'm very disappointed to see they once again skipped over an important point about Bell's status (basically, status = character stats: STR, AGI, etc - with ranks running from 'I' at lowest, to 'S' at greatest - plus special abilities. FYI, stats reset from their highest ranks, back to 'I', the lowest, whenever an adventurer levels up, then they repeat the process of raising them til next level-up.):\n\n[DanMachi Light Novel spoilers](/s \"In the LNs, Bete sees Bell's back uncovered and wants to know his status, Ais reads it out loud to everyone as 'All S' (in the anime, Riveria is the one that reads it aloud), which surprised everyone (the DanMachi S1 anime showed this much at least), but only Ais and Riveria could actually read the status and saw that one attribute of his status had an unheard of SS rank, which they kept to themselves. This should have been a very big deal. At the very least this episode should have shown their surprise, but they skipped right over even the 'All S' announcement itself. This scene should be important because Bell's fight was supposedly a big motivator to everyone who saw it, and in the LNs Riveria even briefly laughed out loud, with (I believe) the intended implication being 'as if everything she thought she knew was turned upside down', or something along those lines. In other words it was quite a shock to her. Plus, Ais should definitely have some inner thoughts on the subject at the very least, but we've gotten nothing about that so far, in either the DanMachi LNs, anime, or Oratoria anime. Hopefully the Oratoria LNs and/or manga will pick up that slack when they get released/translated.\")\n\nEDIT: Oh yeah, I just remembered a bit of info from a later LN volume: [LN Spoilers again] (/s \"Bell's fight scene is where Finn notices Lili for the first time I believe, and gets interested in her. BTW, it was her 'courage' in that situation, doing everything she could to get someone to save Bell, instead of running away to save herself, that caught his eye. So that's something else they didn't cover here. Though to be fair, the most they should have shown, if anything at all, would be an 'interested glance in her direction', since he never said anything to her at the time, only announcing his interest later to her directly (in a DanMachi volume 8 short story, fyi). So I can't really complain *much*, but it would've been nice to see anyway.\")\n\nEDIT 2: FYI, Bell's fight in the LNs (main series, not Oratoria) can be found [LN timeline spoilers:](/s \"in volume 3, chapters 4 (later half) and 5 (which begins with Loki familia beginning their expedition and quickly running across Bell's fight for the finale).\")\n\nEDIT 3: corrections and additional info."

On retrospect I wish it would've went on longer... but I guess the pacing of the storytelling wouldn't have been the same.  But still =D\n\nI'm enjoying the 2nd season with the different perspective as well.  I really dig the style of showing the same timeline from another PoV.  The minor gripe I have about it is it focused alot on Lefiya, which is fine.. But it didn't quite have the pull of a semi MC that she should've had to make this season great.  The introduction of the other elf love interest made it much better for the awkward feeling that the whole season would revolve solely on her shy love interest with Ais. \n\nWish they could've gone way in detail on Ais's inner thoughts on her battle with the floor boss and the chick tamer.. but then again.. the pacing within 12 episodes would've been screwed up and doubt they could've fit in everything... maybe.\n\nFor what it's worth it kept my interest and still is.
