   "text": "I guess it was good, but his whole rant right before that about how magic could only be used to kill was incredibly laughable to me. Like, really? Healing any wounds, curing any sickness,  creating massive amounts of energy, all from nothing but words, not a single material required, has no application other than killing? Infinite energy, no sickness, no famine, all that is worthless to pursue? And that's just from the simple spells we have seen in 2 episodes. I'm assuming there will be spells that create matter from nothing, maybe even life. \nMy problem with this anime is that it has too many moment like that that break from the normal tone so that it can fit magical girl tropes, have an edgy MC, and get that fanservice in. Ridiculous \"uniforms\", the changing scene from last ep., and now this fucking rape scene that they tried to play off as a joke. Honestly if it fixes those a little I'll stay, otherwise I'm not gonna put myself through it past ep. 3."

   "text": "they pretty much revealed the mc's entire backstory / relation with magic in this episode. loved magic as a child. ex-military. very powerful / skilled, since i'm assuming he's the one that saved the girl in the past. based on his attitude (pre-motivation to start doing things seriously), and reluctance to reveal more of his past beyond the past year of freeloading, you can assume that something happened to change him.\n\nwith the military thing, that relates with how things are in the US. if you work in a research lab that is funded by military, it doesn't matter what you do, the first question they ask will be how can we use this to kill people, or support our people that are killing people? after enough time, it'd be reasonable that he'd become jaded, viewing magic as a tool for killing. then, assuming some event where either he was ordered to kill a lot of people or he witnessed a lot of people get killed by magic, he quits the military and goes to bum around for a year.\n\nwhen he sees the girl trying to perform the magic circle and helps her out, it reminds him of the love and awe he had for magic as a child, which leads to him gaining some motivation to actually teach.\n\nfor the uniforms, it'd be bland if every anime/manga had standard uniforms. maybe i've just been de-sensitized to it over the years, but i hardly noticed them beyond the first time seeing it and going \"lol, really?\". the rape joke, at least in my head is sort of not part of the main timeline. it's a gag they slipped in for fun, not truely part of the story. this is just my opinion / how i'm approaching it, it doesnt really take away from the show for me unless they start doing it too often."

I like them.\n\nGranted there are few I dont like much like Haruna from Kore was Zombie or Im kinda indifferent towards like Kirino. Most of the time, I like them.

So I guess it will be a mutual thing.\n\nWe get to see a little bit of Glenn's past and from what we know something about it made Glenn hate magic and see that it's only purpose is to kill humans. Whatever that reason is it looks like it's the same reason that turned him into a shut-in NEET these past few years.\n\nCompared to last week this episode is definitely an improvement. Too bad a lot of people probably already dropped this because of that. Sure it had it's cliches but it's not as bad as people think it is."

I would rate it like 6/10 because it was good in the end and presented some well executed ideas. But i really wanted to drop youjo senki after ep 3 or smth.\n\nIn this anime i saw some potential in the first ep so i said to myself that i will wait another week and see if its any good. First episode besides a couple of funny gags wasnt very captivating. It was worth it. Second episode is much better, eplores the magic system and gives characterization and much more development to the cast+ some action. The main character here is actually experienced in terms of fighting so its easier for me to belive in his prowess. He is already a grown up man so having a lot of knowledge about magic (which is really cool to boot) isnt weird. And he isnt totally OP, although he has in his possesion the unique magic of \"fools world\" ( i like when stories reference tarrot but i wonder if they will do something more with it...besides some cool names and references) it isnt totally uncounterable. Due to the magic he cant casts spells himself and needs to train his body, he cant cancel long range magic cuz of the range of the spell. Its powerfull but not totally overpowered( what i hate the most in stories are totally overpowered characters that just roll over anything, especially those characters that are only written for easy wishfulfillment for the viewer meaning self insertion, i hate it...fuck xianxia novels)\n\nedit: i just wonder if they will continue with the tarrots theme and if they will go with the card \"the world\"what will the ability be called ? \"the worlds world\" ?\n\nobviously it rather wouldnt be called like that but just a fun tought"

But I distinctly remember finishing episode 1 of YouJo Senki and felt that it was not going to be like Izetta and that it had done a good job of distinguishing itself. It wasn't a \"I hope it's different this time\" but more of a \"wow.. this IS different...\"\n\n> they were put off by Tanya's art.\n\nI guess aesthetic differences certainly play a role.

You'd think more of them would be psychopaths (who would, of course, *not* experience said crushing guilt). Though I guess in terms of making a character likeable, them being totally heartless is problematic, and once you start giving them some semblance of a heart, you've gotta give them soul-crushing guilt about being an assassin too.... .... ... Whelp, that's that question answered."

It would set the tone more seriously, though. They could have made him arrogant because he's able to trump any opponent's move, scornful of magic because he knows exactly how powerful it is and what it can't achieve, or lazy because he privileges efficiency. They did none of this, in my opinion.\n\nThe first episode is typically reserved for character introduction, and that's what I think they missed by not giving any explicit indication. I have my reasons to not believe it myself, but I wouldn't blame someone for considering Glenn as \"an annoying brat that got some magical motivation to show MC-level OP powers after a completely unrelated dialogue\".\n\n~~Maybe~~ I'm definitely reading too much in this (as evidenced by the length of this answer. Crap), but it is enough to see how many comments are saying that the second episode was much better to conclude that the first episode did things wrong. The most obvious difference (Glenn being a badass) is likely correlated with that."

For instance, the lecture about Shock Bolt made his initial notion about magic sensible. The school and its students approach the spell as something that can be used to attack people. That is why in the textbooks they were taught to shorten the chant. But they didn't actually understand the entirety of the spell. During the lecture, by chanting the spell in different ways, they were able to find different purposes of Shock Bolt. For example, when one line of the chant was erased, the power output plummeted which can be used to power some electric-powered machine without overcharging it. Anyway, it's actually nice to learn the magic in this world. \n\n"

And he went into detail about how he doesn't like girls like the blondie, because she's resilient, and this girl isnt. It makes  you feel as though she's cornered, and he's really going to do this. It's happening. It's very hard to watch. In fact, I myself am somewhat into this fetish that is similar to rape, but without the ill intent, and with consent. Its hard to explain, but basically, I would never act on it, and i am in fact disgusted with those who do, and this scene in particular i had 0% attraction towards. This is rape. It's not fanservice, and it's not some perverted old man who no one's worried about. He's got the malicious intent to break her, and i'm really glad they didn't linger on it more than they did. I really wish they left out the comedy in it, they can put it more light hearted than when she was being touched, but to taunt us, the audience, and say \"here's your savior to stop the situation, and he's going to leave comedically because whoops he's too dumb not to realize that it's not consensual sex, oh well, i guess she's screwed now!\"\n\nAll in all, impressive, repulsive, please dont do it again."

Glenn seems to at least still have some fight left in him as Juggs-sensei was able to get him to work fairly easy (just 1 bolt next to his head and he was motivated).

I absolutely love the fact that she has flaws and she has things she needs to overcome and is something that she has consistent difficulty with.\n\n[One thing I dislike about many LNs] (/s \" is the breakthrough episodes where the character gathers resolves and all of a sudden all past trauma and difficulties become obsolete. \" )\n\nI like Sistine"

Because honestly, it wasn't bad only because it was there to begin with, but the reaction and timing of things afterwards was really awkward and made the scene more horrid. The Magical Punch and his mannerisms would've worked better if the situation wasn't that serious to begin with. But the first episode also had very gratitious fanservice so I can be confident with episode 2 > episode 1.  \nTo the rest of the episode, while I haven't understood half of the explanations he made, the magic system in this world sounds intricate but in a really good way. Glenn isn't a loser anymore and at last it feels like his arrogance is partially justfied and thus far more enjoyable.  \nWe can also expect a good share of story now and if the magic is as craftily made as the plot, it'll be a good surprise after all."

My point was that the cases where everyone trembles in fear doing nothing far outnumber the cases where a coup d'etat happens. Yes, if some people are feeling particularly heroic, they can light the spark and start the revolution. But those people are the outliers. If they were common, dictatorships wouldn't be a problem. \n\nThe guy taking Sisty away is even more reason for the rest of the students to shut up and obey. Because the thug didn't just pick whichever girl he felt was pretty, he picked the one person that kept talking back. So in the student's minds, the logic is \"Sisty resisted, so they punished her. If I don't resist, maybe I wouldn't be punished.\" There's no guarantee that they won't be next, but starting an attack almost certainly guarantees danger. And in the end, they were right: one thug took Sisty, the other thug took Rumia, there are no other thugs and Sisty certainly doesn't look like she just saw her classmates get massacred, so they who did nothing suffered nothing. And of course they were right, because bad guys understand this logic too. Targeting those that resist first is practically Thug 101. If the thugs had started shooting at random students that weren't resisting, THEN the whole class would fight, since there would no longer be any reason to obey.\n\n(I'm not saying that their inaction is right, I'm saying that this is a fairly common occurrence, so it shouldn't be puzzling.)"

He goes against the typical way of thinking for example, something that is not her way to do things, but after he showed that he can more than the typical teacher would show, she shows interest in him. That she blushes every time is not a sign that she felt for him, it is more a sign, that she sees him as a man, who irritates her a lot.

True, probably a large percentage of them either are shut ins because of depression or are depressed because they're shut ins, and in either case, that depression would make it difficult (but not impossible) to find the motivation to do anything. \n\nHowever, a person might become a shut in because they have crippling social anxiety or something instead. Now, I know you might have bought into this farce that people need regular face-to-face interaction with other humans in order to be happy, but that's completely untrue (although possibly a requirement for being mentally stable, but Glenn certainly isn't making any claims in that department).\n\nNow, in this instance of course, Glenn pretty obviously *is* (or at least was until quite recently) depressed, but while depression makes it difficult to muster up motivation, as I noted before, it doesn't make it impossible. Especially if exercising and such was a habit long before he became depressed - it's much easier to maintain a good habit than to start a new one.\n\nAdditionally, as far as I can tell, their world doesn't have internet. Or TV. Or video games. So while you or I might spend our days doing something like that to stave off boredom, Glenn's main options are to read, write, draw, clean, exercise.... Mostly productive things. Sleeping all the time gets really boring after all. So it'd actually be more unrealistic to expect him not to keep up the work. \n\nAlthough, he does seem surprised when he performs a spell and it's weaker than he expected, so he might have been slacking a little bit."

   "text": "> The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.\n\nUgh, that's about as bad as my \"everyone is different\" lulz. \n\n> It's not so farfetch to expect they do it in the same way since writters don't try very hard to change tropes at all.\n\nNo, it's not farfetched in the slightest to be willing to believe that a writer will be lazy given a fair number of them are. But the entire reason we started this was, if I'm remembering correctly, because Glenn's skill level made it obvious he must have been training and not sitting on his butt for the past year, and you believed that that directly conflicted with his previous statement that he was a shut in while I thought the two were perfectly reasonable together. Since the writer has clearly stated that Glenn was a shut in and then shown him doing things that he clearly could not do if he hadn't kept up at least some degree of training, it's not a matter of whether the writer was keeping to a stereotype or not but whether.... I guess whether Glenn was lying about being a shut in for the past year? \n\nHm. Now that I go there, what exactly is being argued here anyway (besides apparently the definition of a shut in, and if we're going to move on to that, we really should define if we're talking about a hikkikomori or a NEET, since both often get translated into shut in in English, but mean different things).\n\n> Glenn resembles to Raul in a lot of ways, both are young adults that stopped doing what they liked and became shut ins for a period of time.\n\nDo we have any reason to believe that Glenn was doing something he liked? I mean, the facts we know right now are a) as a child he thought magic was amazing and wonderful, b) as an adult he killed some evil mages at least once and likely had something to do with the military, and c) now he thinks magic is good for nothing but causing more death. For all we know, he hated everything about his job but felt it was necessary for some reason, and we know absolutely nothing about whatever event prompted him to become a shut in. \n\n> you even admit some of the PTSD soldiers don't go thru physical excercise routines.\n\n...Yes? \n\n> I remember some guy pulling out some whacky theory about Showa Genroku Rakugo back in season 1, some guy shot down his theory and he got tons of upvotes. The whacky theory ended up being reality at the end of season 2.\n\nHeheh, I remember seeing them being so excited in the season 2 discussion thread. Making up theories *is* fun. But my general rule is that if I'm going to try to argue a point, I have to try to a) be logical and reasonable and b) do my best to avoid using my own situation to prove a point, although I don't always manage."
