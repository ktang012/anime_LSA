   "text": "Well, of all the episodes until now, I think this one is the weakest one, which speaks a lot since it is still pretty good, but that moment they used to some sort puts us into Nina's head when she tries to transform was very large, more than it needed to be. Other than that the episode is pretty much solid.\n\nKaisar is a badass with the sword I see, and it is pretty fun to see how he uses his mechanical arm to beat Charioce. That was pretty creative.\n\nI think every character was portrayed pretty well. I liked how thy shadowed Charioce's face when he stood to ask Nina is she was the Red Dragon. It kinda surprised me at first that Kaisar wouldn't say anything like Nina did, but I think that does actually reflects how much more mature he has become.\n\nRita being outside and pretty much not knowing anything is kinda hilarious in itself, but I called this some weeks ago when Rocky appeared for the first time, that they will be put in a situation where only Rocky would be able to save them, and that only because well, he's pretty small and can infiltrate easily, get the keys easily and that way they will escape. I feel though that this prison escape will be bombastic now that Favaro is back :P\n\nNina being put in a cell across Jeanne's is pretty interesting. I wonder what would be their interaction since I didn't think this two would be paired somehow. Of course, like others already said here, the very beginning of the next episode we will have Kaisar yelling FAVAROOOOOOOO!!!! :D... pretty nostalgic eh? and it will be awesome to see again this duo working together.\n\nI hope Azazel finally chills down. I mean, he has been beated up into the ground, so maybe you should think things more. Stop being an ass and use the brain you have instead of the feelings of rage you have. Honestly it is pretty hard to see him being so incompetent.\n\nLooking at the grand picture, I wonder if there is going to be an enemy on the background that everyone can join and fight together. I can kinda get that we are getting all the sides of the story here but I can't picture them, or the show itself, being about all these characters fighting each other. I feel there should be something more, something related to what the angel said to Charioce at the beginning of episode 1, that the power he was getting his hands into was not something to be in human hands or something like that. And by some reason, unless they want to up the show's quality by some notches, I also think Charioce won't die, even with Idiot Azazel wanting to kill him.\n\nThere's something I noticed in the ED. Maybe there are others that noticed this too, but with Rocky, I found pretty hilarious that the clothes Rocky has basically form a face in Rocky's palm. The two yellow dots are his eyes and the red half-circle is his mouth. I found it pretty hilarious."

This either that bahamut is a specific power that is related to dragons that allows them to take on gods and any dragon can do this, nina is related to bahamut or both.  So I just choose to believe that every dragon is related to bahamut and every one has the potential to become a bahamut."
