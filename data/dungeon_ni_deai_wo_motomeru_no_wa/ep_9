Do you remember the fight where Bell killed the minotaur and levelled up? That one fight was more hard-fought, the victory hard-earned and the animation more fluid than anything in Oratoria so far. Bell could have died on many occasions; that's how high the stakes were.\n\nIn contrast I never felt like any of the characters in Oratoria were ever in danger of dying. And I don't get why the characters could not have just rearmed themselves; they were literally surrounded by armed adventurers and shops. \n\nEven frying pan makes a mean weapon given sufficient velocity.\n\nhttp://www.newsleader.com/story/news/local/2017/02/14/staunton-woman-charged-frying-pan-attack/97887018/\n\nhttp://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Man-Who-Assaulted-Girlfriend-With-Frying-Pan-at-Large-417872303.html\n\nhttps://ithacavoice.com/2017/02/ithaca-man-charged-assault-frying-pan/\n\n"

There's a reason she's part of the Loki familia and not someone like Hestia's like Bell. Her actual strength hasn't changed from the start, she always had her power but just couldn't use it in the scenes we got to see.\n\n> It's the same journey of getting strong, just flavored a little differently.\n\nWell this journey only took 3 episodes then.

Mental strength is part of overall strength. If you can't use your powers because of mental blocks then you're no different from a person who is powerless but has no mental blocks. You have to overcome your obstacle before you can be useful in battle. \n\n> Well this journey only took 3 episodes then.\n\nAwesome, just 3 episodes waste on something we've already seen."

For example, the indirect kiss thing that was at the end of this episode doesn't exist in the manga.\n\nShe indeed is similar to Bell in many things especially regarding Ais, but, if you read the manga for example, you can see she does have her own badass growth and her own problems different from Bell's.\n\nYou should read the manga if you aren't enjoying this. It is pretty cool but you will still have Lefiya as much time as she has now with all the chapters that are translated, and even the chapters that comes after Lefiya still has a lot of time until vol 6 in the LNs, which in manga chapters is around... more or less 25 chapters in the future?. vol 7 does equalize the time between everyone and in vol 8 she doesn't make a lot of appearances, giving that time mostly to Bete.\n\nThe manga does cut out some minor things that happen with another characters though, but until now everything is pretty much the same thing as the LNs."

One could see as how well the Bell from the beginning had come through in those episodes to the Bell he was in the end.\n\nNow, I do agree that here with Sword Oratoria the adaptation could have been a lot better, specially with combining scenes and changing the order a little of a couple of things, but the thing is that since the beginning, in the source, Ais and Lefiya have this amount of time dedicated to them, way more time than almost all the other characters of the Loki familia combined I believe, and you couldn't tell the story to the point where they want to get without developing Lefiya as a character, and there's the issue that one of her important scenes is tied to an event in the story, so they couldn't just turn around and put it elsewhere. Also, in the source, while we do have an introduction to Ais' story and quest (for the lack of a better word), it is not until later after some scenes focused on Lefiya that Ais story starts to truly roll on. \n\nSo, I can see the problem here, since if they move important events a lot, the story depicted in the show wouldn't be the story of the source, and that could give the author and the studio some problems. Danmachi and Sword Oratoria are done just as advertisement (Sadly) for the LNs and maybe manga, they can't just change a lot of the story, and since the adaptation of Sword Oratoria will cover a lot of ground with a lot of characters from the start, cramming everything is pretty hard.\n\nDanmachi adaptation had an advantage regarding its storytelling, and that is that Bell is basically alone for the first episodes, with Hestia being there and there, and by the end of the show we have 3 well developed characters that are Bell, Lily and Welf, and the others that aren't that well developed but we can relate to, specially Mikoto. The adaptation carefully started to include more and more characters and depict they relation with Bell before moving on to the next new one. Here in Sword Oratoria we have a large cast from the start, which from the very source two have major screentime from the beginning, which are Ais and Lefiya, and the others which together have the other half of the screentime. Sword Oratoria needs to cover a lot of ground and cover for a lot of characters, specially the ones that move forward the story at the beginning, and that's why I think they are focusing first on Lefiya so when Rivira act kicks in we can focus on Ais fully, and then have these two balance the screentime between them and the Loki familia until the end. \n\nIt could have been a lot better, yeah, but it is not easy to balance all of these factors from a story that already is set in stone.\n\nI agree with you in something, I don't like that they turned Lefiya into a Loki-type-fanatic of Ais just to use Yuri-bait. She had her own more normal ways to admire Ais, which is sad to see that they cut just to put yuri-bait."

I also think that there's not enough tension built on Lefiya, compared to the manga source. The monster's attack is supposed to pierce through her abdomen, yet they didn't show that specifically. The attack is supposed to disable her. That's the important part, because Lefiya is supposed to pull herself together and braved herself to move and save the other 3 who were in a pinch. I think the pacing around that part was too quick, and they didn't emphasize on these small but crucial details that build up to her Burst Ring attack.\n\nI'm thoroughly disappointed, as this episode is supposed to lift Lefiya's character up from \"useless Aiz fangirl\" to \"kickass Aiz fangirl\".\n\nedit: They even cut off Bell's scene!"

However, they should really have made those things a bit more entertaining.\n\nOverall this show has all the *elements* to be interesting, but doesn't use them well. For example, I usually like characters like Lefiya as long as they evolve. But everytime she fails in battle (which is the cause of her lack of confidence) it's because she doesn't get protection during her incantation, not because of her own weakness.\n\nDemeter and Freya are pulling shady shit. Okay. They could have shown this with a short shot, giving of an appropriate atmosphere and making them seem like a threat, like they did with Uranus in episode 1. Instead we get a useless conversation, without conclusion (first time Loki left, the other time it was Freya, showing that even them had no interest in this), and their intentions conveyed through discussion only. \"Show, don't tell\" should be reminded to the studio.\n\n> Not Aiz being a badass\n\nBut I need more of it !"

Of course, if there isn't a payoff or something interesting in the next two episodes I'll consider dropping it, but the show seems keen on this Lefiya character to be a sort of Bell, and Dionysus to be her Freya. How it will relate to the story of the main heroine (which is and so obviously has to be Ais as the show is set up) I don't know. But if the sub character is indeed going to act as a catalyst to motivate her and does it in the next couple of episodes, I'd be okay with how things pan out. \n\nI think one of the hardest things about watching a spinoff rather than a direct sequel is to find joy in watching the first few episodes because you feel like you know the entire setting already and they're wasting your time when trying to tell it all over again with really little to no new interesting information added. These are the setup episodes. I'll hold my judgement until at least the mid season. \n\nAlso, is it just me or does this [Dionysus](http://imgur.com/5hKj9mU) remind anyone else of a sandal-wearing, ukulele-toting [wise man](http://imgur.com/2ikY5Wh)? Imagine if instead of Hestia reading the name of the next episode we get, \"*Jikai*, *Satsujin to*\" then \"***Jewel***\" in a super American accent. "

She's also very supportive and breathes life into Aiz's character.\n\nSo why does she look pathetic ? I think so far they really didn't manage well their video game style, showing little of each class' role and their synergy.\n\n[Evidence.](https://i.imgur.com/QyMZi0c.jpg) The enemy is able to attack from underground and disrupt the caster's spell. It wasn't even a particularly long cast, as she purposefully chose a short spell. In any video game, that would spell aggro management (unless it unbalanced and the high level Concurrent Chanting is a must-have skill). Except Tione and Tiona should not have any problem with aggro management... So this scene didn't make any sense.\n\nAnd I don't think you need to play video games to realize that the way they don't show any need to protect your backline caster is wrong.\nAlso why didn't the monsters attack from underground when she cast her Elf Ring, anyway ?"

They basically made her a female Bell, and while I love him (full homo) that loses a lot of her characterization from the LNs. She looks up to Aiz, but she doesn't adore her like she seems to in this. She doesn't get her motivation from wanting to catch up to Aiz, but more from wanting to be useful and not be a burden. The latter is much more interesting to explore as an adventurer trying to find a place in a familia with so many strong members, in contrast to Hestia familia in season 1. As much as I love Bell's arc, we've seen that already. \n\nI'm also kind of disappointed in the fight scene animation as well after the masterpiece minotaur fight from season 1, but I guess it's to be expected in a low budget spin off. \n\n**TL;DR: JC Staff pls**\n\nEdit: wait they cut the scene with Aiz seeing Bell defeat the silverback, wtf? Maybe we will get it next episode but I kind of doubt it. They are really missing out on all the characterization of Aiz that was the whole point of the spin off LNs... "

How the flying hell did she get to LEVEL THREE if she's this much of a anxious mess?\n\nDid she just tag along with a group and throw out spells from across the globe to not succumb to her nerves? The writing for her character is hot garbage.  Not only are her inner thoughts something that's hard to sympathize with or find entertaining. She has basically no justification to be as high level as she is.\n\nYou know what would make her character make some damn sense? If a spell misfire got someone she cared about killed. That way it's overcoming trauma and not FNG jitters that have no business being on someone who has been adventuring the better part of a year or more.  \n\nRemember, Bell was a record setter by hitting level 2 within a month.  Which means that even with a linear level progression that she has likely been at this a while.\n\nBete's a prick, and I'm not a fan of him.
