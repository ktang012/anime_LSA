There is a lot of excess movement. Ultimately rule of cool wins out. The animation is solid, and I'm not student of the medium, but I think camera work, and direction carries a lot of the load. That moving background and foreground does a lot to make for a more dynamic shot.\n\nFluid animation can still be had without the sweeping, excess movement. It's actually easier for me to spot when the focus is a narrower. Those gorgeous, subtle movements truly become the highlight. Historia's shot didn't ruin immersion for me the way it did for you, but I can see how it could for others and it's a shame you can't point this out without inviting down votes just because people disagree."

Historia at this point really hasn't done much to show off her skills and even this bit of animation is kinda pointless because it's not in service of something. Mikasa's scene was again a bit too much movement for my taste but ultimately it was there to show off how badass she was as she positioned herself in a way which would allow her to pull of a precise action. \n\nIn contrast this scene mainly made me go 'eh?' because I didn't know what it was supposed to portray other than \"look at our animation which we are going to hide with a bunch of light so as a scene it's actually kinda messy.\". That's more about what this is, the animation itself is good but as you said smaller movements tend to be more impressive - I'm not trying to say \"AoT is shitty and overhyped lol\" but that doesn't preclude it from criticism. Also the fact that scene came out of nowhere and accomplished nothing is to its detriment not a positive.\n\nFor some context, I am saying all this as someone who loves animation and loves watching nice animation...but even if I wanted to the actual animation in this scene was so all-over the place and then they added the blinding sun on top of that. I guess I have no say in how other people enjoy stuff and I want to thank you for your reasoned response, I'm glad you enjoyed the scene.\n\nDownvotes are whatever, you can't be critical of AoT without attracting them."

Obviously Korean and Japanese were both at one point written in Chinese hanzi, then Japanese developed hiragana/katakana, where Korean developed hangeul. Vietnamese has been written in Chinese hanzi and then French inspired Roman alphabet with lots of markings.\n\nEven English, during the period when it was transitioning to the Roman alphabet, could at one time have been written in the old [Anglosaxon runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Saxon_runes) or the Roman alphabet we use today (although due to diachronic language change, you and I still couldn't understand that older English written in our alphabet without studying)."

See, normally if you was to go one-on-one with a Titan, you got a 50-50 chance of surviving.  But Mikasa is a main character and not normal.  So she has a 25% chance AT BEST, of dying.  Then you add the Armored Titan to the mix, my chances of surviving drastic go down.  See the 3 way, retrieving Eren, I got a 33 1/3 chance of winning but Mikasa, has a 66 2/3 chance of surviving because Mikasa KNOWS she's a main character and she's not even gonna die.  So audience, you take Mikasa's 33 1/3 chance minus her 25% chance and she's got a 8 1/3 chance of dying in the show.  But then you take my 75% chance of dying, if it was a one-on-one, and then add my 66 2/3 chance percents, I got a 141 2/3 chance of dying on the next mission.  MIKASA AKERMAN!

She was about kill Erwin and ended up saving him instead. I thought she was with Reiner & Bert? Then she saves Bert when she could\u2019ve escaped with Historia. Her reasoning was beautifully done though.\n\n- This is the first time Mikasa has been 100% genuine with Eren. This is the closest we\u2019ve gotten to a confession and I\u2019ll fucking take it. Eren even went full tsundere when he \u2018accepted her feelings.\u2019\n\n- Now I know it seems like an asspull at first glance, but Eren having that ability was foreshadowed back in [Episode 10](http://i.imgur.com/F1CPqeK.png). They both knew of the power\u2019s existence and that\u2019s why they kidnapped him, according to Ymir. (But rest easy, there is a reason it activated right then and there but\u2026spoilers)\n\n- So yeah\u2026Eren commanded the nearby Titans & Reiner was shitting bricks when he did so. ~~I wonder why he\u2019s \u201cthe one person in the world you wouldn't want to have it\u201d?~~ nvm. Eren immediately confirms Reiner\u2019s worst fears and sets all the Titans on him. MC too OP, pls nerf.\n\n- THAT LAST SCENE. THE MADMEN ACTUALLY DID IT. THE BALLS ON STUDIO WIT. I knew they'd pull some wild shit and they delivered.\n\nWelp, we\u2019re finally at the end of WIT\u2019s wild ride. I think S2 has matured from S1, sacrificing some style (action & hype moments) for more substance (more character development & dynamics). IMO, I think it\u2019s been better than S1.\n\n(BTW, judging from [this S3 announcement](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x5qz3gq) [potential spoilers inside], it'll be at least 2-cours which is AMAZING narratively)"

So naturally, one would assume that the name refers to the endless onslaught of the Titans into human territory, and the way they keep pushing us back. But 'Kyoujin' doesn't necessarily refer to multiple Titans; if we think of it as being singular, we get 'Titan of the Advance/Charge', which can only refer to Eren and his ability to bring the fight to the Titans and reclaim their conquered territory. So hey, that's a pretty neat double meaning, but it doesn't explain the awkwardness of 'Attack on Titan'.\")\n\n[BUT.](/s \"Then it's revealed that the Titan power Eren inherited is that of a specific Titan, unique in the same way as the Colossal Titan and Armored Titan. And the Japanese name for that Titan is... Shingeki no Kyoujin. Some have translated it as 'Charging Titan' or 'Advance Titan' (I prefer 'Vanguard Titan' myself), but a far simpler translation is 'Attack Titan'. So when you take into consideration those three different meanings behind 'Shingeki no Kyoujin', it sorta makes sense why we ended up with 'Attack on Titan'. They were trying to make the English title have several layers of meaning, the way the Japanese title does. They sorta got two of them (Eren attacking the Titans and the name of his Titan form), and the result of their effort sounds silly to English speakers, but I can understand how they ended up where they did.\")"

Annie killed people when they got in her way, but it was mostly just to preserve her own life as she tried to get to Eren. Bertholt and Reiner smashed the walls, indirectly killing thousands, but they don't go out of their way to kill people either. Ymir killed people as a mindless Titan, but once she became a Titan Shifter, we haven't seen her do anything like that.

The rest of the humans can forcibly be made titans through whatever power Monkey Business has, but they're just giant regenerating zombies after that.\n\nAn an anime only watcher i thought this became really clear in today's episode. People like ymir are made into titans (when she got knocked off the wall in the flashback you hear a very clear injection sound and than the lightning/sound of a titan transforming), and then they have to consume another titan-shifter to become human again (this is the part that became very clear in today's episode). We know ymir ate a shifter because who else would of been traveling along side 3 other titan-shifters? There is also a hint towards this in the earlier episodes where ymir/reiner said neither of them remember their first and most likely eren doesn't as well (their \"first\" as in their first time eating a titan-shifter is what i'm getting from it).\n\nThe only thing i'm still wondering is where do the special titan powers come from, like reiner being the armored titan and Bertolt being a colossus and annie having some crystal powers and now eren being able to control titans, and as far as we know ymir atm has no special power like this. (though if you're a manga reader please don't actually answer this).\n"

I mean Eren, Annie, and Ymir's titan forms all kind of match their personalities: Eren's the berserker, swinging his arms wildy as his wild tongue flails around in his unhinged jaw--aligning with his savage hatred of titans; Annie's is a stone cold fortress with her precise movements and crystallizing ability--and she's pretty much impenetrable as a human, able to block off any and all emotions. I mean she infiltrated the military police completely unnoticed save for one incredibly perceptive genius; and Ymir's looks so menacing, masculine and muscular that she might as well be feral--considering she lived outside the walls as a mindless titan, removed from society, for centuries, it couldn't be more accurate.\n\nBut then there's Reiner and Bertolt and I can't really figure out how theirs fit. Especially Bertolt--but we don't really know much about him except that he's an exceptionally good liar."

They theorize Eren doesn't remember either because of how he behaved(remember they were all there when that happened). In the first season when Eren turned into a titan he was barely in control of himself, then he learned that he could only really shift when he had a goal in mind and even then he could more or less only complete that goal. Compare that to the \"veteran\" shifters who can pop in and out of titan form and even maintain it while only being partially connected. Ymir is even good enough to almost speak clearly and the Beast titan can not only speak perfectly fine but in that final scene he didn't even seem to be in his titan form anymore but it was still just sitting there.

Perhaps that was why Commander Erwin was smiling at such a revelation: With Eren at their side, it is now possible to fightback against whoever is behind these Titans.\n\n- Now to look forward to Eren zerg-rushing his Titan Army at his enemies while proclaiming [**I AM THE SWARM!**](https://youtu.be/MVbeoSPqRs4)\n\n- Mikasa looking absolutely [cute and gorgeous](https://i.imgur.com/RHyJDhM.jpg) in her non-confession just before Eren awakened his Coordinate power and avenged his mother's and Hannes' deaths.\n\n- Second best ship: Ymir x Historia. Sort of understand her reason for leaving with Reiner now that she feels Historia has a future with Eren in her side, upon learning of Eren's Coordinate ability. But I don't know if they'll ever meet again.\n\n- Poor Connie. Hope he gets his revenge soon.\n\n- Despite his badassery, Corporal Levy has criminally minimal screen time this season. Let us hope this is rectified next season.\n\n- Beast Titan pretty much confirmed to be a Shifter human as well, with his real human self emerging from his Titan \"cockpit\" looking in from Wall Maria. It'll be interesting to see whether he has any relationship with Reiner and co. Perhaps he's the Commanding Officer of the invasion and extermination army?"

Megafauna being the majestic creatures of Earth's history, Earth's greatest hits.

   "text": "Here's my take on the symbolism:\n\nI think the animals represents the titans.\n\nIn this anime, there are large things killing small things. And just like in nature there are large and small animals, although not everything that is huge has to kill everything that is smaller than it.\n\nThere is still the danger of being killed by one (trampled, accidentally being sat on or eaten, etc.), even if it's not really its goal.\n\n\nAlso, being big doesn't mean you are safe. Many of those large animals are endangered species. I think the point of showing dinosaurs (there is also a [Parasaurolophus](http://i.imgur.com/S0QN9BV.jpg) beside MT, apart from the T-rex, Plesiosaurus and the Spinosaurus) is to show that even if they are large creatures, they still fell victim to extinction.\n\nSo basically... The titans are just like these big animals shown in the OP. They are large and dangerous, but the OP also implies that they can also be vulnerable.\n"

Best of luck drunk uncle. \n\n* That voice crack from Jean: 'Don't stand in our way, you big sack of shit.'\n\n* The part where Kristoria and Ymir are talking, I'm honestly focusing more on the piano music'\n\n* Don't live for other people, only live for ourselves. Krista sounding like a shounen villain there. Interesting stuff\n\n* Ah the traditional action Sawano song\n\n* Oh that glorious camera spin [](#awe). Fantastic that Ymir is fighting with the scouts\n\n* Lol Hannes fighting the titan. He's aiming his grapples at empty air and shooting off after them. Eh, it looks great. \n\n* So Eren's failure to transform in time will lead to Hannes' death\n\n* Well the mood's gone south. Everyone dying or on the verge of being eaten and for some reason Eren can't do anything to save them. Hopefully the reason is part of the lore and not an empty excuse so deaths happen.

What a brutal death and a reminder that SNK has far less main character protection than most anime\n\n* Poor Eren\n\n* When Mikasa is thanking Eren, the titan that appears behind them looks a heck of a lot like Hannes. \n\n* **NANI?????

Could it have been in the serum Eren's father gave him. Perhaps he's intended to be the heir of the King's Blood\n\n* Glad to see Ymir rescue Bert and Reiner.

They're good characters\n\n* Oh hey it's the underground city from the Levi OVA.\n\n* Erwin is in good shape\n\n* The SNK people now catch on that titans are humans, though to their credit they didn't have time and lots of people to theorise with\n\n* That last scene is movie-esque. So good. \n\n* So new guy in cahoots with Monkey Trouble. Alrighty then.\n\nEdit: Alright, I thought the guy who someone new when I watched the scene.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nExcellent episode to one of my absolute favourite seasons. SNK stands out from so many others and part of the reason is it executes the feeling of a grand story. Moment after moment stands as some of the best scenes by a cinematic point of view I've seen in anime: Ymir's reveal, Reiner and Berts, Reiner vs Eren, the twists, reveals and all which fed tons of discussions and theorising.

Hopefully the reason is part of the lore and not an empty excuse so deaths happen. It wasn't like he was lacking in motivation\n\nJust want to draw your attention back to the episode in the trees, with Reiner telling Eren he can't transform while he's still regenerating.  Many people wondered if Reiner was bluffing about that.  Looks to me like Eren not being able to transform at this moment, when he's not *quite* finished healing, supports what Reiner said.\n  \nI think it's also somewhat supported by Berthold not shifting into a titan at several points when his life has been in extreme danger, and Reiner feeling that he needs to protect Bert.  It implies that probably Bert can't shift as often due to his titan being larger, so he has to just survive in human form for now.  Clearly there are certain limits on shifting and it seems that Reiner and Bert understand them way better than Eren."

   "text": "You know, I wasn't really feeling S2 to be honest. We finally got some much-needed characterization, but it was often done through uninspired flashbacks. I didn't like Reiner's 'split personality', it felt way too convenient for the story. I didn't like the use of CG for the horse formations and Colossal Titan, it was just too jarring. I didn't like that S2 went on to raise more questions than it answered just as S1 did. \n\n**But this episode solidified it for me that AoT is worth every second. It had everything.**\n\nAll those moments of characterization paid off in that single massive fight. Reiner and Bertold being torn between their mission and their (former) comrades; the terror that Titans can instill; the death of Hannes the drunk fuck; Mikasa finally confessing her feelings for Eren.\n\nSo let's talk about these moments. \n\n* I like that Mikasa confessed, went in for the kiss, and missed because Eren's head was already somewhere else, literally and figuratively. In those moments, maybe realizing she would die, she thought 'it's now or never.' Eren, on the other hand, found some fighting spirit within him. A kiss would've been appropriate if they had died, but Eren wasn't ready to give up yet. Mikasa has always protected him, and now, just maybe, he can return the favor.\n\n* That moment is also when Eren's (minor) characterization pays off. The only trait he had in S1 is that he was angry. All. The. Time. It was annoying. In S2, he has to learn to keep it in check, or it will get him and his friends killed in no time. Now that we know that Eren can control titans, it is even *more* important that he controls his emotions. We saw that *one* thought, Eren wanting to kill Reiner and Bertold, can be devastating. And for what it's worth, I think Eren will reciprocate Mikasa's feelings when the time is right.\n\n* The action, animation, music, voice acting, directing, all of it was just on point in that final battle. The perfect mix of epic, horrifying, sad, romantic. \n\n* Hannes dying was a little clich\u00e9 and anyone with at least three working brain cells saw it coming, but it was done well regardless. The one thing I didn't like was Hannes stopping the titan's blow with his body: that just physically doesn't make sense. Even though I knew Hannes was dying, there was a small part of me that thought: Eren might heal just in time, turn into a titan, and rescue everyone. But of course that doesn't happen, and Hannes' death mirrors that of his mom, completely breaking him. What follows is an amazing scene, with top-notch visuals and voice acting. Eren crying and laughing maniacally, Mikasa trying to comfort him, titans raging and closing in in the background, the shot of the flowers, Mikasa's beautiful face as she confesses. Eren says nothing changed, but Mikasa disagrees. He *did* change. *He* changed. And then the climax. It was all just perfect.\n\nI'm glad S2 ended this way, and I'm looking forward to S3. I won't be reading the manga, because I don't care about the story enough to read more than the anime shows. Besides, AoT is one of those shows that really benefits from the movement and sound animation can bring, and Studio WIT fucking brought it."

But Levi isn't the type of guy who can come up with complicated strategies, he is a good squad leader but wouldn't fit in as a General.

Eren and Mikasa's dynamic always felt one sided but after this episode it's clear Eren always did care about her he just felt inferior. I love the way the two always have each others backs and seeing Mikasa lay her heart out like that was beautiful, too bad Eren was too dense to notice she was leaning in for the kiss. It's also lovely how Eren checks on Armin as he tries his best to defend Jean. Beasty Boy lookn fresh at the end though ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0).

   "text": "So last time I said\n\n\n>I wonder how that titan that ate Eren's mom wandered all the way out here. Also, no way Hannes doesn't die. They bring back this titan, of all titans, its near the end, Eren is frozen solid, and Hannes is defending Eren against the titan that he fled at the beginning that ate Eren's mom. This is the end for him.\n\n\nAnd wow shocker, he died against the same titan he fled from years ago, wow, who could've guessed...\n\n\nI thought that scene was bad just because of (1) how unbearably dumb it is for the *exact same titan* to appear *at that location and time* and (2) how in your face it is. Like I get it, Hannes has changed and is more brave, he's going to stay and fight instead of running away, but it's too obvious when they use the same titan. It would make more sense for it to be a random titan, because that's all Smiles ever was, just a random titan who ate Eren's mom. There's nothing bigger than that, she's just another victim of a normal titan attack. The smiling titan is like Joe Chill. The point is how normal he is, he just represents the terror of all titans to normal people.\n\n\nThey should have used a different titan, just another random one, and it would've been better, since that way the focus is on Hannes' growth from coward to soldier, and not on \"revenge\" against this one specific titan. It takes away from what the Smiling Titan was, which was just a normal titan. He never should've appeared again, like Joe Chill. Because the specific character isn't what matters, it what he represents.\n\n\nSo using the same titan just beats you over the head with it to the point where its silly. That's just my opinion though. \n\n\nThat somewhat love confession was nice. I think that's the most words Mikasa's said that's not Eren this season.\n\n\n>I'll wrap that around you as many times as you want.\n\n\nOh my. Eren this isn't the time, calm down you horn dog.\n\n\nOh hey, we finally learn something about the Coordinate and why the villains want it. Progress is good, though Eren punching the titan's palm was kind of silly.\n\n\nYmir joined Bert 'n ~~Ernie~~Reiner because of course she did.\n\n\nThe characters finally conclude that the giant human-looking guys who have specific smart members that are humans transformed are actually humans transformed. Solid progress on that front.\n\n\nWe get a glimpse of what the Beast Titan's person looks like, but it doesn't particularly matter since I don't think we know him. Maybe if he shows up next season in disguise, it'd be big, but so far its just kinda eh.\n\n\nLast time I also said\n\n\n>Man I was really hoping Bertholt and Reiner captured Eren, Christa, or both. Just so we could learn something about the villains, like damn, I'll be super salty if this ends with both sides getting away and no one learning anything. The most that was revealed to the characters was Reiner & Bertholt being revealed, and then us viewers got backstory on Ymir and a glimpse of titan lore. But that's not really enough for a whole season, like please.\n\n\nUnfortunately for me, we learned nothing more about our villains like what their goal is or what's special about Christa, or what the Church knows and what their goal is, but we did learn what's special about Eren, so that was pretty cool. \n\n\nI'm glad the next season won't take 4 years, but I hope they make some solid plot progress, because it's been pretty glacial. They keep introducing new plot threads and not following up on them. That can only happen so much before its exasperating.\n\n\nOverall I enjoyed the season but am disappointed we got more questions but less answers."

It's way too over-the-top. Joe Chill himself isn't important, it's what he represents, which is the average criminal committing an average crime. Batman chose to fight all crime, not just Joe Chill, so there's no reason for him to ever run into him again. On the same note, Eren swore to fight all titans, so reusing the one titan that ate his mom is pointless and trying too hard."

   "text": "> Well first of all your entire analogy to joe chill is wrong because this is not a random titan, it is an integral plot point that has not come up yet which leads into the reason i believe the whole rant is stupid\n\n\nFrom my perspective so far, it has been a random titan. It's shown no intelligence above the average titan, so there's been no reason to believe it's any different. That's not my fault, its the writer's fault. They wrote the story in such a way that the titan that ate Eren's mother is displayed to the viewer/reader as an average titan.\n\n\n>the show is not done yet you are ranting on about this titan when it can and will be shown that it was not just a random titan\n\n\nThis is poor logic, as a season, and episode, should stand on its own merits, not for \"future\" information to be revealed. Saying you can't criticize a show until its done is ridiculous; by that logic, no one should criticize any Star Wars movies until the Sequel Trilogy is done, because the plot's still going. See how silly that sounds? A movie, season, and episode should seem not-dumb on its own merits, and it's perfectly valid to criticize an episode in a show within a completed season. \n\n\n>I can understand if it was like season 1 where we were not sure of a next season but it was already confirmed dude.\n\n\nThe confirmation of a season doesn't mean I can't criticize this one nor criticize how they've presented plot points.\n\n\n>All i'm saying is that ranting about stuff like that when you don't know everything is just stupid imo because you can end up spouting completely wrong nonsense and look stupid like what happened to you.\n\n\nYou've been really repetitive, so I'll continue to reply the same. It's ridiculous to state a product such as an episode or season, which are both their own completed products, cannot be criticized because future elements have not been revealed. By that logic, no one can criticize The Force Awakens because the next two haven't come out, which is ridiculous. If the writer is going to present a ridiculous scenario, I can criticize it for being ridiculous. If he is going to make the most un-subtle moment possible by bringing this one specific titan to this one specific location in this one specific time so that Hannes can have his redemption by fighting the specific titan he ran away from before, I am going to criticize it for beating us over the head with contrast. \n\n\nAnd the part of my comment you latched onto doesn't even matter, as regardless of it the titan is important or not, it still takes away form Hannes' moment. Because Hannes should be staying and fighting regardless of what titan he's fighting, because his battle is internal, it's overcoming his own fear. He wasn't just afraid of the Smiling Titan at the time, he was afraid of all titans, that's why he ran. So bringing back the smiling titan for this moment takes away from the fact that Hannes has overcome his fear and is protecting Eren unlike the time he abandoned Eren's mom, as it makes it seem like he's only overcome his fear of this one titan. They could draw comparisons without it being super obvious; using the exact same titan is just blatant and bad writing in my opinion. That was the main point of my argument, yet you latched onto a detail I had no way of knowing while avoiding the meat of what I was saying.\n\n\nAnd back on the point of the Smiling Titan, it being a specific plot point sounds like a dumb retcon to me. Again, it would be better if it was a random titan, as it makes Eren and Eren's mother victims of just another titan attack; it shows that the titans don't care who they attack or eat, which is part of the horror. They are indiscriminate. Yet making it some allegedly specific titan attack takes away from that by giving an ulterior motive, a way Eren could \"avenge\" his mom, which takes away from the fact that Eren wants to eradicate all titans, not just the ones who wronged him, the same way Batman wants to protect all citizens of Gotham from crimes, not just stop Joe Chill. That's why I brought up the Joe Chill comparison.\n\n"

Individual acts are susceptible to criticism as well.\n\n\nAnother comparison is to books in series. Each book could be seen as merely a bigger chapter in an even larger story, but each individual book can be criticized for its own pace, plot, characters, etc., even before they finish the story. In my opinion, Book 6 of Harry Potter was extremely slow, had terribly rushed romantic development with too large a focus on it and little mystery. That conclusion can be drawn before Book 7 is read. Now if in Book 7 they explained that the rushed romance was due to some odd spell, that doesn't make Book 6 a better story, or better written, if there were no hints as to any odd-doings. It, by itself, would still just seem like a bad romance story. So it would still be open to criticism.\n\n\nAny part of a story can be criticized. A specific act can be criticized, as it is its own part, that's why there divided into acts. You can criticize specific scenes as well, such as being pointless, or out of place. You can criticize lines of dialogue. You don't have to finish the entire story to criticize how something is presented or done."

If Eren being angry and wanting to kill a titan activates it, it should have happened before, right?\n\nThere's a reason for it but that's in Season 3, maybe 4. Don't worry,  it isn't as lame as Eren needing to be angry.\n\n> Lastly, I wonder why Eren would punch air.\n\nCause full of emotions, desperate and not thinking properly.\n\n"

Hmmm first thing came to mind is a connection with Erwin or Armin. The fact that they juxtaposed Erwin's smile on \"we've gotten closer to the truth\" with that guy's \"Not yet, eh\" makes me believe this more than anything. Is beast titan Erwin's dad? Uncle?\nCome to think of it, we've had exactly no backstory on Erwin, why did he join the scout regiment? What's out there that he's looking for?\n\nThese questions led me to believe there's more to Erwin than we've seen, especially that we now know that even Levi doesn't know his intentions from their last conversation. \n\nReally excited for season 3.\n"

So I think that there was this one guy that betrayed them and had the Coordinate power and got 50meter Titans and made them into the wall (we know that the Beast Titan made the citizens of Ragako into Titans), so maybe he made regular humans into 50 meter ones and made them make the walls for him.

Marley think that the king is going to gather titan power and destroy the world. Top Marleys don't think this, but low rank and Eldians do.

Eren and the scouts could be working to free themselves from false memories and try to live freely, rather than destroy the world. They could control the titans and avoid suffocating inside the walls. However, if Ymir thinks along these lines, she would be placing too much trust in Eren to proclaim that \"there is a future\". Ymir barely knows him.  \nIf we think that Ymir fears Historia being killed due to being an illegitimate daughter, Eren having coordinate barely has any effect. The king faction, apart from being Eldian masters, still wants Historia dead.\")  \n  \nSo why does Ymir say \"there is (no) future\"?

It's already been several generations ago when King walled himself in. However, if Ymir fears Historia will get killed by the king faction, Eren having coordinate shouldn't make Ymir say there is a future after all\")  \n  \nLastly, Ymir thinks she does Historia a favor by taking her with Reiner and Berthold (previous episodes) but [Spoiler](/s \"She will simply live like a slave or a science experiment. Royal bloodline can make better use of titan powers I believe, but how is life with Marleys any better than inside the walls? Does Ymir really not realize how shitty Historia will be treated by the Marleys? Or does Ymir think something inside the walls is WORSE than being a royal Eldian?\")  \n  \n[Conclusion, smaller spoiler](/s \"Either I'm missing something, or Ymir thinks incorrectly when claiming Historia will have a better future with Marleys compared to inside the walls.

And not everyone is a badass in anime, in my opinion Eren is the realest I've seen since he knows he's powerless at the moment and all he can do is cry which humanized him for me. What would the normal guy do? Fucking act tough or some shit? I'd cry when I see a giant set to eat me"
