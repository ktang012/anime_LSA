Because while most people don't face crazy drama, or have eccentric zany personalites; we all have been 14. And exemplifying that awkward, weird transitional time is where this series shines. They do this by reminding our selfs of our clumsy, boring, selfs stumbling through puberty in much the same way. So if they wrote them to have deep heavy dialog, rather than bullshit small talk, it would lose more than it gain because it just wouldn't feel as true to reality."

Who can name one confused regular teenager who *wants* their own little chaos and missteps known all throughout the school.\n\n> Miu\n\nAll of theirs were great, I wouldn't know which one to choose but I hope she was just messing with him this time (\"I wish I were here with a boyfriend\"). That relationship isn't allowed to end :(\n\nAnd the teacher going from drinking out of a champagne flute in one to the whole bottle in the next was harsh :D"

In the early episode the other girls asked what did she like about Koutaro, and she didn't know what he actually liked. By the end of the episode she discovers what most women like about men, \"feeling safe and rely on us guys\". The band aid scene pretty much reinforced this (I wonder if these japanese festivals have some band aid stall, because boy is this a used trope or what). Plus she was astounded watching Koutaro dance. Like I said in previous episodes this reminds me a bit of \"True Tears\" where the male MC was a pretty good traditional dancer.\n\nI knew there was a good reason to specifically like the [windchimes](http://i.imgur.com/UY064h8.jpg) ever since I saw the new OP in the recap episode.\n\nSo nice they also beat using their last name when they call each other.\n\nThe extras are so nice (except Aira & kaneko's clip, I hate that smug guy)\n\nSensei having such a crush on pinkhead Roman. They better give us something meaningful of these two when he graduates.\n\nMiou is such a [savage](http://i.imgur.com/Qdf6oX4.jpg). Even the cute oddball Sakura gets some attention.\n\nThe bit with Koutaro's parent is probably the one I enjoyed the most, by showing such opposite opinions on the same script."

   "text": "Wow I thought he was being bold as brass calling her by her first name without asking first, then BAM he straight up finishes that kiss from last week. Considering how much of palaver the whole first name business can be in other anime, it was so good to get it out the way quickly, let alone the first kiss. Those two are also lucky to have some great bros at their back, the reaction from the guys at drum practice was great.\n\nWhile this show ain't the prettiest at times, some of the [backgrounds](http://i.imgur.com/ys8h1MF.png) during the [temple scene](http://i.imgur.com/nXq1f66.png) were gorgeous.\n\nThis show constantly surprising me, I thought Roman would be the one crushing in the Roman x Sensei scenes, but it's actually her instead. I'm more than a little worried that he only thinks she cute and nothing more, even before we get on to the ethics involved."

From the beginning he seemed like a super shy kid and even Akane's friends peg him as not having \"guts\", but he's always been so straight-forward and strong. "

Shy is just being uncomfortable in social situations; both of these characters are shy, sure - both with their friends and each other, they're different.
