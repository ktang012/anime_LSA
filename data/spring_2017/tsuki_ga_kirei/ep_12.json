I think more shows would be like \"he's into reading, she's into running, what wacky opposites!\" but here it felt like interests they had which didn't like own their personalities and whatnot. it's pretty cool to see a bookworm boy who still has his group of friends that mess with eachother and an interest in things like gravure magazines and also have an athletic girl who is still somewhat shy meeting with others and enjoys talking through chat apps. could've easily had a tomboy and a tomgirl but didn't and I think that made it better maybe!"

I'm sure many of us have laughed at something trivial or goofed around with our own cliques. In essence, it indicates their closeness and, more importantly, highlights the show's focus on simplicity\n\nKotarou punching his light-switch let's us know immediately how he's feeling: hyped up and ready to take on the world. Who wouldn't feel that way after getting your crush's number and texting her up? Sure, he gives us another small quote from Dazai about \"gold\" in a \"river of grief,\" but his way of interpreting his current feelings aligns with his own main characteristic (i.e., being a bookworm).\n\nIn the grand scheme, these seem like simple, not-so-important scenes. But they are doing a *lot* through their normalcy. And that's what the anime is highlighting very well right now: the normal. Kotarou being interested in the porn mag at his age, Akane messing with her sister's phone after she teased her, and the humbly awkward situation at the diner. These scenes are everyday, normal happenings that ground the show and provide it with a pleasant, relatable atmosphere.\n\nI'm happily surprised at how much better this anime has presented itself over how I thought it would go down. The inevitable drama (read from some of the synopsis stuff) seems as though it will get in the way of the sweet, budding romance we have now. And, yes, the CG (in another anime once again) isn't the best.\n\nHowever, given that this work is an original one and how well it is striking that normalcy, I'm more than willing to give it the benefit of the doubt at this point in time. :3\n\nEdit: Wording!"

The restaurant scene made me feel embarassed just watching those thwo since I would definitely not know how to act in front of a classmate I never talked to and my parents would just casually approach his/her family. \n\nIt's embarassing and awkward but it stays truer to life than most teen shows like this. Pretty good episode.

   "text": "So I was initially going to pass on this one as I haven't been feelig the romance vibe as of late... But the art style looked so interesting I wanted to give it a chance. I'm glad I did though.   \n\nSo it looks like a normal middle school/teenage love story but I am really enjoying the main girl, I believe her name was Akane. She's super nervous and shy but is able to socialize and is in the track team and such, so she's not a shut in, just someone who gets startled easily I guess.   \n\nShe's super cute. Her little plush that she squeezes when she's nervous is adorable too. I'm hoping that this story is told more on her end, or at the least a 50/50 split as I'm not sure how this is going to go if we focus on the guy so much.   \n\nThe art style is really nice. Everything looks *beautiful* and the characters all have a special kind of *glow* to them that brings them into focus more.   \n\nI don't know if LINE got a sponsored deal here or if its just like the Google thing, where at this point its just more realistic to use something a lot of people can relate to or not. I don't hate it, LINE is a cute texting app so it would make a lot of sense to use, I just thought it was cute.  \n\nSo I'm really looking forward to this one I think. Overall the first episode got the MC's to meet and technically exchange numbers, so I'm really excited to see how we go from here. I don't know if its going to be your cliche love story or not, but I'm happy to see a shy MC instead of the usual loud tsundere's and such.  See that she struggles with standing out or meeting new people was a nice refresher.    I guess at the end of it I can just say I liked it. I felt something nice and warm in this anime and I'm happy to see it through for now. It left me with a smile on my face. :)   \nthe OP and ED were nice and cute as well.  \nI like the characters, I like the world, I'm in. :)\n\n*Plus she's just so cute~*"

I wasn't too sure of a Romance set in middle school, but the setting and age of the characters actually made it more unique and endearing that it would've been in High School. The fact that the characters are just barely romantically self-aware makes it really cute to watch and the way it's presented makes it very breezy and simple. There isn't too much drama around it and it's more a comfy simple Romance series, which is really nice! In a season of isekai and action, it's nice to have stuff like this. I'm looking forward to seeing more! This pilot was really endearing.\n\nThe scene in the restaurant was really adorable. The boy getting iced coffee to seem mature was so sweet, and both of them being embarrassed by the parents making contact was so cute, I think we've all been at that age and had similar experiences. I love that this series is so simple and breezy rather than dramatic, and the great art and OST elevates that even more. I'm seeing AOTS material in this."

   "text": "This is easily my most favorite premiere by far this season. It's so damn cute! I really hope they don't take the love triangle too far, I just want this to be a beautiful coming-of-age romance, something that's quite rare these days since most romances are either a shoujo, where the MC is a normal looking girl and the guy is a bishie or it's a harem where the MC is a normal looking guy and he chooses someone from the thousands of potential best girls that are into him for no reason, this show has the advantage of being an Original and I really hope I'm not let down.\n\n\nI absolutely adored all those subtle moments, all the blushes and the awkward moments, the tension and the cuteness have such a perfect balance. The restaurant scene felt so real and unforced, sure it makes use of a coincidence but it turns into nothing more than a really heartwarming first meeting between the two.\n\n\nTiny subtleties like Kotaro buying that book at the end enhances the fact that he really doesn't know what he's feeling. Even Akane, according to her it's just nervousness but soon she'll end up understanding what love is and it'll be beautiful.\n\n\nI can endlessly sing praises about this anime, like even the tiny things such as Akane caring for Kotaro and dusting his shirt or in the ED how they slowly get closer as the seasons change and end up holding hands, everything is just so god damn beautiful, not to mention the OST and art which is gorgeous as well.\n\n\nLast but not the least, Kotaro x Akane is the first and only ship, she called him *Curly-kun* dammit, plus it's mutual, it's so goddamn perfect!\n\n\nEdit: Messed up the names"

Someone spent a lot of damn time and effort making that look gorgeous.\n\nMy main reservation about this show is that both leads are VERY shy, and very slow to act. Kotarou, in particular, can barely get a word out. Hopefully they get bolder as the show goes on or this could be a formula for frustration. They're middle schoolers, so I'll give them some time to figure stuff out, but I don't want to be waiting 10 episodes before any progress is made.\n\nI also really enjoyed the little shadow boxing match Kotarou had with his dangling light switch. I used to do that with my ceiling fan when I was growing up. So weird to see something like that animated."

   "text": "I was really looking forward to this and I'm glad that I really enjoyed it! It's been a while since I've seen such a cute and innocent high school show and it's pretty refreshing. It's got a very nice relaxing tone and atmosphere that's really enjoyable as it sets along on its comfortable, leisurely pace. The major two characters introduced so far, Akane and Kotarou, seem to be quite interesting, especially Akane and I'm looking forward to see more of their interactions and development as they inevitably fall for each other. The voice actors are doing a nice so far with some subtle touches that are nice and they've captured their characters quite well. Also I think Chiwa Saitou is voicing Akane's mom which is nice, Chiwa Saitou is always good with some great range: she can go from someone like Senjougahara to someone normal like a middle schooler's  mom, that's quite something ahah\n\nAside from the pretty jarring and unpleasant CGI for the background characters, I found it pretty nice aesthetically. The art style has this really airy and light feel that's really pleasant to look at. The characters being shiny with white outlines was something that I thought I wouldn't be a fan of but it's quite nice actually but in a sort of weird way. feel. has a lot of attention to detail, best shown in Oregairu S2 with its fluid animation and detailed facial expressions, and they've shown some of that here with the beautiful cherry blossoms in the beginning, some expressive gestures and the flying dust in the scene with the equipment room. It's well done and I hope it keeps up to balance out the CGI.\n\nThe OST was really light on the ears and pleasant and it fits the tone really well. The OP and ED are really nice and it's really great that Yuigahama's VA is singing them, she's got a wonderful voice. But all in all, a pretty great start that was super cute. It's got a lot of potential to be a normal, straight and simple romance and I hope it goes down that path. Only thing holding it back is the animation and the CGI although that's probably due to a lack of budget since this is an original that likely does not have a lot of funding. I'm really looking forward to the rest of this and I hope it delivers!"

But at least shows that it wants to be forward with it and not have the entire cour dedicated to holding hands as an ending. Wish it was more calming, then it would underline the awkwardness in a more poignant manner.\n\nI think this will make me read through Aku no Hana and Orange these months. It's not bad by any means, but I just don't see anything particularly promising or notable about it. A fluffy romance from top to bottom."

It's really down-to-earth, and yet it promises to move beyond lewd hand holding rather quickly. \n\nPure romances aren't normally my thing, but for this one I'll make an exception. "
