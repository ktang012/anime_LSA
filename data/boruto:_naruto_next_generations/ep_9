   "text": "I love how Boruto can lose a fight and casually accept the defeat knowing that he just wasn't as strong. I don't know if it's that I just finished a rewatch of Silver Spoon but seeing the class all on the same side wanting each other to improve is just so great to watch. \n\nShino has had to have had more screen time than all of Shippuden by now, and more development. Really like how they aren't just resting on the popular characters of Naruto, and allowing those who went under the radar a bit more time to shine.\n\nAnd on that note **BEST DAD IRUKA SENSEI IS THE PRINCIPLE**.\n\nFor those that didn't watch the end of Shippuden Iruka has a great arc in which he eventually becomes the surrogate father to Naruto for his wedding, it's really heartwarming, but within that arc was a moment of Kakashi asking him to be the principle (IIRC) which he had reservations about, so seeing him have taken the role it's just the cherry on a great arc.\n\n##THIS IS WHY I LOVE GENERATIONAL STORIES!"

Were it a bigger problem, he'd have likely told someone about it, but to him it's just a weird occurrence that happens every so often that he's able to deal with. It's likely that after the fight with Shino he's gonna tell someone, because the people this thing is possessing are getting stronger and stronger. Plus, the kid's like 8-12 years old. The fact that he even tried to talk to someone about it and can recognize his ability as similar to his mom's is pretty impressive, but he's still gonna make not rational choices about it.

I go by what the anime presents, and not by what people think the character is trying to say, but doesn't say because the writer didn't make them say it (or foreshadow).\n\nSure, 8-12 year old kids are stupid, but don't you know danger when you see one? Like, how many times does Boruto have to see that purple mist possess someone before he puts one and one together? It's already been 5 episodes, 5(?) characters have been possessed, and all 5(?) showed ill-will towards people. Are you saying a 8-12 year old kid can't recognize when someone or something is dangerous?"

Or any work of fiction for that matter. I don't need things to be spoonfed to me in terms of character motivation. It isn't like I'm trying to justify bad writing, I just prefer to consider something before writing it off as an inept author.\n\nBut on this specific topic, it makes complete sense. Boruto cannot activate his eye on command. He only ever sees this energy after it controls somebody. How can he properly explain this when he himself doesn't understand it? \n\nMoreover, you can't just dismiss his age when it's probably the most important factor as to why he doesn't go to someone about this. He's a prepubescent, hot-headed borderline brat that doesn't exactly respect any of the adults we've been introduced to so far. Why would he go to any of them for help when he's handled each and every occurrence of the fart gas so far? Are you trying to tell me that every single child you know or knew makes great choices that get no one hurt 100% of the time? Because in the world I live in, kids make dumb choices and do dumb things to and with each other that sometimes have terrible consequences. Plus, no one ever brings up how Naruto just plain stole a forbidden scroll from the village because some guy told him to do it. I find it easier to justify Boruto's dumb choices than Naruto's near constant idiocy.\n\nMy guess on the next 2 episodes is Boruto finally realizes that this is becoming a situation he cannot handle, and he tells somebody about his eye and the evil energy. Then someone will call him out for not saying something sooner, he'll give his reason, it might completely contradict mine, and you'll have your completely spelled out reasons for why things happened. Until then, you can say how much you would have done in Boruto's childish ninja shoes, but you aren't a child, and you aren't Boruto. "

It's still really early days to make that sort of conclusion, considering we've been teased that Konohagakure is going to lapse back into a war that will potentially destroy the ninja. \n\nI look forwards to developments, because seeing Boruto go from happy go lucky with a few petty issues to potentially lose almost everything he cares about is definitely going to be dark."
