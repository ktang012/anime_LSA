Hitler had a plan for an orbital space station that had sunlight-focusing mirrors on it to be used as a weapons platform. This was deemed impractical due to logistical issues and the state of rocketry at the time. With adequate energy supply, orbital structures are completely feasible even at megaproject scale.\n\n> You're also basically trying to turn the planet into a comet and I shouldn't need to explain to you why that would be a terrible idea\n\nA comet is a small celestial body with an irregular orbit that takes it from the fringes of a solar system to close vicinity of a star, and back. As its surface heats up, ice and assorted solidified gases evaporate, creating the comet's signature tail. Comets are not self-propelled and certainly don't have anything to guide their course.\n\n> Unlimited energy is not magic\n\nDepending on definition of \"magic\". If we consider it to be phenomena that can be observed and used but are not understood adequately by science, then unlimited energy as presented by a benevolent alien fits the bill, dependent on how much of the process needs to be understood in order to replicate its source.\n\n>  You can't just do whatever you want with it\n\nYou can't change basic universal constants, such as the speed of light or the Planck constant. Everything else is a matter of logistics. Give Archimedes a big enough lever and a point of leverage, and he'd move the Earth. Photonic rockets circumvent the Newtonian issue of \"mass needed to convert energy into momentum\" rather nicely: with an unlimited source of static energy, the mass emission may be imperceptibly small. This is assuming the EM Drive (a prospective form of seemingly reactionless drive that generates thrust in a vacuum from electricity by pushing against the background electromagnetic field of the universe) doesn't work, and it very well might."

So first he gives us unlimited energy, then he strips away from us the ability to sleep... in the end he wants a bunch of transcended humans that can leave this plane of existence and go chill with him in the anisotropic.\n\nCompound that with Shindo's mother saying that it's \"fun to drink with your children\" (in the context of zaShunina possibly being lonely). What if zaShunina really *is* a god? What if humanity *is* his children? Interesting possibilities here.\n\nShindo did not look particularly happy with the revelations that he has been changed by Kado and that he no longer needs to sleep. I wonder if he will continue going along with zaShunina's desires or if he will eventually discover a line he will not cross. How much can you change humanity before they are no longer human?

In this sense, accepting his offer to get out of the petri dish is necessary once we realize just how fragile our world is: any event on the scale of the macro-universe can destroy it in the blink of an eye.\n\nAs of humanity... well, even without benevolent aliens, technological progress -will- make humans inevitably need to change their definition of what a human is. Body can be replaced, substrate and scale may be changed. The key is ensuring the preservation of the self, and the self is a process.

That's a riot. Because a lot of things happen when you sleep, and it's not just resting your body. In babies, it is very very important that they get a lot of sleep. It is essential for the development of the human brain, making neuron connections, learning motor patterns, etc. And it is not limited to humans either, a lot of other species sleep too (and for similar purposes) Taking away sleep without disturbing the natural functioning of the human body would mean a total change in its biology.\n\n> Without NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, our ability to form declarative memories, like learning to associate pairs of words, is seriously impaired; deep sleep is important for transferring short-term memories into long-term storage. Deep sleep is also the time of peak growth hormone release in the body, which is important for cell reproduction and repair.\n\nSo, I guess, the next plan is to reconfigure or maybe reconstruct humanity's DNA. Imagine the backlash on this move.\n\n> Shindo : Dude, you're acting like my overly attached ex. First it's change this, change that. And now you're just trying to change my very being.

That \"sense of understanding\" is likely similar to a general idea of your objective. For example, you *could* draw a star line by line, but you are more likely to get something that looks right if you know what you want to obtain at the end."

   "text": "> did they actually confirm that Wam are higher dimensional objects?\n\nNot directly, but it was said in the anime that it is \"an anisotropically shaped hole\" from which energy comes out. But it most certainly has to exist in a higher dimension. Here is my theory on why a wam has \"infinite energy\" (inspired by *[this article](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/What_is_the_Fourth_Dimension%3F)*) :\n\nLet us take the case of Two dimensions first. Suppose a piece of paper to represent a plane. If it is infinitely extended in every direction, it will represent an infinite plane. Now, this infinite 2-D plane can be sliced into an infinite number of thin 1-D lines. So, you can say that an infinite 2 dimensional plane contains an infinite number of 1 dimensional lines.\n\nTake now the case of three dimensions. Conceive a solid of three dimensions. If this solid were to become infinite it would fill up the whole of three-dimensional space. This 3-D solid can be sliced into an infinite number of 2-D planes. So, you can say that an infinite 3 dimensional solid contains an infinite number of 2 dimensional planes.\n\nTake now the case of four dimensions. Instead of bringing before the mind a sheet of paper conceive a solid of three dimensions. If this solid were to become infinite it would fill up the whole of three-dimensional space. But it would not fill up the whole of four-dimensional space. It would be to four-dimensional space what an infinite plane is to three-dimensional space. There could be in four-dimensional space an infinite number of such solids, just as in three-dimensional space there could be an infinite number of infinite planes.\n\nSo, our \"seemingly\" infinite 3 dimensional universe might only occupy an infinitely thin slice in the 4 dimensional universe. And that 4-D universe can have an infinite number of those. So maybe even a little bit of \"4D space\" there has enough \"energy\" to sustain all of mankind for eternity. And a wam just acts as a 4-D \"portal\" (or an anisotropically shaped hole) which \"channels\" energy from the 4th dimension into the 3rd dimension."

His face and body language is more expressive (he now smiles properly!), his speech is more natural (still not quite, though), there's increasingly more emotion in his voice (just listen as he calls Shindou's name, it now ranges from casual to fond). In his own way he also seems to be striving to understand humans, it's just that the power balance tips toward him...\n\nOn that note, I wonder why they translated \"katte\" as \"selfish\". Yes, it means that as well and this meaning is present in the dialogue, but in this scene the point was \"if you keep doing as you please\" - which is exactly what Zashunina is doing, changing people without their knowledge, never mind consent! I think it was a pretty clear foreshadowing."

So the optimists will be satisfied and be happy that the world is so so wonderful and humanity is so so nice. Because the wonderful thing about faith in humanity is that other humans can tell you how wonderful the world is because you believe them, and because you believe them you believe the world is wonderful because you believe them and so choose to believe them more instead of bothering to properly check if they are spouting complete bullshit. So as long as you keep telling the optimists that the world is wonderful, they'll happily sit still and do nothing, letting you commit as much evil as you want in the darkness."

So Yes, the world isn't perfect but trying to change the negative and preserving the positive creates more difference than either side ever could. Humanity given infinite energy won't turn to child slavery nor would become a utopia but like the scientist in the Kado said about Wam, it's up to humanity to decide how it is used responsibly and even morally. In fact, the show is trying to address this very question for the right answer, it's even in the goddamn title. They are constantly thinking of a way to solve the moral dilemma exploiting people for their Wam like the UN did."

I mean think about it. That line of thought is basically telling you \"Hey! Kick back! Relax! Have a beer! Since nothing you do will change the consequences anyway, you can just go around doing whatever you want, whoopie!\" You really call this pessimism? All I see is thinly-veiled optimism. Same thing for the alleged \"pessimists\" who throw themselves off buildings. You really think it's so easy to escape the hell that is reality? \n\nTrue pessimism is the realization that every choice you make could ruin everything for everyone including yourself. Especially choosing to do nothing. Pessimism is the realization that there is no absolute worst, every situation can get even worse if you make bad choices. Pessimism is the belief that there's no right answer, but some answers are far far worse than others. \n\nPessimism is the understanding that given the right incentive, like infinite energy, there is no upper limit on the amount of evil humanity would (secretly) commit. Only then, would you start contemplating what actions you can take to make things less bad. And while yes, many pessimists may spend their entire lives contemplating and end up achieving nothing, or end up making bad choices anyway, at least they goddamn tried. "

Acknowledging that there's a problem is literally the first step in many problem solving guides, like steps for fixing an addiction. Because of course it is, if you don't think there's a problem, you wouldn't even take steps to fix it. \n\nFor example, you literally just said that your faith in humanity makes you believe they won't start making child slaves work in wam factories. Since you don't acknowledge that this is a problem that would occur, you wouldn't do anything about it. While the pessimists would be keeping their eyes open and scanning the increasing patterns of child disappearances for clues to find and stop kidnapping rings, the optimists would be all \"ooh they just ran away from home to elope, how romantic!\" or some other stupid happy reason.\n\nOptimists don't acknowledge that there are problems, therefore they don't fix anything.

For better or for worse, the way we approach the world influences the way the world appears to us. And once we\u2019re set in either a positive or a negative worldview, the way the world reacts to us is influenced, too.\n\nIt\u2019s a little thing called \u201cconfirmation bias\u201d: whatever lens you chose to see things through, it will show the evidence that supports your perspective. If you go into a day confident it\u2019s going to suck, you\u2019ll be more likely to see only the bad things that happen, thus making yourself more miserable and causing people to react to you differently than they would if you were in a good mood.
