   "text": "# **MANGA READERS: USE SPOILER TAGS.**\n## Please, for the love of all that's holy.\n\nReferencing *anything that is not the anime* requires a spoiler tag. Do not reference anything that has not happened in the anime, whether it's supposed to happen in the next episode, it happened between episodes and wasn't included in the adaptation, or anything of the same sort. We are *very strict* about enforcing this.\n\nApologies in advance if you're an anime-only watcher and your speculation post gets removed as \"reported for spoilers\" - this likely doesn't mean you've actually spoiled yourself with your analysis, but that we saw a report and just called it as a false-positive. If this happens, let us know and we'll sort it out as well as we can."

Studio WIT=still a small studio, so assembling staff/directors/animators is incredibly difficult to put together to get this type of talent/quality that is NEEDED for AOT\n\n3. All the other AOT hype that's been going on--think about the compilation movies (the Gurren Lagann ones killed Gainax as they took so long to make Studio Trigger was made)\n\n4. Kabaneri (with the same team as AOT) basically was a gold-mine hit in Japan for the show/merch and everything else that went with it, and it used the same team as AOT and Director Araki.  Basically we could have gotten this season a year earlier but Kabaneri was such a profitability for them it pushed this back.\n\n5. Studio WIT's schedule=jam-packed with upcoming highly hyped stuff like The Ancient Magus's bride and Kabaneri S2.\n\nAnd finally--the fact that it's the industry crap of how little budget/time they actually have to work with to make an incredible adaptation like this possible.  Even Game of Thrones, with it's $10 million/episode budget was basically cutting corners during Season 6 episodes to try to make ends meet to still make a return on investment.  Imagine if that's HB-freaking-O having problems with it, what does that mean for a small studio like Studio WIT in an industry ransacked with low pay-high costs-overworking and to make matters worse, all the pressure?\n\nIt's something where while I could complain about it (and I do think it was possible for them to do 2-cour but they chose to not overextend themselves like they did during Season 1) I've chosen to be happy to get such a great show out of it.\n\nLong as we see it all adapted....we might be watching one of the greatest anime ever being produced and need to appreciate that considering that 90% of the industry drops off after that one 2-cour season not to be seen again or ends up like Berserk."

I didn't think it looked as bad as last week.\n\n- Let\u2019s not forget the Armored Titan too. We all remember how clutch Annie\u2019s hardening was and Reiner has it over his entire body. Eren\u2019s Titan is basic as fuck in comparison\u2026which makes his comeback all the more badass!\n\n- This is the first moment of the series where I\u2019ve felt immense pride in Eren. He bested a superior opponent in combat and with a little help from Mikasa, had Reiner on the ropes. If only that broken Colossal didn\u2019t intervene\u2026\n\n- It's also ironic that Annie (and Reiner) pretty much taught Eren everything about combat. Remember he used her move on Jean early S1 and here, he used another one against Reiner. She\u2019s somehow the real MVP in all this.\n\nWelp, WIT has somehow managed to follow up last week in amazing fashion. Pretty sure I\u2019ll end up liking this season more than S1.\n\n"

The first and third time, plenty of people he knew, he'd watched die and channeled that anger after transforming; the fight with Annie, his internal monologue gets to the point of *eating someone*. I can't imagine that *not* having some sort of significance.\n\nI'm truly curious as fuck to how the manga handles it because the anime seems to follow it pretty well otherwise. Plus, the problem of retaining control seems to work well with Eren's personality as well, especially since Mikasa's first impression of his actions that first transformation was something along the lines of him appearing as the manifestation of humanity's rage.\n\nI dunno, I personally really like it, though I'm curious what the significance of it being different in the anime compared to the manga. Plus, I've read a few comments that state that the creator of the manga works along with the anime's production team and uses it to retell certain aspects of the story supposedly, so I'm especially curious about that."

   "text": "Yeah true, all in the eye of the beholder. I've helped a lot of people by being able to scrap. And for sureeee swimmers are strong af, no doubt. \n\nWhat you need to look for in a gym is multiple things. The most important thing to look out for in the beginning is how they treat their beginners. If you start out you should NOT be sparring or training hard with experts. I've heard a lot of horrorstories where they throw in beginners in with high level guys to \"test\" them. For the rest, do some research about the credentials etc. It's a good sign if they have a big pro/semi-pro team, but it's not needed. It's also a misconception that MMA/kickboxing/BJJ gyms are full of meathead machos. There are SOME, but if you see some overly alpha bro's, get the fuck outta there. \n\nFor BJJ i'd recommend a school where a black belt teaches, or AT LEAST a brown belt. Most Gracie affiliates are pretty good."

Sure all Bertholdt did was technically fall, but Reiner was able to position himself where he would take less damage and Eren would take most of it. Reiner armor is currently being broke, but still he will take less damage compared to Eren who is busy locking him down.\n\nAlso flashback showing Annie.

One thing I want to point out is that I think Eren's voice actor [Kaji Yuki](https://myanimelist.net/people/672/Yuki_Kaji) did a really excellent job in this episode. The intense rage and disgust dripping from his voice really helped make the scene. It's not just animation and music that make moments epic."

Like how the characters have to endure some sort of painful experience before they can control their giant thingies, and how they control it \"manually\". Come to think of it, G Gundam gives the humanoid form of the gundams a logical purpose.\n\nI can imagine Eren screaming \"Shining Finger!\" when attempting to land a hit on the enemy's face. I also can't wait for Eren's version of the Shining Gundam's \"Shining Finger Sword!\" 'cause we all know sword=best weapon. Why can't Hanji/Armin use their brains to make that a reality, like equip titan Eren with a huge 3dmg? She was probably blushing in this episode 'cause she was imagining Eren with a sword. I wish Annie did something better than crystal fingertips, and made a crystal sword instead (or even just crystal throwing knives or shuriken.)"

We're going to call this person Eve, and I believe her to be the first Titan-Shifter.\")\n\nAlso [Spoil](/s \"Eve \\hiding the length of this spoiler\") supports breast cancer awareness, as shown by the trademark ribbon [Spoil](/s \"to her right.\")\n\n---\n\n[2](http://i.imgur.com/ZVWiVtg.jpg) - [Spoil](/s \"Bam!

It's easier to see the rest of the 8 and 5 start to fade in when the shot is in motion.\")\n\n---\n\n[5](http://i.imgur.com/XqfhIxp.jpg) - [Spoil](/s \"Eve's reign comes to an end when she dies for whatever reason. Pictured here are Eve's husband and her three children, two boys (left, mid) and a girl (right) -- remember that -- surrounded by a bunch of mourners. The children appear to be consuming her flesh. Some kind of weird ritual? Perhaps to transfer her power to them? Either way, I think they end up inheriting her powers and go on to either continue ruling this kingdom or splinter off and create their own Titan kingdoms.\")\n\nI couldn't get a clean stitch, sorry. The image jerks around and fades near the edges and the credits are baked in.\n\n---\n\n[6A](http://i.imgur.com/kovxoqK.jpg) - More flashes of the strange ancient writing.\n\n[6B](http://i.imgur.com/CiUxbQc.jpg) - Some random black entity, I can't figure out how it's relevant.\n\n---\n\n[7](http://i.imgur.com/RqUZkqM.mp4) (Mobile warning - it's a gfy) - [Spoil](/s \"Eve's children go on to somehow mass-produce dumb titans, a breed distinct from the Titan-Shifters, and use them to conquer territory, spread their influence, or otherwise subdue huge numbers of people, murdering thousands in the process.\")\n\n---\n\n[8](http://i.imgur.com/xYjdeI6.jpg) - [Spoil](/s \"Depicted here are some very large, muscular Titans of extremely similar height and build that go on to become the walls Maria, Rose, and Sina (supported by the following set of several images). Make note of the direction they travel: West - toward the sunset (or East toward the sunrise, but given how pervasive the German influence is and how not-Asian everything is, I find that unlikely)\").\n\n[Spoil](/s \"I speculate that a rebel faction within Eve's empire discovered, inherited, or otherwise attained the ability to make Titans and created these very specialized models who can use their crystallization ability to form the walls in preparation for a future event: the Great Exile\").\n\n---\n\n[9A](http://i.imgur.com/pAeRJs6.jpg) - Between the previous shot and the next one proper are some very rapid images of the three wall emblems and flashes of members of the Church of the Wall.\n\n[Comparison shot with the actual logos](http://i.imgur.com/l3zwF6J.jpg) | [Enhanced contrast](http://i.imgur.com/9X556en.jpg)\n---|---\n\n[9B](http://i.imgur.com/I0JIbSH.jpg) - A gathering of the Church of the Wall.

They travel, again, West toward the sunset (or East toward the sunrise) -- the very same direction that the large maybe-Wall-Titans traveled earlier. This, I think, is the founding population of what is initially presumed by us viewers to be the \"last remnants of humanity\"\").\n\n[10B](http://i.imgur.com/0AMf9TB.jpg) - [Spoil](/s \"Quick shots of foliage and calm skies indicate that the settling was successful\").\n\n[10C](http://i.imgur.com/S6StGuh.jpg) - More calm.\n\n---\n\n[11A](http://i.imgur.com/sLakSef.jpg) - [Spoil](/s \"A shot of the desert between Eve's kingdom and the bastion of humanity?\")\n\n[11B](http://i.imgur.com/Hl8OHYx.jpg) - And now it's crawling with Titans, seemingly emerging from the ground.

This (poor-quality) stitch of the ending pan depicts the family tree of the original royal line of Titan-Shifters. Eve is standing atop a staircase gesturing proudly with a rallying horn in hand, her three children (two boys and a girl again) kneel below her in reverence to their mother, and Eve's further five grandchildren kneel below them. A throng of humans collectively bow to them all as servants to masters. Eve is overlaid by a large X, likely referencing the fact that she's dead. The insidious implication here is that the other royal Titan-Shifters are still alive and well\").\n\n---\n\n**In summary:** [Spoil](/s \"Long ago in a galaxy far, far away there existed a kingdom or series of kingdoms ruled by powerful Titan-Shifters, all descended from a single unbroken lineage. They rule their kingdoms and conduct wars using Titans as their weapons and humans as their sheep.  Our band of humans escaped or were exiled and took refuge in a Titan-based bastion created by the Church of the Wall, and are only now under final siege from soldiers of Eve's kingdom, or some factional descendant thereof.\")\n\n**Speculation**: [Spoil](/s \"Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and Ymir are from this old world, the former three tasked now with destroying the rest of human-ruled humanity and Ymir driven by unknown motives. Somehow, someway, Eren also acquired the power to Titan-Shift which is interesting because, in line with the above, that power is limited to royal blood from the old kingdom(s). Does that mean that Eren has some connection to this ancient line? And what about our other Titan-Shifters, Ymir and the traitorous three? Will we ever get to see what lies in Eren's goddamn basement? Find out next time on Dragonball Z.\")\n\n**Bonus:** Hey look it's [ED2](https://gfycat.com/ReadyLiquidHound). We see part of our main cast hanging out just chillin': Eren and Mikasa looking cool, Armin and Potato doing their thing, Jean yelling at Connie...and look who's on the *other side of the wall* when the camera flips. :O"

I honestly lost track of the episode, time-wise, and the ending got me hard.\n\nSo much stuff happened in this episode yet it didn't feel overloaded with too much content. \n\n1.  Mikasa subconsciously inability to follow through will killing both Reiner and Bertholdt.  She's been a bit of an Ice Queen the entire series but this somewhat humanizes her a bit.  \n\n2.  It's the fucking awesome mat wrestling display by Eren.  It's one of those things that would seem better animated than on paper and it was adapted pretty well.  \n\n3.  It was the CG used for the Colossal Titan.  Most of the time it feels jarring and totally out of place but here it wasn't that bad.  \n\n4.  Mikasa vs. Annie and the guys yelling at each other saying who they think would win sounds like what we do on this sub.   Totally had a boner at that confrontation.\n\nOverall, this carried on the momentum pretty well from last week.  My only concern down the future at the end of the series is where they park it.  They look like they're going to end this current season on a high note if pacing works out the way I think it is.  Then if they have mercy and give us another season, where I think they'll pick up could be really rough and difficult to get through."

Tough world they grow up in\n\n* Fanservice moment! Mikasa vs Annie! Everyone knows it too\n\n* Reiner's question of 'what do you think, Eren' would be 'is this human better than a shifter?'\n\n* That's genuinely awesome from Eren, using the hand to hand fighting techniques the shifters taught him\n\n* I love how Eren is in control of himself and everyone is calm around him, where they can stand on his shoulders and talk to him\n\n* That the first time a \"titan\" has ever responded to Hanji?\n\n* Mikasa just memed. 'Haiyai'\n\n* Opinion reinforced at how much I like background characters getting involved\n\n* THE SUSPENSE IS TOO HIGH\n\n* Eaten by Bert? Dun dun dun!\n\n___________________________________________________________________________\nRein and Bert are rusty. When's the last time they shifted?

There are like three hundred and fifty different dog breeds, after all. Sure, you can just call them all \"dogs\", but there's a distinct difference between a bulldog and a great dane, for instance, and it's significant enough that it's worth identifying them as being separate breeds.\n\nSame applies for MMA. There ARE a lot of different techniques, but just saying \"there's so many of them, so why make up names for all of them, that's so silly\" makes no sense to me. Of course they have different names, they're different techniques. For someone studying MMA, there's a distinct and important difference between an armbar from guard and a triangle from guard, and when trying to communicate the technique, then it's easier when it's given a specific name. What's the alternative? Not name anything and just let people guess what you're trying to talk about?"

Maybe it's better to just spar and then people can organically learn which moves they can make depending on what position they find themselves in.\n\nBut you're right It would be hard to describe a fight if there are no names for all the moves you make.\n\nBut still I remember someone describing some combination and he used a a japanese name and my reaction was like really, couldn't you just describe the fight in some other way instead of reciting some jargon. It's hard to listen to descriptions of fights if you're not a fighter but I guess it's not meant for guys like me to listen to all that commentary that really dives deep into it all."

   "text": "It's the same thing with dog breeds. I'm sure you don't know what every possible dog breed is, but if I wanted to describe my dog to you, I'd tell you he's he's half Australian Cattle Dog and half Rottweiler. \n\nNow, unless you're some sort of dog expert, you probably don't know exactly how these breeds are defined. And of course, even if you were, no two dogs are identically similar, so it's not like you could know exactly what he looks like. Even so, you've probably seen those breeds before, and at least know off the top of your head some characteristics of both breeds you recognize. But ultimately, both of those breeds are just a \"combination\" of characteristics that make up said breed. You probably know, for example, that Rottweilers tend to be very thick, and that Australian Cattle Dogs have pointy ears. Of course, other dog breeds can be thick too and have pointy ears, but the \"combination\" of characteristics that make up both breeds are distinct enough and unique enough that there's value in giving them a name distinct from other breeds.\n\nNow, because you know what two breeds my dog is, you probably already have a very good idea of what he looks like. And it was very easy for me to get this idea across to you, but only because I had words that described combinations of characteristics that you could use to form a picture in your head. \n\nThe difference is, you don't understand what any of these MMA words mean, and so to you they're nondescriptive and confusing. But for a person like me who recognizes most techniques, it becomes very easy to have a fight described to me when someone says \"Here the guy in guard is attempting Triangle, but the other guy is framing\", I get immediately what's going on. No two techniques are ever executed exactly the same way in every possible situation, but even so, I get a great idea of what's going on because I know what those things are."

I guess she must have been subconsciously holding back against here friends.\n\nWhat's wrong with [this picture](http://i.imgur.com/MbmjzlG.png)? Ah yes, Mikasa being a moron. How about chopping a couple feet to your right, maybe?  Or is the bright red muscle showing in gaps between the yellowish armor an anime-only thing?  The Titanphiliac later mentioned armor gaps like it was some ingenious revelation instead of something everybody with eyes should be able to see at a glance.\n\nWhen did Eren learn stay in control of the Titan Form instead of just giving it the initial order? I don't remember, was he in control during the Annie fight?\n\nWhy do they think Eren getting away would be a victory? Those two will just keep breaking walls/gates, destroying the rest of humanity, forcing Eren to come to them anyway.\n\nMost importantly, why is the episode only 5 minutes long??"
