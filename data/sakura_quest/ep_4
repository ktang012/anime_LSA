   "text": "This is why I love this show.\n\nNo big loud melodrama, it's quiet, subtle and relatable.\n\nThis episode is a really accurate portrayal of what it's like growing up as a shy introvert with social anxiety. Almost uncomfortably so.\n\nYou can't help feeling like there must be something wrong with you. Groups exhaust you, people all around you seem to have energy and confidence without trying and expect you to be the same, but it doesn't work like that. People are different, some people are shy and extroverts (i.e. they're shy, but 'get their energy back' by being around other people), some people are shy and introverts (i.e. they get their energy back on their own). And if you're a shy introvert with social anxiety, it's so easy to feel cut off from other people.\n\nIt was only after becoming an adult that I realised that was ok. \n\nNot everyone is an extrovert, not everyone 'gives off energy' to other people. Some of us are quieter, and need time and space in order to feel comfortable. And even though we might sometimes need time to ourselves, or be away from a group, that doesn't mean we don't like people. It doesn't mean we don't want to spend time with others.\n\nBut sometimes when we try, and it tires us out, and we have to leave early or we feel unable to participate, it ends up making us feel more lonely than if we hadn\u2019t been there at all. And that's why Riri leaves rather than watching them dance; seeing that will only make her feel more isolated and that there's something wrong because she doesn't want to do the dance. Sometimes we need time alone, but that doesn't mean we want to be lonely. That's why I stopped going to big parties and stuff. It was too loud, there were too many people, it made me feel uncomfortable, and even if I was having fun I got exhausted and had to leave so I could calm down and just breathe. It was horrid, I didn't enjoy it at all. But I was a first year uni student and everyone was doing exactly that and seemed to be enjoying it, so it must have been something wrong with me, right? Well, no.\n\nI don't like big parties, I prefer to spend time with friends more personally. No strangers around, no big noise, no crowds, just us having dinner, or watching a movie, or chatting, or cuddling, or working, or doing anything. I don't want big birthday parties, or Christmas parties, I want something small and quiet where I can spend time with those handful of people who I love as family.\n\nI enjoy that so much more than big parties, and whereas the big crowds make me feel isolated and lonely, those closer-knit groups make me feel at home and comfortable, and confident. I don't feel even remotely alone, because I'm not.\n\nAnd I may be projecting here, but to my eyes, Ririko's the same.\n\nThe classrooms and large groups made her feel isolated, the expectations and demands of others (smile, dance, be happy, be an extrovert) made her feel alienated, and her discomfort with those things has made her feel that there's something wrong with her. Ad then Shiori says that she's changing and she's happier, but she doesn't feel like anything has changed, she doesn't feel any happier; she's more comfortable in that smaller group, but still not speaking much, still unsure, and hasn't realised that's ok. She feels, like I felt, that because she's different from those around her, there must be something wrong with her. \n\nHer home situation isn't helping any. She's an adult now but she doesn't have independence, she's not being allowed to spend time with the others and make up her own mind. I was also the same, and it was after I became more independent that I started figuring out what I needed. Tbh she needs to move out and gain more control over her own life, thinking about it, moving in to the log cabin might be just what she needs. Whether she does or not, she will have to become more assertive and independent in her home life. Calling it now!\n\nAnd I reckon that over the course of this show (beginning from the next episode) she's going to realise that she isn't 'wrong'. That there isn't something wrong with her, she's just *her*. And what she needs to feel safe and happy isn't necessarily the same as what everyone else needs. There's nothing sad about it, finding out what you need to feel happy is a good thing.\n\nWhat they're doing with Ririko here is a very mature and calm representation of how that feels. It\u2019s silent and it affects every aspect of your life. And I know how it feels.\n\nAnd I have never seen a show handle a theme like this in such a simple, understated, and accurate way. It's totally realistic.\n\nCuriously I also remember not being bothered much by rain too, it felt soothing somehow. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with shy people, everyone\u2019s just different, and it can take a lot of time (and meeting the right people) to learn that and to feel happier.

   "text": "This perfectly explains the experience and feelings that introverts go through. I've always been shy as a kid but I've learned at a young age how to essentially force myself to be more outgoing in certain situations, not just out of fear of being seen as the odd man out but out of personal responsibility, too. Just this week, I've had to moderate several panels for a conference as a favor to the organizers, who have helped me out over the years. Earlier this year, I also did a storytelling session in front of a theater audience for work and spoke at a large gathering in front of hundreds of guests honoring my grandmother. Folks commended me on those occasions for being a \"natural\" at public speaking but what I don't tell people is that it takes a tremendous amount of effort because I still get quite nervous and experience anxiety when talking in front of people. But it's something I understand that I need to learn to deal with whether it be for my job or family. It's just that some introverts deal with it better than others and I think it's important not to force or judge folks who may not be as comfortable with it. For the most part, I've seen people be quite understanding, provided they realize what's going on."

Which I admire..\n\nIn America I acted exactly like Riri when I was in elementary school. I often sat down in a corner by myself away from people.. What I got was scolded by the teachers with \"can't play well with others\" being told to my parents and bullied by the other kids. Luckily my parents didn't bother me about what the teacher's said, I think they got mad at the teacher's actually..\n\nAlso luckily I was a big kid who had above average athleticism, so physical bullying didn't work on me. But they grew smarter and resorted to using the teachers to get me in trouble.. When several kids make the same claim against 1 kid, the teacher believes the several kids.. \n\nThis is a big reason I wish I was raised in Japan, and if I have kids I'd prefer them to be raised in Japan.. Though I'm white so I'd be worried about them being bullied for not being Japanese."

At some point in my life I learned to deal with people and strangers without coming off as a jerk and learned to hold conversations better, but I'm still mostly uncomfortable when dealing with situations like this. In a sense, it is a skill I picked up to avoid further attention by carefully navigating through it. Some people are weird, but as long as it isn't hurting anyone else, it is fine to be weird. Well, I tell that to others, but I also have problems actually staying true to that myself."

And Sakura Quest, although have a start with the same principle has Hanasaku Iroha, the main theme of the show is how to revitalize a little country without losing it's tradition while being interesting to tourists.\n\nOn my count, Shirobako does it's job superbly well, a must watch if you like this genre. Seconded by Sakura Quest (thank god they're avoiding romance in this, it just isn't right for the purpose of the show) and last but not least, Hanasaku Iroha makes a very good job on developing the MC and the people around her, but the romance drama kind change things and I was looking for a different direction on that part, but that just me. Good shows, slightly different in their core direction, with powerful characters interecting with each other."

The panic/hectic elements overlap with their schedule (it's hard to have major time based conflicts/problems at the start of a production). \n\nFor a slice of life show about how anime is made you end up quite emotional invested in that crew at the end of it (and not just the five friends). \n\nI can't remember if Ema's cubicle neighbour (Shigeru Sugie) is already introduced by this point but he and the whole animation department slowly get a nice spotlight upgrade and the show focuses a bit less on the production management of things and starts to include more details about the rest of the production (art, audio, research, writing, \u2026). I feel that's when the show grows into itself and shows its soul. "

Some people also came in expecting Shirobako: Rural edition (I'm a guilty party member). SQ does a lot of things well (i.e. giving equal time to all the girls), but the reason I don't like it as much (still find it an ejoyable show) as Shirobako is that it feels too sitcom-y to me. When it shows the girls struggling and getting dumpstered by real life is when I think the show is at its best. Shiori has shown fantastic growth in her arc, which I really enjoyed, but I'm still not a fan of everything being so easily resolved. I'm not against nor do I hate optimistic shows, it just feels a bit silly when SQ does it. This is just my personal preference and opinion. I have it at a strong 7, weak 8 as well. "

SQ is much more light hearted while still having drama aspects which will be much more appealing to many people. I personally really enjoy harsh truths of reality. Though that could just be because I'm a dude in his early 30's and life is hard man haha. I like drama, but natural drama (if that makes sense) none of that forced crap. An example of forced drama is in currently airing show Re:Creators. Surprisingly enough I actually enjoyed the show quite a bit, until Megane showed up. Naturally flowing drama of just life being life is wonderful and great. But drama being forced through purposeful misunderstandings, etc. Bleck. She singlehandedly almost made me want to drop the show haha. Praise Jeebus for Meteroa. \n\nAnyways my point is we have different tastes and I completely understand why someone would prefer SQ!

It is truly fantastic.\n\nI'm sure you and I have very different upbringings and experiences in life so I'm sure that plays a huge factor in what we see as pessimistic and grounded. For example in terms of sadness of a show I (and probably unfairly) compare everything to season 4 of The Wire, which is still one of the most soul crushing things I have ever experienced. \n\nI definitely find most of SQ as comedy and light hearted. BUT at the same time it does have the harsh truths and realities of life sprinkled in. Therefore I can see why this show would be more appealing to some people. Yes they have problems and obstacles, but it all seems to be worked out smoothly and quickly. Which unfortunately doesn't happen in real life, most of the time. One thing I will agree with you on is your statement on handling mediocrity. I can see how for several of the girls learning to accept that their big dreams just aren't happening is a nice dose of reality. But again I'm not here to say your thoughts and opinions are wrong. Just that I see things differently. Funnily enough, I actually like Barakamon much more than SQ (up to this point) despite it being more light hearted and optimistic. But like I said above we have different experiences and tastes, hell I could be completely overselling Shirobako. You may think it's actually much happier or a much worse show, and that is fine. Still hope you give it a shot. Truly rewarding show. Anyways hope you have a wonderful day!"

   "text": "Despite not being a pure comedy, this anime constantly makes me chuckle. Interactions between characters are hilarious and feel somewhat natural - chemistry is definitely there, and that \"rural romance\" tour was pretty funny - especially how the men tried to hit on women. \n\nAnyway, looks like Ririko's arc is now. She always seemed like a reserved and timid person (even though blunt at times) who was mostly interested in her own hobbies. That being said, no one can live outside of society, and Shiori still considers her as a friend. Ririko seems to struggle with returning these feelings and feeling out of place within the group. I don't really want her to change that much - as Chitose said, she's fine as she is - but have nothing against her getting a little bit more comfortable around her friends. "

I think the show wants to show that sometimes we have issues dealing with feelings or desires we are not used to. In this case, I feel like Riri's conflicted because although she hated learning the dance as a kid because it was about tradition and forced her to smile, she _still_ wants to learn it with her newly made friends. She's battling her past self and its convictions. "

   "text": "**Ep 10: The Dragon's Soft Spot**: This week's meaning has  been explained pretty superficially by Kadota. You know, it does on one hand make reference to the tale of the Water Dragon that disliked cheer, but on the other hand it serves to explain Ririko's actual situation. Her behaviour until now has always followed the same pattern: She endures a difficult personal and family situation and in spite of that she's been capable of doing lots of things and proved she is a valuable member of the squad. But she never changes her serious and obtuse expression and soft, timid voice, as a signal of her internal disarray. This week's topic has apparently made her unstable pillars tremble: the sole mention of dancing made her uncomfortable and needy of putting everything away for saving herself. Thus, her \"soft spot\" that made her show her weakness is the same that brings on the rage of the dragon. Her capable self has been crushed by something that is supposed to be cheerful.\n\nAnd so Ririko arc has arrived! Let's see how it develops. I don't like to see her sad... Feels so familiar. A big part of the charm of this lovely show is how relatable everything is, and this time it hit me right on the guts. Low self-esteem, uncertainty, insecurities, complexes. I'd love to hug [her] (http://i.imgur.com/eRffAIh.png) and tell her how I dealt with all of these at the wee small hours of my late teens if it could help.\n\nBesides, we got an extra big ration of Sandal-san today. [You can never have enough of him!] (http://i.imgur.com/s29lYEe.png)\n"

Nice episode, and I'd love to see what that ending was about."

I know because that's how my folks have raised me, so now I'm the quietest guy in the office and proud of it. :) OK, not as bad as Riri, but my point stands.\n\nThe matchmaking event would probably be less cringey if the Tourism Board would insist at least five ladies came instead of just three, which is too awkwardly small a number to start any meaningful conversation with the various guys at the Single Men's Association.\n\nThat last scene with a weird bearded guy emerging out of the water (?) followed by Riri taking shelter from the rain in a bus stop just seems like an unusual place to end the episode.\n\n^^^~~I've_seen_enough_hentai_to_see_where_this_is_going......~~"
