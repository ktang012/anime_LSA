   "text": "I'll back him up here with my own experience. I'm not a manga reader. It's just never been my thing. I'm not even that big of an anime fan, just somewhat of one. I find a new anime once every few months or so that I end up falling in love with but I definitely don't watch anime very regularly. I'm actually fairly picky about getting into a new anime. A friend tried to get me to watch Food Wars but I just didn't really enjoy it.\n\nThis is the first time I've gone from watching an anime to reading the manga. All other cases I've been able to wait. Even ones I really, really like such as One Punch Man. I'm patiently waiting for season 2 instead. I really enjoyed Attack on Titan but I wasn't so obsessed with it that I needed to go read the manga. I was able to wait.\n\nI couldn't wait for this series. I started this anime less than a week ago, caught up in 2 days, waited a day, and then started reading the manga. I'm almost caught up to the manga now. At first, I had the same apprehension. Do I really want to know everything that's going to happen? Thankfully, I gave in and started reading it. \n\nAnd it's done nothing but blow me away. The illustrations and style are so incredibly well done, I very rarely have a hard time understanding the context of a panel. The action scenes flow together so well between each panel that I'm able to imagine it animated in my head. And all I can think about when it's time to watch a new episode (so far today's episode is the first one I've seen after having read the manga) is how excited I am to see how they animated this scene or that scene.\n\nOne thing I really enjoyed was the way the camera focused and zoomed in on Deku and Shinsou as they were walking to the arena. Small touches like that really add to the scene in a way the manga cannot. In the manga, it just shows the two of them from a lower camera perspective. \n\nLastly, I can't wait to see the upcoming fights. I know how they play out, generally speaking, but the anime tends to flesh them out far more than the manga could (without using an entire volume on a single fight at least). In the manga, you have to do a lot of mental imaging to understand what happened between each panel. But in the anime, you get to see it all fluidly unfold. I'll use a fake example. \n\nLet's say in the manga someone gets knocked back and they bounce off the floor a few times before hitting the wall and collapsing on the ground. You'd probably get 2-3 panels about this. 1 panel showing the impact that knocked him back, another panel with a line bouncing off the ground showing his trajectory with him hitting the wall, and a third panel showing him collapsed on the ground. Remember, again, this is a fake scenario. I'm not saying this happens. In the anime, though, something like this would show you each and every brutal bounce off the ground as the character goes flying. By the time they hit the wall you already feel *horrible* about what just happened to this poor person and you understand what kind of pain he must be in.\n\nSo that's why, even though I've read quite far into the manga, I'm still excited to watch each episode. I may know the story but I still thoroughly enjoy watching everything play out in smooth, crisp animation."

   "text": "Sorry for the late response, but adaptation pacing is weird. The rule of thumb is 2 chapters = 1 episode, but as you can tell that ends up being a bit slow. It's a bit more like 2.5 chapters = 1 episode, with variance depending on the amount of dialogue and type of action. A well paced adaptation requires some creativity for all the cliff hangers to connect effectively and all the events to follow the manga's presentation. If you want a recent anime that actually managed this transition well, you can compare Demi-chan manga to the anime adaptation from last season. In that show, they fill the phantom 0.5 chapter time with either stuff from other chapters or anime original content that flows so naturally you wouldn't notice it's anime original.\n\nBasically, they chose the safe ratio when story boarding MHA to make all the end of chapter cliffhangers line up without serious deviation from Horikoshi's presentation. This ends up with sub-optimal pacing, but overall I'm satisfied with the product. Primarily because they're doing a great job with everything else. It also helps that I'm used to big name shonen adaptations butchering the pacing much worse than this."

There needs to be a journey and they should definitely be the underdog so there is tension in battles and the character has a chance to develop in terms of strength or will. It has to have progression. Dragon ball is a good example. \n\nDeku is a bit like a shounen hero but he is also a subversion of a western superhero archetype. By making him one of the only ordinary people in the world (born quirkless), he becomes the most extraordinary, especially when he gains an fantastic power after spending his whole life with the mindset of being powerless and not fitting in with a quirk filled world of heroes and villains. His character flaw of underestimating himself and lacking in self-respect also has the benefit of keeping him humble and could lead him to be an incorruptible beacon of justice. So, superman but with the character development to become a hero akin to superman, instead of the golden age comic concept of the penultimate hero being born having perfect qualities."

But at the end of the day, YOU'RE the one doing those things. No amount of emotional abuse can force you to harm another innocent person; it's not like being forced under direct threats to perform a specific action.\n\nhis mother could have taken several different actions to not scar her child: she could have left (again, not the greatest option, but infinitely better than boiling your child's face.). She could have called for help from anyone at any point. for god's sake her husband is an international superstar; she could have filmed a day in her life and released it on youtube to swiftly turn the public against him and gain control of her life.\n\nyou cannot blame her for ending up in a bad frame of mind after years of abuse, but for the harm she committed against her child, only she can be blamed.\n\nAlso; if that shit happened in any real life first world country, the judgement would be the same. Mother would most certainly be found guilty of assault."

A lot lighter than others in terms of action, but very stacked in terms of dialogue and character exploration. The conversation between Midoriya and Todoroki was pretty great (and funny). It's a shame to see Ojiro concede, as he has one of my favorite quirks in the series, but since we're getting two new ones in return it should be great.\n\nJust for reference, I believe all duels were mentioned except Kaminari vs Green-haired girl.

There's so much potential for her to surprise the fairly one-dimensional quirk of Tokoyami and take the match. If she knew about his weakness then she could probably create a magnifying glass or something to strengthen the sunlight, but since she doesn't then I think it'll be a closer match. \n\nNo matter who wins it should be one of the most interesting first round matches (alongside Kacchan vs Uraraka)."

The biggest rival will win the finals in the end, and it's not going to be Bakugo for reasons before mentioned.\n\n* In terms of the others, it's just based on general character importance and power level. Class A will win most of their matchups (apart from Kaminari, because he's not strong nor important), and when it's Class A vs Class A it'll just be whoever is the more important character. Which is why for example I think Tokoyami will beat Momo."

Ilda coming out on top would actually make an amazing foil to the expected plot progression.

They'd also have to find something for Deku to DO while the rest of the tournament happens, but I guess that could be mitigated if he's the last quarterfinal match since there's only 3 after that. That said, I think you're probably right on this one, and that's only partially because I want to see Todoroki stick it to his old man.\n\nSimilarly, Bakugo losing BEFORE the final to Tokoyami would give him character development. I mean, they've been building up his concern that he can't win against Todoroki, but to have him lose before getting there would be devastating for him. It also makes that matchup have more plot relevance, although we would also get that if they use the match to give exposition about Tokoyami throughout.\n\nI also wouldn't be surprised to see a non-standard result or judge decision at some point, just to shake things up.\n\nProbably the more interesting question here is whether Todoroki can make it through to the end without using Fire. I hope yes, but I also hope he comes to terms with the fact that letting his father define his sense of self is just playing into his hands."

And, since it's his reason for existing in the first place, it's going to obviously have a huge impact on his view of the world.    \n- All Might can't have a family because of the danger they would be in as well as the possible risk of harming his reputation. This is why it would have to be a \"secret love\" child.   \n- All Might is really caring for Deku (he mentioned this in the episode).   \n- He's seen just how similar his ability is to All Might's firsthand.   \n- The public doesn't know about how One for All is passed on, as evidenced by how Deku didn't know (and he's obsessed with heroes, especially All Might). In fact, they probably don't know of any abilities that are passed on in a way other than inheriting. "

That's a super interesting power, a 1HKO that breaks your appendages if you use it. It creates some actual risk around using the move, there's some limitations. But so far Deku has used it several times without injuring himself, which basically just turns him into One Punch Man without any of the self-awareness. Plus it's only gonna get worse as the show goes on and he becomes comfortable when using it. I had hoped using the power without injury would be something that happened at the climax of the show, when deku finally came to terms with his power, because anything after that would be a farce in terms of there being anything at stake.
