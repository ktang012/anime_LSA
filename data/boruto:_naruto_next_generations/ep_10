Speaking of the school school, why the hell are the special animal summoning scrolls together with the normal ones?  Boruto is like 10 and he already made a blood contract with some freaky manticore type of shit under the teachers' noses.  Sure Naruto did it around the same age but at least it was under Jiraiya's supervision.  Really man.  What're they doing there!?\n\nAside from that, fuck yeah for purple girl with no name for getting the win.  Also I fucking love Sarada being the big badass boss bitch.  Easily best girl after the initial Boruto movie."

And is told once you defeat a god you cease to be a normal human being. If this is after I guess it makes sense, but judging by how him and naruto communicate I'd say it's before. Also what ever happend to Yamato?? He literally, and I do mean literally, disappeared as soon as he was freed from the ninja war. "
