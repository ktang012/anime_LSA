   "text": "The show is about a shrine maiden living in a small town with this talking bear. She wishes to get more independent so she can move out of Nowhere, Japan and into the big city. However, she is deadly afraid of city people due to something one of the people who kind of acted as her guardians said to her when she was a kid. She also suffers from some kind of social anxiety and has problems speaking to anyone but like three different people who she trusts, one of those being the talking bear she grew up with. The anime shows her progress of trying to get over these issues through getting her first job and such, eventually culiminating in her visiting the big city in the last few episodes to do some sort of performance there. Due to the view she was given of city people when she was a kid, however, she's constantly misinterpreting any interaction as hostile, eventually halucinating that the city people were throwing rocks at her when they were actually cheering her on, which traumatized her. Now, this misunderstanding would've been perfectly easy to clear up by any one of those three people in life that she trusted, but over the last couple of episodes they had decided they didn't like the idea of the bird leaving the nest, took a complete 180 on their attitude of trying to help her out, and decided to reaffirm her trauma and encouraging her to stop thinking for herself so they could keep her around like some sort of pet. The series end with her having regressed to the state of a five year old, while the happy opening music plays over it.  \n[](#nico-heart)"

There was no encounter with looters, no exploring the hidden base of witches (IIRC), nor an old man dying after ~~forcing~~ entrusting a heavy duty to Albus.\n\n\nThis, and the 2nd episode, make me think they're trying to pad the season so they can end it at a certain point.\n\n\nDon't dismiss 13 so easily though. He just hasn't had enough time to shine yet.\n\n\nI am looking forward to the next episode. Lots of questions will be answered, and probably a lot of people here will be left very angry with what happens. Unless they stretch it out as well."

And the part where Zero patiently guides Mercenary through the forced summoning, I think, was a sweet but very subtle showcase of the growing trust between them. \n\nOverall, I think that while the episode as a whole wasn't *that* bad, it's definitely the weakest one thus far. Regardless, I'm still really looking forward to seeing how they handle the rest of this arc. I loved the way it was handled in the Light Novel so hopefully they do it justice. "
