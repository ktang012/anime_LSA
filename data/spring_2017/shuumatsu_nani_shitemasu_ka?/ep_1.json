   "text": "I read about the song Scarborough Fair after listening to the official CD release today. Apparently Scarborough Fair is a song originally about a guy asking the girl who wishes to be with him to do impossible tasks such as \"Tell her to make me a cambric shirt\" \"Without no seams nor needlework\", which is impossible. Its basically saying that all these tasks were impossible to complete in the first place, hence the girl will never be with the guy. \n\nHOWEVER, whats even more mindblowing is that Yamada Tamaru in her SukaSuka rendition of the song switched out the \"her\" parts with \"his\", thus suggesting that Willem who wishes to be with the one he loves, Chtholly, will never achieve it. The promises they make with each other, which can be substituted with the tasks in the song, are impossible, and thus they will never be with each other.\n\nFun fact: \"In Medieval times, the herbs mentioned in the song represented virtues that were important to the lyrics. Parsley was comfort, Sage was strength, Rosemary was love, and Thyme was courage.\" Thus you can start to piece together how the song depicts Willem's and Chtholly's struggles, their qualities, and their story as she rushes towards the battlefield to her death.\n\nGod damn, I cried again when I rewatched the final episode today and noticing the song intertwining with their promises with one another."

   "text": "Yes,  I agree with your point. But analysing a novel and giving honest critique on it is not something we see often. What I often see in r/anime is the phrase \"another isekai trash getting an anime adaptation\", even before the anime airs. This is bad behaviour in my opinion. Isekai is not even a genre,  it is a setting which authors use to set up the world building etc. An isekai can be magic/sword battle,  or school life or even sci-fi. It is just a starting point. Anyway,  I am getting a bit off-topic here,  but what I am trying to say is that we have no right to judge something we haven't read and absolutely no right to dismiss a whole genre/setting just because of one novel/anime. \n\nIn my opinion if something is good enough for getting picked up by a publisher for publication,  it means it is decent. No publisher would risk publishing something that won't sell. Although there are web novels with bad writing,  most of them don't become a light novel(meaning they don't get published). There are light novels with bad writing as well but I am sure they have some redeeming parts which convinces people to buy them. Also using an anime as an example when talking about a light novel is not a good idea either. Anime adaptations of light novels are rarely accurate or faithful to their source material. \n\n> If most of us agree that a certain novel has numerous flaws with evidence, then I would deem it quite safe to say that it is poorly written.\n\nI absolutely agree with this but most of the times our judgement becomes clouded after investing so much time reading something. Maybe a light novel went a way we didn't want it to,  or maybe because \"best girl\" didn't win. Being completely objective is impossible."

Quality doesn't always align with enjoyment. Now I'm pretty sure everyone has their own guilty pleasure, and I definitely *don't* want to seem like an elitist prick who looks down upon anything not universally regarded as a classic; but we can't rely on the publishers for quality assurances - they publish whatever the consumers want. That might very well be quality novels, but it can also be yet another piece with bland characters, unnecessary broken English names and poorly executed  clich\u00e9s. We surely can enjoy whatever LN we like, but spending at least a little time to assess its quality would never hurt.\n\nThis is getting seriously off topic.

I'm thinking of Clannad After Story, Your Lie in April, and Elfen Leid.\n\nThe other observation is that regardless of KonoSuba's overall merit or its fanservice, it do a lot of things right from a technical storytelling perspective.

   "text": "Okay, so this technically was NOT an anime original ending, though the timeline of events WAS messed with a little bit. Keep in mind we're still only halfway through the series (volume 5 is really thick).\n\nWhile I would of course recommend reading the light novels for everyone interested in the continuation, I will provide some spoilers for those who are curious about a few things. Note that some of these spoilers I'm about to give cover events that happen past what the translated parts of the novels cover.\n\nOnce again, the below spoilers are MASSIVE. Even if you have read the entirety of the English translated LN, you will still be spoiled by reading these.\n\n[Q. That baby with blue hair at the end, was that Kutori?](/s \"That was Riel, who is very strongly implied to be a reincarnation of Kutori. She appears at the end of volume 5 as a young girl about 8-10 years old, but is still an infant during the events of the sequel series SukaMoka. She does NOT inherit Kutori's memories, but is believed to be a reincarnation of the same soul as Kutori.\")\n\n[Q. What happened to Villem and Nefren?](/s \"They are both still alive. Villem and Nefren both become trapped in an artificially created past of the surface world 526 years ago, and the two of them go on some grand adventures reliving the last days of humanity.\")\n\n[Q. And what of Villem's fate specifically?](/s \"After they witness the downfall of humanity, Villem and Nefren are returned to the real world as half-beasts. Villem has most of his memories sealed away in order to maintain his humanity whilst Nefren doesn't really suffer many ill effects. After befriending Elk, and of course not knowing who she is, Villem is required to stop a ploy by the military to utilise leprechauns as living, soulless, mindless weapons. In doing this, he regains his memories and allows himself to be killed by Rakishu (the now-wielder of Senioris) before turning completely into the \"first\" beast. Nils, Villem's past teacher 526 years ago, turns out to be a god and offers Villem to become a god also, and to accompany him on his travels through the stars. Villem turns this down and prefers to die instead, but then comes back to life about 10 years later and meets Riel, much to Naigraat's disbelief.\")\n\n[Q. So what exactly happened 526 years ago with humans and the beasts?](/s \"A rogue faction called True World hatched a plan to return the world to its \"true and original form\" which is basically a desolate wasteland with beasts roaming its surface. Humans were originally created from the 17 beasts, having been given emotion and wisdom from the gods long ago. The beasts yearn to return to their old home, how riddled with foreign buildings, plants, and life. As more and more humans are born, the souls poured into the humans to turn them from beasts into humans runs thin -- like a balloon being filled with too much water. This bubble will soon burst if nothing is done. True World is broken up into two factions, and the second faction aims to stop this from happening. Nils, Villem and Lillia's master --\n and a god -- , is a part of this faction. This second faction plans to use Elk's soul and distribute it among the humans in order to create more balloon, so to speak, for the humans to grow into and thus preventing it from bursting. Alas, they fail, and the humans ultimately revert to their original beast forms one by one except for Villem who \"dies\" and Swan who also \"dies\" in order to escape this fate.\")\n\nAny other questions, feel free to ask me."

She couldn\u2019t even feel a sense of loss.\n\n> The girl got the feeling that she wanted the man to smile. She wanted him to laugh and tease her. But at the same time, she wanted him to cry. She wanted him to feel for her now empty self so much that he would be moved to tears. I\u2019m a terrible person, the girl thought. *I really am.*\n\n> The young man\u2019s eyes opened ever so slightly and looked towards the girl. A sudden happiness welled up inside her chest. She could convey to him. After losing everything, even losing sight of who she was, one last wish still remained inside her tattered heart. There were words she wanted convey to him before she disappeared for good.\n\n> *Thank you.*\n\n> She moved her lips to form those words, then, with every ounce of strength left inside her broken body, she smiled.\n\n> After a brief moment, the girl\u2019s consciousness terminated, never to return again. \n\n[Spoilers](/s \"Ctholly is 100% dead.

Looking forward to the original ending as well as picking up the EX volume and SukaMoka when they are translated.  \n\nAs a side note, I feel that despite the series not being that popular, it's been gaining major success in some ways nevertheless. With it originally estimated to end at volume 2, it now has 5 volumes (6 with EX) in addition to the ongoing 4 volumes of SukaMoka.  \n\nThis has definitely been my favorite series this season, for both the story and OST.\nI'm assuming that the ending is original, but I wonder how much they altered?

   "text": "Honestly, I feel like the anime was a rather good adaptation as it covers most things and the ending was pretty much as-is to Volume 3's ending. Stuff it cut mostly relates to Vol. 4 & 5's contents so it was reasonable. Anyway, here's what I found interesting in the changes:  \n\n[Volume 1](/s \"Ending excerpt mentions the first of the 17 beast types, Chantre, howling towards the moonlight. Since beasts can only understand their own kind's language and Chantre is the sole beast of its kind, its howl reaches and touches nobody. It's revealed that the howling meant \".....pa.....pa.....\" \")\n  \n[Volume 2](/s \"Apparently there wasn't any information on the battle as it's not possible to bring in nor out information due to barrier magecrafts to secure the battlegrounds. Chtholly's soul breakdown began during the battle, and she figured out Ithea is a different person during it when she tells Chtolly of her knowledge on the entire breakdown process to stop her from finishing the fight [Chtolly explicitly calls Ithea \"senpai\" despite her being physically older than Ithea.]\")  \n\n[Volume 3](/s \"Willem is confused as to why they found the certain dug weapon in that area, as it was the weapon of a fellow Quasi-Brave called Navrutri(?) who operated far away and disliked the Empire's territory. Willem uses magic to save Nephren and falls down like in the anime, but without Chtholly's protection - Chtholly went down a bit afterwards. Chtholly kills all 715 beasts in the vicinity and her consciousness finally fades away. The scene cuts to the new blue-haired fairy being born. \")  \n\n[Vol. 3 end ties directly to Vol. 4](/s \"Willem is woken up by Almaria in the orphanage, as if everything 500 years later was just a dream. However, he finds Nephren with him; things aren't making sense, but tears fall down his face nevertheless.\")  \n\nThere are more characters/factions introduced/explained in Vol. 4 & 5, but it does end on a similar fashion  \n[hint:] (/s \"tragedy never ends\")."

Though the side characters left a bit to be desired, some episodes in the second half weren't great, and the ending is quite strange, I'd give this a solid 8. Chtholly and Willem were excellent characters by themselves and even better together, the lore isn't fully explained but still fascinating, the soundtrack was **GOD-TIER**, and it was just a nice, emotional show that never went over-the-top. One of the best anime of the year for sure. "

   "text": "When I first saw this show, I brushed it off entirely because it looked like \"just another generic show.\" Oh, how could I ever be so wrong.\n\nAfter a while, my friends finally convinced me to try it, and after the very first episode, I was immediately hooked. This show is in so many ways everything I want from a show. Good characters, intriguing world, great soundtracks, all of it was there. This show does so many things right, and was such a refreshing show to see. It reminded me immediately of what makes anime so good, the ability to make anything, go anywhere, or do anything. This is the kind of show you could only experience through anime.\n\nSo what exactly didn't I like about it? I really am disappointed to see how this show didn't get a full adaption, it really deserved it. I felt like at times the show slowed down unnecessarily just to make the final climax get pushed back to the very final moment. Was it worth it in the end? YES.\n\nWillem by far was the most refreshing character from this show, as we slowly started to see what made him push on and continue to live, it was so mysterious and at the same time what kept me watching. The entire mystery behind this world and the secrets behind it is what easily made this such an easy watch to keep coming back every week.\n\nThe Soundtracks for this show were equally as beautiful, the version of Scarborough Fair with this show was nothing short of beautiful. All of the soundtracks set the tone for this show so well and did exactly what it needed to.\n\nIn the end, my overall review for it is a **9/10**. The ending was somewhat vague and left out some stuff from the LN that would help make sense of what went on. I really hope we get another season to fully adapt Volumes 4-5 in the future, I would love to see more of this show."

   "text": "Willem's appearance untold during a dramatic ending like this, so I believe he survived. However, it should just let him die already. What exactly has he done to deserve this suffering. All he ever wanted to do was to fight to be of help to people. Let him die so he can finally rest, he doesn't deserve this at all.\n\n\nThis anime touches on plenty of thoughts I have (albeit extremely pessimistic). Willem sees himself without talent, so he trained with sheer hard work, and wanted to be of help to people. Yet, for all he has done, he has never once saved anyone in his mind. He thought he was fighting beasts all along to only realize they were his people. After all this time, he has failed to save the person who meant everything. All of the tiny little happiness he gains ends with disappointment. It might be because of just my pessimistic views and depression, this leads me to thinking if everything ends with disappointment and sadness, then happiness isn't worth it if it ends in heartbreak. This also touches on people being heavy handed, and just selfish. Isn't that what people are? Just absolutely selfish beings. Even those who seemingly does good for others and have good intentions on the surface level, don't they do it just because they can't accept it otherwise? This is something I have thought of, that the actions I've been doing. I thought I was being of help to people, because I care for them and want good things to be happening to them. Who am I to care though? It is just me unable to accept otherwise, and in the very end, it is just my selfish emotions.\n\n\nNow to the ending with the pool and rebirth if Ctholly I'd like to believe, what does that mean? A parallel world or is it in the world like the one Elq was in? I don't know anything as there isn't enough information."

I think it is a great start towards understanding your own nature. I'll share my own experience with you, in hopes that maybe it will help you.\n\nTowards the end of the second semester of college, I was plagued by a similar thought. My problem with life was - \"Why be good?\"\n\nI was depressed because this question tore me apart, and the only answer I could find was either \"Because all people are inherently good\" or \"Because if you don't be good, you'll be punished for it by an authority. Either God or life or karma or whatever\". No matter how much I probed into my past experiences I couldn't find the first statement to be true. Everyone I had ever seen, including myself, was moved by a selfish desire. And most people do good acts either because they are trying to gain something (good karma, a place in heaven, or to procure a favor), or they were brought up that way, told stories about Warriors, Saints, sons of Gods and hermits, and told to be like them. I was brought up that way too. I remember, when I was little, when my parents would tell me those stories or when I'll watch cartoons on TV, and they would all say something like this : \n\n> Now listen. You are a good person. And you must do good deeds because that's what good people do. Not because they're told to, but because they are a good person deep down.\n\nSo, there I was, sitting alone in my room, staring at my ugly disgusting self, blaming myself for being motivated by selfish desires. \"What do you mean you're in college for your family, for your parents, so you could provide them with a better life? Aren't you just trying to secure your own future. Taking money from them, something they worked so hard for, for your own personal good, and thinking that you are doing it for them, that you care, aren't you ashamed?\"\n\nI didn't get out of my room for days, didn't attend class, didn't call back home, because I just couldn't bring myself to face people. The ideal that I had built, of a person I thought I was, a genuinely good, loving and caring person, was staring at me, telling me \"Look. This is who you are. Who you really are.\"\n\nI kept beating myself up. Thinking, looking back as far as I could, I couldn't find it, \"When did I become like this?\", \"What made me this way?\", \"What is wrong with me?\". I just couldn't find an answer.\n\nSo I started looking outside, maybe there were people who were plagued by a similar thought. I stumbled upon Viktor Frankl's logotherepy. Reading his book \"Man's searching for meaning\" taught me the importance of a purpose and love and the subjective nature of good and bad. But that question was still staring at me - \"Why be good?\" and \"How can I be a genuinely loving person?\".\n\nMy pursuit then lead me to Zen, and the ideas of Alan Watts. And he answered my question. Going back to that statement :\n\n> Now listen. You are a good person. And you must do good deeds because that's what good people do. Not because they're told to, but because they are a good person deep down.\n\nHe points out the absurd nature of that idea, of being a *genuinely* loving person. Because what that says is - \"You're required to behave a certain way, which, would only be acceptable if done voluntarily.\"    \nWhat a paradox! And I was carrying that paradox within me, and built the whole idea of who I was around it.\n\nHe further points towards the absurdity of doing \"good\" things by this short story :\n\n> \"Kindly let me help you or you'll drown\", said the monkey, putting the fish safely up a tree.\n\nand points out that\n\n> Sometimes doing good to others, and to even doing good to oneself, is amazing destructive. Because it is full of conceit. How do you know what is good for other people? How do you know what's good for you? If you say, you want to improve, then you ought to know what's good for you. But obviously you don't. Because if you did, you would be improved.\n\nSo, in the end, the question you should ask, is- \"What is *wrong* with being selfish?\", \"What is good, really?\", \"Why do you want to be a genuinely loving person?\"    \nTrying to be unselfish is trying to make a move, which, puts yourself out of your own control, into the control of a better. Which is impossible to do. Because it is always deliberate as long as you are trying to do it, hence selfish.\n\nThe way to get around it, is to accept who you are, whatever or whoever it is, and accept that you were never in control to begin with. Because you don't even know who you are. You know what you *think* you are. But you can never know who you *really* are. Because problem of trying to know oneself is like trying to smell your own nose. And just like a knife can't cut itself, or a fire can't burn itself, man can't know himself.\n\nSo, the questions I was beating myself over - \"Why be good?\" or \"How to be a genuinely loving person?\", were absurd questions to begin with.\n\nZen and ideas of Alan Watts have really helped me over the past 4 years, and I still keep getting surprised by the them. Try looking there, maybe it will help you with your turmoil and pull you out of depression.\n\n***\n\nSorry for the long post, I hope it wasn't too preachy."

The depression came from multiple sources, as it usually is for most people, since everything piles up and it could just be one straw that breaks everything down. I also understand a lot of the things said, but again it is contradictory to me. I tell the people who I care for to be themselves and disregard everything else. My reason for wanting to help them was, just because I don't see myself deserving happiness for the shitty person I have always been, and also this pessimistic view, extremely hating disappointment that has happened over and over again. There isn't disappointment or despair if there wasn't hope in the first place was what I came up with. There was a time where I thought I was just being selfless, because all I wanted to be was see the very people I care for be happy. Turns out I was never who I thought I was, and that thought just adds up to one of the factors of an identity crisis. I think about humanity in plenty of ways, and honestly, I always look at the bad side and I've forgotten how to look at the good side of people in quite a long time, except if it is fictional.

   "text": "> I always look at the bad side and I've forgotten how to look at the good side of people in quite a long time\n\nThat right there, is the bane of your psyche. The idea that, in this world, exist two opposing entities of good and bad, that they are always in conflict. And in order to not let the bad side win, you must fervently devote yourself to being good. Shun the bad side, lock it and throw it into the deep sea.\n\nThere is nothing good, or bad. There are no bad people, or good people. No bad feelings, or good feelings. No bad things, no good things. And so on.\n\nGood and bad is a way of filtering reality for the purposes of survival. It is a good servant, but a bad master. The problem isn't that you're looking at the bad side, it is that you think there are sides.\n\nYour statement,\n\n> There isn't disappointment or despair if there wasn't hope in the first place\n\nworks both ways. Just as there is disappointment because there is hope, there is hope because there is disappointment. And if you look at it, it doesn't mean anything. It is a senseless statement. And you are beating yourself over it. Try to look beyond it. There is nothing wrong with being disappointed, or hopeful, happy or depressed. There is no problem with being the way you are.\n\nWatts puts it in a brilliant way :\n\n> The mystic sees everybody around him looking dreadfully serious, looking as if they had a problem, looking as if the act of living were extremely difficult. But from his standpoint - the person's who had this experience - he feels that they look funny, that they don't understand that there isn't any problem at all. He has seen, from where he stands, that the meaning of being alive is just being alive. That is to say, I look at the colour of your hair and the shape of your eyebrow, and I understand that that is the point. That's what we're all here for. And it's so plain, it's so obvious and so simple, and yet here is everybody rushing around in a great panic, as if it were necessary for them to achieve something beyond all that. And the funny thing is that they're not quite sure what it is, but they are devilishly intent upon it; after that 'thing'. And so to the person in that state of consciousness, which I call mystical, that all seems very weird, very absurd. But it's not something that you criticise in an unkindly way. You don't say: 'Those damn fools! Those idiots!' You say: 'It's such a pity that they don't see it.' Because, although they are going around in this wildly ignorant pursuit, one of the funny things about it is that they don't realise that there is a dimension, a sense, in which their pursuit is magnificent."

Its a cautionary tale about self-destructive human nature and how easy it is to lose your humanity and lose sight of the value of lives being shed away. \n\nHumans were destroying the planet, so Visitors tried to stop them. Humans destroyed Visitors. Humans destroyed humans, becoming plague upon the land. And yet even with the entire species gone, the nature of war lives in Leprechauns, the closest thing to a human, being expendable weapons, bound to either die in a fight or go mad when they start remember the eldritch abomination that is the source of their souls. \n\nWillem knew that, Willem realized that and Willem tried to instill value of life to the children he had to take care of, even if, yet again, disregarding his own well-being. I guess in a way he succeeded with Ctholly. \n\nIn the end Ctholly's death is kind of a positive note - she did not die to fuel a war, she did not die because she was expendable. She died protecting those she cares about and sure we might never know if it was pointless or if she succeeded at it, but she died FOR something, she leveraged her own well-being to save lives and thus she truly lived. The cycle of war and destruction and death might continue and nothing might change but the fact that Ctholly did not live in vain will remain. Even \"weapons meant to explode, kill and die\" can find a meaning in life beyond war, which IMO is a clear thematic connection to how the core idea behind nuclear power can be used either to destroy(nukes) or to create(power plants, etc). In both cases, nothing might change but there's hope that it could. \n\nWe can only hope that something will change eventually, just like we can only hope that Ctholly did not die in vain and that Nephren and Willem survived. Will we know for sure? It all depends on if we get another season. Let's hope. "

One guy had asked to the LN author about it - he just commented that he can't tell anything unofficial.\n\nQ: I want to see season 2! What we can do?\n\nA: 2 things you can do.\n\n1, Buy BD/DVD as soon as possible. Me? I already booked 3 complete boxes of BD.\n\n2, If you want to have the 2nd season but not for buying BD/DVD, still you can help - send feedback to : https://twitter.com/sukasuka_anime\n\nQ: I love the music/songs during the show. OST?\n\nA: OST will be released in 7/12. https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B06Y5SY754\n\nQ: How many volumes are the LN?\n\nA: Sukasuka 5 volumes + 1 extra episode (Sukasuka EX). The anime is now end of Sukasuka vol.3. And there is a sequel, called Sukamoka.\n\nQ: Is there English translation of LN? (about: Sukasuka vol1-5)\n\nA: No official release. One guy asked to the LN author but he told he doesn't have any authority to determine it. It's depends on Kadokawa (publisher). One thing you can do is to send an e-mail to tell you want to. The fun translation is close to the end of Sukasuka vol.5. People recommend to read the PDF/EPUB rather than the html to avoid spoiler.\n\nQ: The LN EX and Sukamoka will be translated?\n\nA: Depends on Kadokawa (LN publisher). Fun translation is yet.\n\nFor more questions, please refer my FAQ : https://redd.it/6jmoog\n"

   "text": "Welp, at last, we came full circle.\n\nI must say, for an anime adaptation of a LN, this is one of the ones that came out the best. It isn't the best, but when you compare it to others, this one is pretty, pretty good.\n\nFor me, personally, the story didn't managed to grab me that hard, and of course I didn't care that much for Chtholly and Willem, but I can appreciate that some work went into crafting this LN into the anime medium, with all the thing that tied together constructed a narrative that told its story using all the departments. I can really appreciate this and I must say, now, in the end, that the music was a really nice choice for this show. It really reflects the story themes and atmosphere, although I must say that that is more by the melody than the lyrics, at least in my case.\n\nOf course, the adaptation run against quite some problems, from the setting, to everything related to it, you can see the parts that are glaringly lacking. Some you have to search for them, but in others it is so noticeable that it can't help but decrease the value of the experience. I didn't have much issue with them though, and I think it is safely to say that this was the best consistent experience of the season, for me, after Shingeki no Bahamut: Virgin Soul.\n\nAll that being said... I can't overlook one thing and one thing only, and I think it is something that, if you think about it, it could be even a plothole or unnatural convenience for the story to go the way the author wanted, and I think that no amount of context in the LNs can make sense of this little detail that, for me, even works against the story that is centered around the characters: I can't buy, some episodes ago, that once freaking Willem got the Lapidemsibilus he oh so wanted to get to save Chtholly from her degeneration, he didn't went straight to work on the sword so Chtholly could use it right away, and instead works on Desperatio. I mean, c'mon! no amount of detail and context can justify him doing something so out of character, especially with him proposing to Chtholly just afterwards. That sadly just took me out of the experience by a lot, in a moment where the relationship was losing its grip on me. \n\nLooking at the show overall, for me, I would say this is a 7.5/10, being just over LWA that has 7/10. SukaSuka just ended in the doorway to greatness, but without entering, and I can safely say that I will remember this show for a long time, albeit only in those few moments where it truly shines, and, of course, for the interesting lore it has, although the lore is something more related to the LNs than the anime. \n\nP.D.: So, the official translation is \"The Chanteuse\". Interesting. For those who doesn't know what I'm talking about, read the LNs :P"

I loved this one and i really hope they do more because its such an interesting world.  The characters were all amazing and the visuals were gorgeous, it was really a thing of beauty.  \n\nSo shit went to hell as we knew it would, and i guess Ren died, we dont exactly know since Willem is MIA too, so ide guess he managed to save her since Cthully looked like she pulled the red out of her eyes.  So we can only hope.  \n\nSeeing Willem essentially go berserk this last ep was everything i hoped it would be.  Seeing him dealing with his past and fighting his fellow humans was crushing.  \"Im sorry ive forgotten your name...\" as he crushes all the baddies.  And his flashbacks of his past.  It was also nice everyone got to see just how much of a badass he was.  \"what did you do...?\"  \"I used to be a brave...\"  i bet that changed her opinion on humans, seeing one go so far to save them.  And that Nephren rescue was so good.  grabbed her from falling, but she let go, so proceeded to ninja his way through the sky, killing the monsters and catching her, then was going to use some super move to save her at the cost of his life, but Cthully got to them in time.  Very well done scene.  \n\nThen that Cthully goodbye scene with Scarborough Fair playing... i could feel my soul dieing as that went on...  Willem had to watch as the person he cared about most in this new world, died and he was once again unable to save them... man i feel bad for him... i hope he doesnt turn to stone again...  \n\nMan this show... so damn good.  I could go on and on about it...  i need more... but my heart cant take anymore..."

Maybe the effort to license and translate is pretty high so a US publisher might not gamble on a finite series that, at most, can only sell 5 books per customer.  Granted, there's the sequel series still ongoing, but even that's only 3 volumes deep at the moment, bringing the grand total to 8.\n\nLN English releases seem to be spotty at best.  Looks like we only get things with _huge_ amounts of hype and mass appeal like Re:Zero and NGNL and/or series that are ongoing long-runners \nlike Spice & Wolf and Devil is a Part-Timer.

As you can wiki it, Scarborough Fair is a song about a guy who asked his former love to perform impossible task. While the depiction of the former love in this episode isn't that accurate, but I think it wants to show that Willem's & Chtholly's promises to each other has been an impossible task from the start.\n\nAnyway time to cry myself to sleep."

They are there to indicate that that segment of the song is a dream of love that is impossible to be fulfilled.\n\nIf you listen carefully, the other half of the song that intrudes partway through and takes over more and more is a song about the subject being in a war.  The subject is presumably a soldier reminiscing about a love that he'll never see again as he is facing his impending death in battle.  The impossibilities there to illustrate how much of an dream his love is.\n\nEdit:  Err, that's the S&G version.  I don't know if the original folk song had that half of it.

Did Ctholly die or not? Why did she come back to say Thank you to Willheim and did not actually explode? How is Nephren also dead, didn't Ctholly took away her red eyes or something?, and does that mean Wilheim is also dead? And who the hell is that blue haired kid? SO Ctholly is reborn?

They needed to fragment another Visitor's soul and distribute it to keep the humans from reverting back into beasts. This is why Lilia killed Elq, the last Visitor. However, the procedure didn't work. A couple of humans reverted back into beasts. Any other humans in their presence were effected by it and turned into beasts as well. Almaria, the orphanage girl in the flashback, turned into the First Beast, or the Shiantor. The Shiantor is capable of creating a very realistic dreamworld. Willem and Nephren are pulled into the dreamworld. They are aware the world isn't real, since they were last laying in each other's arms on the brink of death, and they spend Volume 4 trying to figure out how to get out. The dreamworld takes place in the last days before the Beasts appear. Willem learns a lot more about the circumstances leading up to their appearance and ends up witnessing it. Willem 'kills' the Shiantor in the dreamworld, and the essence of the Shiantor invades both his and Nephren's bodies. They get turned into half-Beasts, but retain their human forms.

   "text": "Some thoughts about the end of the episode.\n\nThere were 3 ends in Sukasuka LN. \n1st, it ends once by vol.2 (anime episode 6) because of low sales, i.e. it is forced to cancel the series. The LN author told Vol.1 and Vol.2 (anime episode1-6) are the \u201cbeautiful story\u201d. So the end of Vol.2 finished beautifully, and happy end.\nHowever, because of high reputation and voices from the audiences, it revives and the story continues - that is Vol.3. The LN author says Vol.3 is the \u201cbeginning of not-a-beautiful story\u201d. And he finished the Chtholly\u2019s story by the Vol.3 (anime episode7-12) to focusing on the episode which foreshadowed in Vol1-3. So this is the 2nd end and we see this end. The 3rd end is end of the LN Vol.5.\n\n\nPeople says it should be 24 episodes rather than 12 episodes for full adaptations to vol.5, yes I\u2019m 400% agree with that opinion and the LN author should think so. However, it is too much risky for the publisher to do that with seeing the number of the selling of the LN. And then probably the LN author determined to focus on \"Chtholly's story\" in 12 episodes. So, if the sales goes high from today, the 2nd season might be considered. \n\n\nThe anime adaptation skips most of the Lillia\u2019s and old days story in LN vol.1-3, and combine with the Vol.4 and 5, it is enough to have one cinema adaptation, or OVA,  or one more season. \n\n\nThe sequel, Sukamoka is not finished yet. \nA baby who looks like baby Chtholly appears in the cover of Sukamoka Vol.4. https://www.amazon.co.jp/\u7d42\u672b\u306a\u306b\u3057\u3066\u307e\u3059\u304b-\u3082\u3046\u4e00\u5ea6\u3060\u3051-\u4f1a\u3048\u307e\u3059\u304b-04-\u89d2\u5ddd\u30b9\u30cb\u30fc\u30ab\u30fc\u6587\u5eab-\u67af\u91ce/dp/4041046572/\nWe might see more reveal about Sukasuka in the end of Sukamoka but who knows.\n\n\nI\u2019ve got BD vol.1 today. https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B06XSG4K8T/\nAnd the BD vol.6 which includes episode 12 will be released in November. There could be a chance that additional scene is added which tells more about what happened in the end."

For more detail I posted this: https://redd.it/6l21kr\n\n\nAbout the baby that looked like Chtholly at the very end of the episode - it was intentionally depicted ambiguous - could be either of the reincarnation of her (end of the LN vol.5) or the flashback of her birth (end of the LN vol.3)\n\nHowever, considering that the LN author told that the anime is concluded by that scene, and the anime is independent story(!!!!) from the LN, it might be a flashback."

I could also have done without some of the bland romcom stuff.\n\nOn the plus side, Willem and Chtolly had decent chemistry and I also liked Nygglatho and Ithea were great. The OST especially in this episode was superb, Scarborough Fair will never be the same for me.  Solid 7/10. "

So  Neph is dead, Chtholly is reborn, and Willem is missing? \n\nWait if Chtholly was revived shouldn't Neph too since they're both faries? Does this mean Neph is still alive or did they just not show her? AAAAAAHHHh! So many questions! What the shit! The LN definitely needs a full adaptation. I might just buy the Japanese ones if that helps in funding a follow up season.\n\nAnyway, the show went the way I expected but it still did a good job of keeping me interested. SukaSuka made me care about the characters and the lore that I really want more. \n\nMusic is beautiful, who would've thought that the version of Scarborough Fair that I fell in love with is from an anime? The animation isn't really that special but whenever Chtholly (or any of the faries) spreads their wings the explosion of colour is just beautiful. I'm giving this one a 9/10."

   "text": "did we get any explanation on that huge 'people transforming into monsters' plot point? red hair kid is pretty important in the plot too.\n\nTo summerize: Ancient guy who had super powers or something gets 'frozen' somehow and awakens in the future where monsters have destroyed earth and weird races now live on floating islands with humans being extinct. In order to fight the monsters weird fairy spirit zombies are created which can wield the ancient weapons used by old guy to fight...the same monsters? Old guy becomes caretaker of loli weapons of mass destruction. Little kids suffer a lot and old guy bonds with them. He falls in love with a 15 year old. They go to the surface of the earth to go to an ancient temple or something. The girls when they reach their expiration date sort of...have their memories and souls decay and die or something. Blue hair 15 year old hottie clings on for unusually long because her original spirit was a little girl who was also a monster or something and got killed by one of old guy's comrades or something. Then the anime sort of ends with no real conclusion. Then there is also weird old guy who appears in 1 episode and for 1.5 seconds in the op who also somehow managed to survive for a long time (was it 500 years? clearly a realistic amount of time for busty dog-people to evolve) who knows something about how humans turned into monsters or whatever."

   "text": "They explained the old guy was a comrade of Willem, and used some curse to extend his life. But I agree that the ending just left me with so many questions.  \n\nWhat happened to Ctholly? First she comes back from the \"dream world\" to fight and is still on her feet even though she was stabbed like 15 times by huge tentacles and then even exploded?!  \n\nIs Nephren alive? Ctholly seemed to have purged the Venenum (eyes going from red to natural colour) but then we saw her portrait on the wall, meaning she died?  \n\nWhat about Willem? Nobody even talks about him after the fight and he sure wasn't in a great condition.  \n\nWhat about the two ripples in the water that the old guy was looking for? Two people alive out of the three that were fighting on the ground I guess, but no indication who it might be.  \n\nAnd that last scene where we see Chtolly as a baby with two young ladies, I can guess they are fairies. But at first I thought it meant she was reborn, but after reading the comments it's supposed to be a flashback to her initial birth?! Why show that all of a sudden? With no indication whatsoever that it's a flashback?  \n\nOverall I quite liked the series, it was an ok drama series, but holly molly that ending was unsatisfying that just left so many questions"
