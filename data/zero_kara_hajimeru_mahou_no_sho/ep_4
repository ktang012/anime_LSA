Here's how it works: sacrifices are made only during sorcery or the *creation* of magic. You saw Zero summon the weak sprite using a sacrifice in episode 2. The reason that sacrifices are also needed during the creation of magic is because *sorcery* is used to create the spells. \n\nThe spells themselves are instantaneous manifestations of demon or sprite abilities. So one would make a sacrifice to summon the demon, make a pact with it, and *then* the magic spell would exist for anyone to use anytime. That sprite's weak ass fireball could be turned into magic if Zero had made a pact with it.\n\nI'm guessing that the anime paraphrased the explanation of sorcery and magic for pacing issues. It's the slowest, most uneventful chapter in both the light novel and manga. While I understand why it was shortened for a 12 episode anime season, it's annoying to see it confusing so many people. It's just one of many things changed in the anime that makes things more confusing for people.\n\nAs for why Zero used a damage *transfer* spell to protect Mercenary, I haven't gotten that far in the light novel yet."
