I love how they made it seem like Boruto is scared of Hiashi because he's strict when in fact he's just like any [ol' grandchildren doting granpa.](http://i.imgur.com/iK2zvS5.png) [Hanabi is looking might damn fine too!](http://i.imgur.com/gUvapoO.png)\n\n~~[Also who the fuck is this dude and why does he have the Sage of the Six Paths mark on him?](http://i.imgur.com/TTxFBPc.png)~~ Scratch thet question, that was definitely [Naruto The Last](/s \"Motherfucking Toneri! You're suppose to be dead! WTF!?\")\n\nSo Himawari can already use Byakugan? That's pretty awesome, I can imagine the relief on Hinata when she found out her daughter doesn't have to go through the same hell she went through to unlock her Byakugan.\n\n\n\n[Chuuni Boruto is just great too with his notKamina glasses.](http://i.imgur.com/S90rKVy.png)\n\n[The motherfucking moon!](http://i.imgur.com/QRubFki.png) Glad to see they're connecting  The Last with the TV series, so far the only thing that felt canon there was Naruto and Hinata's wedding so this is good!"

Yet Boruto just bitches about his dad, has no real problems in life and is competent from no hard work at all. Episode 8 of Naruto has him outsmarting terrorists. Episode 8 of Boruto has him and his friends hanging out at the movies.\n\nThe show just doesn't have that emotional draw. I don't care about any of these characters because they're literally season 2 Neji; they were born OP and hate on the people who worked hard (i.e. Boruto hating on Naruto). We hated Neji in Naruto season 2. Why don't we hate these kids?\n\nThe most \"exciting\" part of the show is when old characters from Naruto come back. Because that's who we really care about. And we know, from the movie, that the plot barely goes anywhere until at least after the academy.\n\nI'm glad that this episode finally has the plot going somewhere.

   "text": "I've been having the same thoughts. I feel like they are trying to limit the amount of involvement of the old cast because they believe the new cast can only shine with familiar characters out of the picture. For me, it's been having the opposite effect. From what I've seen so far, the new characters don't really offer anything new or refreshing that the old characters haven't already given us. The only interesting aspect of these kids is how they fit into the context that their parents and elders have created. I wish Boruto introduced the cast the way Dragon Ball Z did. Gohan, Trunks, Goten, etc. all became beloved characters, and DBZ didn't have to remove any of the older characters to let them shine."
