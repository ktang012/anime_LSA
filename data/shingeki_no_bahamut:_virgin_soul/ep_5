I guess the King knew he was one of the people who beat Bahamut.  \n\nAlso its funny that Favaro's Nina Protection was his Afro, and without it she goes googoo and then dragon...  \n\nNina in prison is hilarious.

Given her speech to Charioce last week, and her inability to see how shitty her situation is, we really know how naive and sheltered she was before te start of the series - which is why she was so slow to catch onto Azazel's anguish. \n\nAnd Mugaro used to be blond? At least we know he's a boy for sure now. and FAVARO - it's too funny how his shit-talking in a bar is the reason he got into this apprentice trouble, like with Amira - he ever learns. \n\nHope we see more of Azazel next week \n"

He is not a strong fighter but a clever and smart one like Joseph Joestar. He uses tricks to beat his enemies. Lol. I think the reason why Charoice captured him is because he knew that he was the hero of prophecy and wanted to test him. You can see all the various things that the king was making him do .But like I said that's not how favarro fights so that might be the reason why he was throw into jail becasue he couldnt prove himself.\n\n\nAlso Nina excepting prison life was funny and sad because she had to spend her birthday in Jail."

I've said before that Kaisar is a good example of Lawful Good character without being Lawful Stupid anymore, and Nina is a good example how to write a strong as fuck female character without making her Mary Sue (looking at you Star Wars...). Making character strong or full potential, but show that they still need to train and learn as anybody else is good character building, but is forgotten at times. Of course Nina's kind of character isn't exactly unique, but I think it just shows how overall good and all around enjoyable package the whole Shingeki no Bahamut is.\n\nThirdly, I welcome this rise of Demon Brothels in my anime."

Everything is going to be so turned on its head that I truly can't fathom how it will end. I can only imagine that Sofiel is going to be stranded in the lower world since that would put her character into an interesting position, maybe together with Jeanne even, with jeanne asking Sofiel to guide her to the upper world, but other than that I can't think in how it would end.\n\nNow, I will still propose the theory that maybe Mugaro is not a special child because Jeanne was pregnant without man. I think that maybe, maybe Jeanne and Kaisar had sex in a situation that Kaisar doesn't remember but Jeanne does, and that the soul of Michael that was with Jeanne went to occupy the body that now is Mugaro. Kaisar doesn't remember it, Jeanne does and that is why she showed a little concern for Kaisar this episode, and a lot of shots and closeups that the show did last episode made me think that the writers and directors and foreshadowing this as a reveal.

   "text": "Basically there are two things, that by itself it would not be a thing for me, but for how the show framed Mugaro and Kaisar in almost the same way, something tells me that there is more than it seems.\n\nMugaro and Kaisar share black hair and blue eyes, with Mugaro's right eye being blue like Kaisar. Of course, if we see Jeanne's eyes, with see that Jeanne's share her eyes with Mugaro's left eye. It is in itself like a combination of both. Now, by itself I think it doesn't mean anything, but until two episodes ago we haven't had the shots they used until that moment and almost back to back. First we are shown Mugaro in a close-up to her/his face, we could have interpreted this as building tension to if what would happen if Sofiel identifies him, and then nothing else happens. Afterward in the same episode minutes later we have a really weird shot if Kaisar that actually doesn't work at all by itself in the context of what was happening, but what does this shot is? a really, really close up to Kaisar's face, the almost very same close up we just had with Mugaro, and we can see, of course, that Kaisar has blue eyes like Mugaro's, and black hair. \n\nThat's why I think Kaisar is the father, and the reason why Mugaro has powers is because, maybe, all related to Jeanne's past, and that it could be that Michael's soul was still with her, and then it passed down to occupy the body that is now Mugaro's. That's why when Mugaro's uses his/her power, his/her left eye, the one he/she shares with Jeanne, her mother, glows.\n\nAnd yeah, Kiasar isn't as dumb my statements could say that I think he is, but is isn't like he doesn't drink at all, and it seemed that he passed some time with Jeanne before she was captured, with Jeanne clearly showing some kind of respect for Kaisar in the shorts that we had that, timewise, come after the first season.\n\nEdit: Added last paragraph."
