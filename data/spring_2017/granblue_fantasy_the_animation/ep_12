   "text": "The story is basically a ''carbon copy'' of the plot Jrpg games used to have in the 90s, mostly due to people of the old Square Soft being involved in the development of the game and now in the anime. Is basically classic high fantasy with some undertones of steampunk, so to people can be either incredibly cliche and repetitive or a classic-nostalgia indulging. Is up to you really, it feels that this adaptation is highly aimed to the fanbase of the game and i enjoy retro-rpgs so i like this thing but i wouldn't expect something ''more'' is what it is"
