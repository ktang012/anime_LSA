The sneaky stuff by the bad guys are interesting.   \n  \nCompared to this, season 1 was a disaster in terms of writing imo. A weak ass protagonist who serves as self-insert, a conveniently loner god who takes a huge liking to the MC, a super strong girl who happens to like the MC too, a little loli who is actually not completely a good girl but is \"saved\" by the MCs kindness, and of course the skill that allows the MC to get out of any bad situation. Why does the story around the same world at the same timeframe differ so much? Is it adaption's fault, or are the cliches simply a matter of taste, and many people liked events of season 1?  \n  \n"

Hence why my link to xkcd : they put the story on Aiz, and the episode was better than the previous ones, notably the parts with Loki. Obviously those events are separate, so it should be a correlation without causality, even if fiction sometimes has ways to have events that should be unrelated be strangely similar.\n\nNow, of course it's also a bit more complicated than that. You seemed to mean that Aiz wasn't that good in this episode either.  On that aspect, I'll simply repeat a comment I made [somewhere else in the thread.](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/69g3ls/spoilers_dungeon_ni_deai_wo_motomeru_no_wa/dh6n6hf/?context=10000)\n\n> Something interesting is that Aiz took the initiative by herself in this episode - wen she decided to go to the Dungeon, and when she chased after the Hermes familia guy. Which, I think, is something people wanted to see - something fitting of a badass swordfighting girl with a strong personality.\n\n>I just hope we get actual sword badass swordfighting and strong personality in the later episodes.\n\nI don't mean that she wasn't independent in the previous episodes (her behavior with Loki and at the Monsterphilia are good examples), but I think this episode showed her in a much more proactive mood, while the previous ones had her make decisions in a reactive way instead."

For those interested, Bete has a second name, or a title - like Ais is known as Sword Princess - which is revealed in Loki's monologue during the sewer fight. [LN/manga spoiler](/s \"Bete is given the name of Vanagandr - Wolf of Disaster, due to his fast and vicious attacks. He is also Loki familia's fastest member.\")\n\nAlso, they removed small part of chat between Bete and Loki when they were on the way to the sewer, which I think most would find interesting, because you get to see [this face of Loki](http://i.imgur.com/GHbuZXW.png) in it. I think this is one of the more interesting settings in Sword Oratoria, because in the main DanMachi series, only Freya is portrayed as the bad god among them. Yet, in actuality, there are many other gods that dwell in Orario, are actually quite cunning and cynical themselves; Loki included. They also tone down the [gore content](http://i.imgur.com/OfJZ3iL.png) for obvious reason I guess. \n\nOverall, I think the production team is removing a lot of important contents that could really put the settings into a more interesting state than the current one we have, but given that it's only 12 episodes, I can understand why they aren't present here. It's really a shame, wish that it could be a 2 cour anime."

Like, why does that need to be a thing? \n\nAlso, despite her constant problem being that her chants get cut off because they take a while and monsters just generally don't want to sit down and wait, when she finally managed a chant, it wasn't because she was smart about it or anything. She spent for*ever* monologuing about how she was going to do this before she actually did it. She could have completed her chant twice before she started it. It was just frustrating to watch. If she *hadn't* managed to finish it, I would be right there with everyone on the passionately hating her because gosh darn it, she's not even trying to get this right. \n\nBut she did finish it, so whatever. She's not likely to become my favorite character, but I don't hate her. (But really, that food on Aiz's face thing is what makes me the most angry. I'm trying not to focus on it because it's such a silly thing to be angry about but why? Is food on your face cute in Japan?)"

It is pretty sad to see, and this is part thanks to the adaptation, with so little time and so much to adapt things get messy and Lefiya's portrayal as a character isn't well done. If you are curious to see how Lefiya is in the source and overall the story, read the manga, specially since in my opinion Lefiya carries hard half of the manga weight in all the translated episodes, and it should be that way all the way until around chapter 50.\n\nSadly, I don't think Lefiya's VA was well picked.\n\nOther than that, I think the best thing this adaptation has done is the portrayal of Tiona. I can't truly see another VA doing her job better, and all the mannerisms and movement are pretty much on point. Everytime Tiona appears from now on in the manga I will keep hearing this voice her VA is giving. It is on point."

I've always thought his character was entertaining to watch and giving him a bit more to do besides comic relief is always good.\n\nAlso, shameless self-plug here.
