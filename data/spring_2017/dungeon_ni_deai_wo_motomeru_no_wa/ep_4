They nearly always start out by building their world and have very similar premises but the way they diverge and build upon that is what makes them great.\n\nWhen they are turned into anime that which makes them great gets thrown away for the action they have. This ends up with a average anime at best and a community which starts to dislike anything that has to do with LNs."

I emphasize that I didn't read the manga or the LN for that very reason. \n\nAll I'm saying is that the mood in the comments has been all about how bad an adaptation this is, and not how good or bad the show is. For example, I like the first FMA series (with its original ending) than I do FMA:B. Nothing to do with how good an adaptation each is, but rather how good they are as standalone works. \n\nOnce this show reduced the crappy Lefya segments to a tolerable level, the show became good and interesting. Nothing about others being wrong in being disappointed."

I realize it may not be 100% what you wanted, but some of us who have only seen the anime adaptation would like to talk about something other than how this isn't exactly the same as the source material. I have to scroll all the way to the bottom basically to find the couple threads that just talk about the show as is and aren't comparing it and saying how bad of a translation it is from the original. \n\nPersonally, I'm enjoying the show. I like that we are getting more info on Ais who was heavily implied to be important but barely got time in the main series. It did start out kind of rough focusing on Lefiya so much, but they've turned that around and we are getting more Ais now. I'm still of two minds though about whether I think this gaiden was worth it over a potential S2 of Danmachi, but it is what it is and I'm enjoying it for what it is worth."
