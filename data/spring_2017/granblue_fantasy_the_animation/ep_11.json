   "text": "Holy shit! Sturm so [tiny!!](http://imgur.com/a/9KOVg) I knew Draph women are small in the game, but she's shorter than Lyria!\n\nI'm really enjoying this so far...I only wish A-1 could've given a bit more love to the animation as it does feel a little...lacking at times. The art style I love, however.\n\nReally hoping we get to see some crowd favorites later on. Rackam and [plant girl](/s \"Rosetta\") along with Drang and Sturm are a par for the course and it looks like we'll get the rest of the core \"crew\" from the OP etc...but I'd love to see the likes of [potential spoilers](/s \"Vira, Apollo, Orchid...Silva...maybe even the Society members\")\n\nNever really posted on here before...always been a resident lurker but I've been playing GBF religiously since the start of this year so I felt compelled to make a post...if anyone is considering giving the game a go after watching the show, I highly recommend it. Despite most gacha games, you can *technically* play full F2P, though your progression will be slowed down considerably. Since I started, however, Cygames have been quite generous with extra stuff they offer. Not sure if talking about the game is against sub rules, I'll edit my post if so, just wanted to give my thoughts :)"
