   "text": "I actually thought this was a great subtle way to give us a peek of Aiz's character. At the very least, the dynamic between Aiz and Bell. There are things that you can imply simply through the way pieces are introduced. Of course, explicitly stating something will always be the more obvious choice for viewers, but not necessarily contain most impact.\n\nBefore we saw this scene, we knew that Aiz was brutally beating Bell up. The heel kick combined with the overdone attacks showed her relentless side. You can argue whether she can dampen her power or whatnot, but arguing that will leave to more discussion about her intentions. If she really can't control her power, then she must be really merciless to agree to the training. If she can control her power but still decided to go full-throttle, well, you can see how her action speaks of her intentions.\n\nBut that's a totally different subject to began with. Moving on, a few seconds later, they showed a scene of Bell on her lap. Now, without context, many people would think that Bell was taking an early nap through the soothing breeze on Aiz's lap. However, after watching the previous seconds that led up to this scene, we can infer that it was Aiz who moved Bell onto her lap. All those brutal hits would knock him out, right? If so, then how can an unconscious person be in the right mind to move their head onto a person's lap?\n\nRather than trying to tackle a hard question, if we look the other way, then the scene makes more sense. What if Aiz was the one who moved Bell onto her lap? If so, then for what reason? Well, how many other reasons could possibly exist for a girl to want a guy's head on their lap?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: the scene in question may not have explicitly stated the narrative of the original novel, but it sure did give us an implication that was similar to it."

Not only there is nothing objective there, nor could you be, since one's opinion on art is inherently subjective, but you aren't actually looking. You are only looking at some opinions of others (which are subjective too) and confirm your views.  \n\n>They aren't even putting in a lot of the details people want from the manga  \n\nMost people dont read manga, and i don't know the people you are talking about, nor do people care what some manga readers wanted.  \n\nIt's simple you haven't been watching the show so your opinion has little value on these episodes or the show as a whole. What you're saying boils down to \"not like manga= bad\" , that's all and to be honest no one's interested to hear that.  \n\nBut instead you chose to talk shit about some person's standards because they dared to like something you aren't watching and aren't interested it. Good one. \n\n>But you keep on holding on to your opinion and lashing out at people you don't agree with no matter the reason\n\nI wasn't the one who told someone they have low standards, which is why i replied which to me is a good reason.

Just realize that just because dont like something doesn't make it bad. Works both ways.   \n\nThere is nothing wrong with liking Lefiya, anime viewers know just one version of the story and the story they are getting gives many of them enjoyment. Why would you want to demean that?  \n\nAnd when you do, you dont even know what exactly they are enjoying, since youre not watching the show. So yes you need to watch it to judge what they like, not like it will make it any more than your opinion."

Lefiya is quite [expressive](https://i.imgur.com/kakxDjY.jpg), at an [excessive](https://i.imgur.com/g6uqnsN.jpg) point for sure. But it's understandable as she both wants to get stronger and get closer to Aiz. Her [cheerfulness](https://i.imgur.com/kakxDjY.jpg) and honesty makes her a total contrast to [Filvis](https://i.imgur.com/bjQWVYS.jpg), but she's also naturally closer to her, being an elf and a caster, so I hope some of her fangirling would shift to Filvis. Also because [I ship them.](https://i.imgur.com/QWgIcN7.jpg)\n\nAlso important, it was really interesting to see to the relation between Aiz and Bell from her point of view. And after seeing her [reasons](https://i.imgur.com/E7z7lP9.png) (explicit or [not](https://i.imgur.com/8KfvEPA.jpg)), I'm not shipping them at all.

And honestly, up until this episode I thought that she was tolerable enough that she only annoyed me when they went too full on with her. \n\nBut this episode is where I'm completely done with Lefiya. The way that she fawns over Ais again and again and acts like she's getting NTR'd when she sees her with Bell (bearing in mind that Lefiya's feelings are EXTREMELY one-sided) just pisses me off to no end.\n\nMaybe they were trying to portray her more as a rival to Bell, but the way she's been presented over the whole series so far and in this episode especially just ruins that and turns her behavior towards Ais into an almost stalker-like possessiveness.
