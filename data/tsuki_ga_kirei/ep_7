However, the usual quota for said job is usually within the range of only 100 accepted applicants. Furthermore, you would need great grades and some practical experience beforehand to get a better chance of being recruited. \n\nNowadays, after graduating, I'll be lucky if I at least landed a job (full-time or part-time) just to get some money and source of finance going.

Whereas mangas seem to have a system in which if they sell well, they must scrap the idea of a coherent story ending, and instead keep building on it and rehashing it until the audience eventually drops off. Hence why so many manga animes that go on to have hundreds upon hundreds of episodes, with a drop in quality."

You get exceptions of course, but in the same way that anime is very much about archetypes and in-jokes about itself, LN's are that style of writing. It's more about ease of audience consumption than anything else...but to a very high degree? \n\nLike I would say someone like Stephen King is pretty easy going in terms of his writing style, compared to G.R.R.M, but Light Novels are often that idea flattened down even further. \n\nAlso bare in mind that we in the west only have access to stuff which is popular. Sometimes this is because it stands out among your typical LN crowd (like Monogatari) and other times it's because it just hits all the notes which LN readers want (SAO). I can't really say that LN's are bad, because I generally believe that most levels of literature have an audience they can reach and more complicated writing doesn't necessarily make your story better, but in terms of technical quality they are generally thought to be pretty low-end I believe."

   "text": "Being a sprinter in high school, no you don't go full on bonkers from the blocks except for 'taking off' (some can accelerate out of the blocks to the point where they look like they're jumping).\n\nA way that my coach told me to pace yourself in a dash is to imagine yourself being a plane taking off, with your head representing the plane. Preferably you look down for the first 20-40m, then start to look up as you accelerate further and then go full force. This is to reduce the strain on your legs from sudden yet forceful acceleration and a possible dampening in velocity once you get further down the track. Of course, by no means one should start slow like a snail, instead 'slower' relative to your top speed. Also, a sudden burst of unnecessary and unconditioned acceleration puts strain on your stamina, causing you to tire out faster, which then makes your sprint ineffective and slow down by the end when you're supposed to maintain your top speed.\n\nAssuming the creators know such things, then Hira was surprised when Akane suddenly bursted out like that. If you noticed, Akane was indeed going fast early on and was almost head-to-head with the leader, but slowed down after about the halfway point, with Chinatsu overtaking her. Being unfocused may be a factor, but her starting form was just bad imo since she is known to be faster than Chinatsu, causing her to lose.\n\nAny corrections are welcomed since it's been years after I completed school.\n\n[](#happydera)"

Remember, a person's acceleration can be changed whenever he/she wants, but that person's top speed is not as flexible and is most of the time constant unless an improvement is made in training and/or varying levels of anxiety and adrenaline in a tournament. Once Akane started to slow down to pace herself, her intended stamina for the burst acceleration after the 40m mark was already partly spent, causing her final top speed to be worse than usual.\n\nSource: 5 years in my school's athletic team and had the same problem early on where I had terrible stamina and stamina management."

She's the kind that wouldn't give up easily and that she will try anything if she can, especially if that something already belongs to someone else. An evidence to this personality trait of hers was [when she casually bit off a chunk of Akane's popsicle without waiting for Akane's OK.](http://i.imgur.com/Wpd7rxL.png) I don't think she does it out of malice though, she probably has no idea that what she's doing is wrong.\n\nI'm curious what Akane will do though. Will she let her best friend confess and have faith in Kotarou to turn her down. Or will she just follow her sister's advice and drop Chinatsu? \n\nAlso poor Kotarou. To be called by ~~Kadokawa~~ Kadoyama Publishing and be told that you have no talent and should stick to Light Novel writing instead. Don't do it Kotarou! You're better than all of us! Throw those free LNs away!\n\n--------------------\nCan I just want to add that the sound design for this show is absolutely beautiful? You actually get ambient sounds that makes the show feel more alive. Just take the track scene for example.

I tried *Inspect* in Chrome but it just led to multiple images in a sprite tile instead of a gif and  google image search with that led to [this](https://www.google.de/search?tbs=sbi:AMhZZitb6_1lN4ixzfQewNnyCiDUlvCHyMqI_1Qd91b3sTdVrynMKhK8VL3NogqcJTOhRYWCRZoC2xwF3Nk9FqOWAW2QDDpYrX31938AcJH2oL1STNGHmgRA0OHJMOXaMbmduvGs-If3sbyz7wjh1XwSQHuE89Kd0_1cmDupcCOxBx6wzL2x7BPYNLqwEJlKMMRVQIECwwilNDXp_1CrTwMTSeACLidAIwsAazW87LMGqA8fSLQeNOZnWGwI378M8IuUxJjxbmFwV5yNKvlIeupHc0wM4OMiJCLz_1IMdJzy-qmKWgBpz4G4J-V1ksH7spSQAi8m3y5A0Q3Q98fei53GhO5LV_1f2cTBS1Tnduk1_1ESrUmODCRkvGqJF_18g669ih85n4wXLFkPBEZv6tf09fXrWlQutD3tBLCIy8ivNPonBKrq5SO4f7bTRSF47IBHCplia_1U_1Wo0jCb1Kj6OMHWki-Eakms-OepTd15mIGaJMMA7ptQUIicVw53dvwkc-y5kmLhR9O3OpJpvK-2Dvdmvdw6L7N6CLXb7_1CQNjlxxpoJQ0xpa3573s_1IYdIjlffUvqFRWtd-8GU-c1LFUfJmC1GHJkGCcvxbsRhIW00goNOzpZLXcX-u3pbfb3kxDKVdwPLP6Y0HHqx73b3ne488P4o0aVf-_1KDomwJzWfv7LDk0fY2VmOS6LQZ64-DqN69RfFBMf80Ah7ztTEAnN2af7t6601tA1uscBgUbzr3ODzlxw9S79LdlD_1wGstF9xc8zter32zkWn7Ko8MOaov6fcvQaaR3rBrywZOXv8R4KPtrgMVIQZTTqruWXf19ItGHCUkJUrt8ID6rGcrc5cd85pZyhcuPNDHHXblYQuGClJKyGgryibWhxlyN8yK3DBbYwdNwwdGasMJ0zot0mRTYjokmS1TAuijMMqQsoeMGsvn9mPp508bhQhjw-BRBvHMSau-GyJ4Wun1Netl_1npejG6mfU-Ti9qqcHHWmyKhf4sSspXlaj11DbkAMS3PtCXo-tMtL2skEBURYkgrbHzwVOuDw-zwUk8CrZ1h8typc0_1Mjy-vDCgZWasvI8AZN6JxH_1I9L15pXzoFGVeKRxQ4rpkBCPeMowdj7C2OzH411qG7Ze-b0TZIxfTWj-MCJLi_1YCJU72TrVz3e3ugavQhJpo0-RdDCNGPkQpggrTXRzs9xd5Q3m25yzoIuCSRM7PR3ad5XAEI7KKgHkGfhS5ZvYSCA22WoYqY5n1vpsO-sOcHAgthyCGFdHnC2FdKrx6hF1aLyBKrxGP8xRFThwITqfzF0xHYnSfclviYOGmJDAKGkBzS76Dda2aEeqN6ujvFnEBhj17CQxMhsMCjzhHnLzivi0o-y7CNWOCzwcLnl-d7hKLbm8SdAD0XOKi8ehU37oSQDZpe9fw5Lx1Se5YQ2gVLUdn3vmLUNNb9z3sq7kojgBXawTgn7JzdfIv0&width=191&gws_rd=cr&ei=CDAeWYnVHsiFgAbug52ABw) (not *that* helpful)."

That doesn't make them bad people.\n\nSecondly, Akane isn't shown to turn up late. We aren't shown long scenes of Kotarou waiting and looking pensive, we have a short scene of him reading a book. Either that's very bad direction (which she show hasn't had so far) or the more logical answer is that Kotarou is possibly early or she is within acceptable bounds in terms time, whatever that may be. This scene is nothing like the other scene, where she was alone in an unusual environment with no way to contact Kotarou and she felt snubbed by him. Also she gets over this very quickly, it's not like she harps on about it.\n\nI would appreciate it if you stop projecting onto this series, because it's pretty clear you are."

   "text": "God, I love this show. I love how cute it is, I love how nice it represents the relatonships, be it the family, the couples, the friends. But what I love more is how the pacing of the show is so chill that it lets everything breathe and speak, and by that I mean the visuals, the direction, each event is meaningful in its own way.\n\nEven though Akane and Kotauro are in a relationship, there's still a \"barrier\" between them, which is represented by almost every time they have a conversation face to face there's always something dividing them, be it a tree, a pillar or, like in this episode, the bookshelf, but there're also moments when they are together, when they reach mutual understanding.\n\nThe race was a good way of showing (and maybe predicting or warning) about Akane and Chinatsu's relationship, at least when love is concerned. Akane started strong and had the lead for a moment, but her being worried about what Chinatsu said and not focusing and giving her best made her lose the lead and Chinatsu passed her, something that MIGHT as well happens if Akane doesn's steps up her game.\n\nAnother thing that caught my attention, Kotarou and the Editor and the bottle of Tea? Both Kotarou and the Editor have a paper cup but the Editor has the bottle, he doesn't offer any to Kotarou, reflecting that he has full control of the conversation and doesn't give a chance for Kotarou to speak, plus there's a brief shot of a drop running down from the bottle the moment the Editor says that Kotarou doesn't have any talent and he should make light novels, but that doesn't mean Kotarou really was too affected by that, he just didn't any saying in that conversation for his personality but he remained quite composed, his hands didn't twich that much and mantained quite relaxed, I guess starting from the moment the moment the Editor gave him his bussiness card and reacted to that was a sign that this wasn't going anywhere, but I don't know if that's correct or if there was anything else in the card that made him react. And after that and Kotarou was given the bag full of what I assume are light novels and goes home and his mother told him that writing is not good, he didn't react that much either, he just looked at the bag, contemplating the option but the next scene with him, the bag is next to the trash can and Kotarou reflecting before texting Akane and the conversation in the library where he reafirms that he'll do his best. \n\nThis whole thing makes me respect the guy, even though he was told straight that he sucks and he shouldn't pursue his dream, he's still pretty firm about it and that his relationship with Akane is actually pretty good for both of them, suporting each other. This show man... It may be slow as hell but what it wants to tell is sooo good. I hope it mantain this quality."

Her timing for these interactions is always bad, as if she knew when Akane's most vulnerable.\nLike when Akane said that she didn't know what to do, but that they're friends, it feels like the moment Chinatsu felt she was off the hook she crossed a boundary, she pushed that limit.

Damn you Japan and your lack of boundaries when it comes to dating and cockblocking. Lucky for Akane we all know the hypotetical outcome if Chinatsu actually confesses to Kouta. Too bad Akane is too paranoid and lacks confidence in herself and in Kouta, so I guess we will see her strungling with her inner demons for a while if she doesn't stop Chinatsu.\n\nGoing back to Koutaro.

It's a good thing his dad is the one that [manages the guns](http://imgur.com/XMIS5C9.jpg) around the house (I wonder if his dad is a mailman and if he likes to climb up stairs)\n\n[Miu & Inaba](http://imgur.com/z6WGnWk.jpg) are legitimately the best couple of the whole series.

Long story short, [Melos] (/s \"is a young shepherd with a sense of equity in ancient greek that gets entangled in an assasination atempt of the current ruler Dionysius. He begs Dionysius to postpone his execution for three days so he can attend his sister's weeding ceremony. Dionysius agrees with his plead, but asks for a collateral to take his place, so Melos' best friend Selinuntius is being held up, and will be executed instead of Melos if he doesn't come back in 3 days to take his place in the execution.\")\n\nThe parallels as I see it, would be Akane representing Melos, Chinatsu playing Dionysius and Kotarou would be the collateral Selinuntius.\n\n"

What he said today didn't help his chances, and we know that, like Chinatsu, nothing will really come of his own confession, but it's most likely a step the anime will take to have Azumi on the same side of the coin as Akane.)\n\n/u/SmurfRockRune and I agree once again in that them failing at their respective passions, while disheartening for them and for us, makes for a strong narrative moment. Now they get to support one another in their trying time, testing not only their mettle as enthusiasts of track and writing but also their commitment towards one another.\n\nLastly, those shorts are still amazing. Sakura's fantasies, Ryouko purchasing the magazine after Roman's comments (which are totally true), and all of Miu x Inaba's exchanges are cute, hilarious scenes that end each episode in a splendid manner. :D"

   "text": "As for Kotarou's \"failure,\" certainly there's a myriad of extremely successful authors who's first works were rejected. A quick Internet search tells me, for instance, that \"John Grisham\u2019s first novel was rejected 25 times\" so I don't think Kotarou should give up his dream. After all, that was only one publishing company. Someone might have actually have had a different opinion. Even one of the most successful mystery writers, Rex Stout, didn't even start writing novels until he was 48-years old! Kotarou's got a jump-start on his career."

   "text": "Chinatsu being upfront of her feelings is actually pretty mature of her. She doesn't want to hide this from Akane knowing that she is in a relationship with Kotarou because they are friends and something like this you can't hide from each other. I think in most romance stories they would try to hide it to have the dramatic tension later. So being honest about it now makes her pretty great. \n\nI'm sure Akane is still worried, naturally so because Azumi might have a reason to choose her since she is more comfortable in talking to him than she is. I guess we'll just have to wait. Great Episode 10/10"
