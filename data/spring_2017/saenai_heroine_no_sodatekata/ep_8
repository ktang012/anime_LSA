   "text": "When Megumi and Utaha talked on the roof, Utaha admits that Sayuka from Koisuru Metronome and Ruri from their new game are both based off her. In the past when Tomoya was asked to choose between which heroine to win in Koisuru Metronome,a character based off Utaha herself and one she created, Tomoya refused to choose. When the script for Ruri's route was submitted for the game, Utaha did not want Tomoya to choose between which route was better, she wanted to present the exact same choice Tomoya refused to do in the past, but now has to as a director, to decide between a heroine based off herself, or a different heroine based off Megumi. The other heroine being based off Megumi is a significant difference from the first time. \n\nSo when they were at the table talking and Tomoya says \"this was not the game I wanted to make\", Tomoya without realizing it had rejected the scenario Utaha wanted their real life relationship to play out, Tomoya choosing Sayuka/ Ruri/ Utaha as his main heroine. Of course the script was not well written for a visual novel, Utaha never intended it to be, she just wanted Tomoya to choose her, as she personally admits later on in the episode to Megumi. \n\nTomoya obviously completely missed that point and rejected the script in this episode. However, the important part to Utaha is that Tomoya still did not choose Utaha even when he was given the choice to choose her. Utaha tries to ask Tomoya the same question again later on, the morning after her she cried in the bath, \"Which do you prefer\" referring to the heroines based off her and Megumi, and Tomoya says that he likes them both, however Utaha replies \"I don't mean it like that\". Tomoya still has not gotten the message that Utaha wanted him to choose between the real life representations of the game's heroines Meguri and Ruri, Megumi and Utaha herself. Hence the seemingly weird moment episodes before where Utaha asked Tomoya to choose whether she went to a College that was close or one that was far, they are all the same choice, which Tomoya seems to be missing. Utaha wants Tomoya to choose her as his main heroine. \n\nIn the previously mentioned scene after Tomoya says he likes both of the game's heroines, Tomoya also mentions he wants an ending where Ruri and Meguri fight over the game's protagonist. Utaha replies that a part of her sees that scenario as impossible, but another part of her wants to see that play out. The first part is important because Utaha realizes that there was no choice to begin with and that is why Tomoya never realizes or chooses based off the scenarios Utaha had written for him. Tomoya had already long ago chosen Meguri/Megumi. So as much as Utaha wants to see the scenario of her and Megumi fighting over Tomoya in real life, Utaha realizes that she never had a chance to begin with.\n\nThe simple fact that Tomoya is making a game based off his and Megumi's first encounter is indicative of that. Tomoya may have not realized it yet, but it was essentially love at first sight. \n\nWatch the entire scene at Tomoya's house with that in mind and every time the two heroines are brought up, replace them with Utaha and Megumi. It becomes very obvious that this was a farewell episode for Utaha, whether that be her coming to terms with her relationship with Tomoya or her sending Tomoya off, both as a director, and as someone she loves. At near the end of the episode, the two heroines meet up on the roof top and Utaha sends off the chosen heroine, Megumi, to meet the protagonist, Tomoya. \n\nWhen Megumi meets Tomoya at the end of the episode, she introduces herself as Ruri/ Sakuya, probably in attempt to try to convey Utaha's feelings in her place, or simply to show her appreciation for Ruri/ Sayuka/Utaha's feelings that Tomoya failed to receive.  Megumi still wants Tomoya to look at her as Ruri/ Sayuka from the game for now and not as Kato Megumi because she knows that Tomoya still has not realized the connection between the game and real life. If Tomoya chooses Megumi now, he would be choosing Ruri, who isn't even based off Megumi, from the game and not Megumi herself. Whether that be a selfish wish of a Megumi who likes Tomoya back and wants Tomoya to choose her out of his own will, or simply a Megumi who one day wants Tomoya to choose between real life, and not a game.\n\n**Because fun fact, the tittle of the original novel and anime \"Saenai heroine no Sodatekata\" could be translated as \"How to raise a boring heroine\", or probably the better suited, but sounds terrible in English, \"The way a boring heroine raises\" or \"How a boring heroine raises\" meaning how does the boring heroine raise someone else up. I use boring in reference to Megumi as the main heroine, but \"Saenai\" could also mean unsatisfactory/ unappealing/ unattractive/ dark/ sullen, with those meanings obviously referring to how the other Heroines view themselves. This is not a story that focuses on how Tomoya raises Megumi up as a heroine, it is a story about how the heroines raise Tomoya up, as both Utaha and Megumi do in this episode.**\n\nIn regards to Eriri, she has not been able to draw anything for a while now as indicated by the mass amounts of crumbled paper and her own self admittance. However, at the end she comes to the school festival and was able to draw right away, a beautiful picture of protagonist/ Tomoya dancing with Meguri/ Megumi. Eriri has also realized that she herself cannot visualize Tomoya being with anyone else other than Megumi anymore.\n\nAlso in reference to the burning part, near the end of the episode you can see the school camp fire for the dance metaphorically burning Utaha away when she talks with Megumi on the roof, as well as Eriri at the last second as she draws her picture. In contrast Megumi/ Ruri bursting from the flames in that beautiful scene. If there ever was a doubt, as Utaha mentioned in the first season, the main heroine was chosen long before any of this started.\n\nHonestly one of the best episodes in any Romantic Comedy anime I have ever watched. I highly recommend rewatching it.\n\n"

Even the other challenger who is merely watching the game (Eriri) can only look on in awe and despair. \n\nTruly the stuff of Champions (Best Girl). Simply incredible."

I wish I knew exactly why he cried though. It's quite realistic. Makes me think of a similar situation where I cried because I rejected a friend so hard, because I felt nothing for her, even though she checked almost all the boxes for what I wanted in someone. In this case, it seemed ambiguous. Unless I'm the dense one.\n\nBut yes.

LN adaptation reaching season 4 is a bit rare to say the least.\n\n2-cour Season 3 to properly warp up the story would be the best we could hope for, that's why commercial success for S2 is quite important.  The optimistic read on this is that due to exclusive broadcast deals with Amazon in the west and Iqiyi in China, the revenue from broadcast alone is rumored at multi-million dollars already, more than enough to break-even the production cost, so any BD sold from now are likely pure profit, making a relatively good case for S3."

   "text": "Another interpretation of this series is that if you rewatch it with Kato being the main heroine it's a romantic comedy, but if you rewatch it with Utaha being the main heroine, it slowly becomes a bittersweet-tragedy of a love she can never reach. Especially when Utaha is the only 3rd year, she will be the only one leaving. They really did a good job adapting this part of the light novel. More elaboration about the Ruri x Sayuka x Utaha relationship is better explained in the Koisuru Metronome Spin-off manga. Here is a picture from the White Album 2 visual novel: https://cgv.blicky.net/wat/0143.jpg . And a picture from the Sping-off manga: http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZsyuqJSNe-s/Vh7ncNWT7HI/AAAAAAAAgRE/y-yRXERpRp0/s0-Ic42/002.png .\n\nAlso some of you may be thinking Tomoya spent 2 nights alone with a girl and didn't do anything and might see him too much of a pussy or unrealistic. But I think it's because he does nothing really emphasizes his otaku personality. Shows u the level of seriousness he takes his passion. I've never seen a MC of a harem anime talk that roughly to a heroine even when she is down. Which seems more realistic to me, like how he did so to Eriri in season 1. I don't consider Tomoya a generic character at all."

   "text": "This was among the best Saekano episodes I've seen, not because of the fanservice, but because of the actual plot progress of the series. It's all the more heartbreaking because the series is supposed to be funny, but that's the beauty of 'light' series: they hit harder because one never expects being hit. \n\nI disagree with people saying that Aki is an idiot. Teenage males tend to have one-track minds. Even men, in general, tend to have one-track minds. Sure, most teenagers would focus into getting laid by a hot, buxom lady like Utaha. Aki isn't like most guys: his one-tracked mind is focused on creating a successful visual novel. Despite Utaha's charm, she fails to see what actually tickles his fancy. She relies on her body, on provocation, to lure Aki. But Aki operates on a sensual level, not a figurative one. He's naturally reclusive by nature, and despite his passions, is respectful to the women he is surrounded by. That's why most of them are comfortable around him: he's so focused into his project that he wouldn't touch them, even despite the fact that they'd want to be touched. *We*see how the women look and feel as omniscient observers: Aki doesn't see Utaha's face when she longs for him, or her crying inside his bathroom. We may think that Aki is an asshole, but he's not. He just want to finish his VN, and respects Utaha as his senpai to ever think of her otherwise. \n\nThe tragedy of Utaha is that she fails to see his denseness because all she sees from Aki is the supportive, caring guy. He is, but he is also aloof because his passion is the completion of the VN. When she discovers his answer (which was, actually) to finish the VN without her, she tries her best to lure him in with suggestion - again, not very effective because Aki never saw her as a sexual being. Aki thrives in VNs because the text isn't too heavy: he doesn't need to rely on his imagination as much. Utaha thrives on prose because she is extremely imaginative. She will always be disappointed because parallel lines will never meet. \n\nKatou sees through everything, however. And it's shaping up to me that she, like Aki, shares his passion in seeing things through. At this rate, with her persistence, she will be the only one who moves his heart because she is the only one who could see what he sees: she wants to finish the VN first, even though she may be starting to like Tomoya. Ironic, right? But I think it's telling that the second season is called FLAT. Katou's going to be the most important woman in Aki's life. That's why she is the only one who can dance with Aki in the closing scene of the episode: she sees Aki for what he is, and he appreciates it. "

   "text": "[Spoilers](/s \"When Utaha first met Aki she was in the middle of writing Koisuru Metronome. The first girl in that series was Sayuka who was based off Utaha herself. Second girl was part of a love triangle for the LN protagonist and was basically a foil of Sayuka(Utaha). The rest is partially my interpretation but for the final volume of Koisuru Metronome she wrote 2nd girl as the winner and wanted Aki to read it before it was fully published on hopes of Aki expressing that he wanted Sayuka to be the winner (he initially liked Sayuka more which is why Utaha felt attraction to him in the first place). However he didn't want to read the drafts because he wanted to read it when it was published, leading her to feel it was him abandoning Sayuka(Utaha) to her fate for his own ethics (Mr. Ethical). In this arc she tries the same thing, casting Ruri as herself while Meguri is obviously Katou and asking Aki whether he would choose Ruri (herself) over Meguri (Katou). Again it's also related to her university choice too as she would choose being closer to Aki if he would choose her over the others. However again he doesn't outright accept or reject her proposal, he'd rather focus on what he thinks he wants, which is implicitly rejecting her feelings for him but in a more painful way than just rejection. In that if he understood the symbolism and rejected her feelings it meant he was at least considering her romantically, his way is more like 'I would never consider romance with you because you aren't a woman to me but just my favorite light novel author.\")"

Eriri having to draw the scene of her best friend and rival's happy moment. Damn I love Saekano's character dynamic.\n\nHowever I don't know what this bodes for Utaha's decision to stay or leave. As I predicted Aki tried to have both route in the game, an act of trying to have it all. But that final Katou-Utaha moment seems like she's passing the torch. She's saying that Ruri doesn't have to be an Utaha carbon copy, that Katou can improve upon her  by herself. That's also why Katou releases her ponytail, in an effort to be closer to Utaha's hairstyle. It's like a ceremonial thing that means she is inheriting Utaha's role in the team. \n\nShit pls don't leave Utaha. Saekano isn't the same without all 3 heroines bickering. "

Well, she did try to use her body to fuck up the team again, but Aki didn't react to it.
