Like, Todoroki's at 530,000 while these scrubs are batting 50,000 destroy. You really get the feeling that there is nothing most of the students could have done against that, and every adult in the audience understood that too. It's also effective storytelling that it doesn't feel cheesy or absurd. It's just that the kid won the genetic lottery. At great cost, as we're learning. In short,\n\ntodoroki too op pls nerf"

It's also hard to incite/get a villain angry when they know that's what you're trying to do.\n\nYou could argue that he successfully did it with Midoriya, but honestly that made no sense. He was explicitly told not to respond, but he did it anyway despite having been established as a relatively smart character. I guess you could chalk that up to him being emotional when it comes to his friends. \n\n>Plus, when was the last time you saw a supervillain who knew when to shut the hell up?\n\nTrue ... but none of them had to go against someone that would mind control them if they didn't shut up. \n\nI think his best solution would be to approach someone from behind/change his voice/have a voice modifier, so they wouldn't know who it was. They'd respond like normal then be mind controlled. Easy peasy. "

Deku's superpower-induced hallucination only gave him the ability to move his fingers for a few seconds, which wouldn't exactly have helped much if he hadn't used it to injure himself in order to break the mind control.

   "text": "I don't think Bakugo will ever win the finals. His character depth is focused around being obsessed with being first, yet always having to take a backseat to either Midoriya or Todoroki. Bakugo doesn't take being second, as being second to him feels like having lost just as much as he would being 16th. Placing first wouldn't require Bakugo to develop any further, because it'd just confirm his wrong ideals that not being first means you're worthless.\n\nAs for Deku, he will either lose this round against Todoroki, or make it to the finals vs Bakugo. The second situation will make Deku end up winning the finals, because like I said before, there's no narrative reason for having Bakugo win. I don't see Deku winning the finals either because narratively he can't become #1 this early in the series, that wouldn't make sense within his development considering this is a long-running series about Deku becoming the \"#1 hero\" like he says in the intro.\n\nTherefore, if Deku can't win the finals, and Bakugo can't either, then Todoroki will be the one who ends up winning them (probably using fire, making him win in a way that he himself hates). Since Todoroki has to be the one to win the finals, he will also be the one to win the duel vs Midoriya."

Bakugou was endlessly praised for the strength of his quirk and pushed toward becoming a hero by society around him. This praise also lead to Bakugou believing himself to be absolutely superior to his peers, causing him to become a bully.\n\nShinsou is the opposite of that in a different way than Deku. His quirk immediately caused everyone around him to think of villainous acts. While society didn't directly push him to become a villain, it never stopped reminding him what his quirk would be good at. Shinsou could have turned out a lot worse than he did in this environment. Thankfully, all he has is a chip on his shoulder and a strong desire to prove himself.\n\nThe tournament arc is where MHA strongly suggests that it wants to deal with the unintended negative consequences of a quirk based society. Between Shinsou's treatment and Todoroki's family, it's hard to think of this superpowered world as an idealized society even when you have a quirk."

First from himself, them from All Mighty and then from Ojiro right before the match started. He also barely got past 2nd round and here he is about to lose in a pathetic way against something that he knew about and disappoint everyone.\n\nShinsou Quirk is one that affects the target mental state and controls it, I don't think it's unreasonable to think that someone with a strong will can overcome it, specially since Shinsou is young/in training.\n\nAssuming he could get his Quirk to activate, do you think Shinsou could control strong willed characters like Endevour and All Mighty for long? I don't think so.\n\nSo my interpretation of the Shadow figures is nothing more than an subconscious visual representation of what it means to have One for All and all the responsibilities that come with bearing this power that he sees on the last possible second\n\nIn my opinion the Shadows show up in Deku mind as a way to say \"Really, is this the best you can do? The power that all of us worked hard to build up and you are going to lose here like this? \" and look down on him. \n\nIt isn't the shadows that break him free, but his own will to not disappoint the previous OfA users.\n\nGo to episode 18 at rewatch the scene at 12:15 again, it's the responsibility towards not disappointing his friends that makes him use OfA, but on the fight against Shinsou instead of being \"win for the sake of his friends\" it's more like \"win as to not disappoint the previous OfA users and myself\".\n\nThat restored mentality makes him use OfA on his entire body in a last attempt to break free, he only gets control over 2 fingers but thankfully that's enough.\n\nAll of this is baseless speculation by me on the scene. It's quite possible that it's just bad story writing but I want to believe :/"

Quirk erasing doesn't really work against robots, and I doubt he was physically strong enough to take them down with his own human power back then. It makes you wonder how Eraserhead became a hero in the first place. Maybe they didn't have giant robots for the entrance exam when he was a kid? Maybe his entrance exam was more like a tournament like what they're doing now and the top winners in the tournament would become the students. It'd be very easy for him to place high in a tournament with his erasing quirk."

I was about to ask if this was explained further in the manga because my memory was a bit hazy but it was somewhat clarified by All Might.  Second, I can't believe that UA just allows such a really huge flaw in their entrance exam and evaluation.  Like really.  Shinso has probably one of the scariest Quirks in this universe but the one-sided way the school does their exams really undersell it.  Plus, he's able to apply it very well by knowing how to shit talk people into activating his Quirk."

What if the One For All inheritors start to see \"visions\" like that which shows they are closer to mastering the power? All Might looked very sad when he said \"That's a good thing\". I think something happens to the person who gives his powers to the next generation and he remembered what happened to his Master at the time (Death?). Maybe all the things they have done in the past which would normaly destroy a normal human body (as we can see Midoriya wrecking his shit every time), would slowly start to damage their bodies with no chance of recovery now that they lost their powers for good? But since All Might always has the people and doing the right thing in his mind, he doesn't care what happens to him knowing Midoriya will be a good successor. Well at least im 100% sure there is more to these \"visions\" and that All Might and Recovery Girl know exactly whats happening but won't tell Midoriya to not put more pressure on him than necessary."

It'd be much better than the existing spinoff about a dude who can \"slide across flat surfaces\" - That series raises its own merits but is ultimately really lame."

So anything mindless would be rather good vs him. But as anything like that would most likely have a person behind them he could just control that person. \n\nSomeone with multiple personalities I assume he controls the body more. Think about what happened with Deku. He was away of what his body was doing but couldn't do anything about it. Same would apply I'd imagine to anyone. Regardless of how many personalities they had. \n\nI think (an I could be wrong) they have to actually say something for him to control them. A grunt/groan wouldn't do. Tho it depends on the context. I think (an I maybe completely wrong) but his power works a long the lines of him asking you a question starts certain steps in your brain to reply. Its kinda like a set up. He can control you cause your replying to him meaning he is the one causing your brain to work in a certain way.\n\nKinda like the statement \"Don't think of kittens.\" What the first thing you think of? Kittens. Its a mental trick an his quirk take advantage of his questions that sets that process up and controls it after a certain point (when they reply).\n\nNow keep in mind also Quirks have been shown to get stronger the more they are used.

No way she has a chance of going against any of the three. Kaminari too, he might be a match to Bakugou with destructiveness but he doesn't have his maneuverability and versatility that Bakugou's explosions provides, and he has that idiot mode to deal with too. You can't just write \"gravity\" and \"electricity\", and say that they have stronger quirks than Todoroki, their quirks aren't that simple.\n\nLook at Todoroki though, he just froze an **extremely** large area in a short amount of time without breaking a sweat. I don't think any of the other students have shown a feat close to that yet, he'd beat most people in a 1v1 with that. Maybe Midoriya and Bakugo can beat him, (or maybe not), but don't forget that he's only been using half of his full power. He still hasn't used his full potential with his fire powers."

Horikoshi needed some way to introduce the concept of the previous One For All users existing in some form of lingering presence inside the newest OFA user. But they aren't like fully conscious spirits, more like imprints. And they certainly aren't the dead souls of the previous users or anything like that since All Might had a presence there and he's alive.\n\nSo he needed a way to demonstrate this lingering presence to show that One For All doesn't only pass down the physical strength of its predecessors. It also passes down their mental fortitude. \n\nIn essence, Deku saved himself by using the mental aspects of One For All to overcome the brainwashing. He wasn't saved by some dead people hiding inside his body. He subconsciously activated the mental strength that One For All has been building up over the past few generations to clear up just enough of the brainwashing to regain control of his two fingers.\n\nSo, no deus ex machina here.

I fell in love with this show so much that I actually went and read through the manga. I've never done that before, not even with Attack on Titan which I also liked a lot. For everything else I was able to wait, but not MHA. They just did such a great job hyping up Deku and the potential of his power, I just had to see how much better he becomes. Spoiler alert: he fucking does, and thensome. \n\nI definitely recommend checking out the manga. At first I thought I wouldn't like knowing everything coming up but it's not been that way at all. In fact, I'm even *more* excited to watch the show now because I know what scenes are coming up and I want to see them in glorious animated form. I was majorly looking forward to the scene with the silhouettes of the previous OFA users because it wasn't very well defined in the manga. Seeing it in this form makes it look so much better.\n\nAlso the fight scenes, while still amazing in the manga, are truly that much better in animated form. I might know how the fights are going to go but much of the fight gets left to your imagination when you have to piece together what happens between each panel. It'll be so much nicer seeing these fights in a crisp and fluid animation.\n\nSeriously though, go check out the manga. You won't regret it."

Try reading through at least a couple of the upcoming fights before you decide whether or not you like it. I guarantee you'll be hooked before then though.\n\nYou can read it all here: http://mangaslice.com/manga/boku-no-hero-academia\n\nThis episode ended at the end of chapter 34. Chapter 35 is where next week's episode will start. Go back and read through chapters 33 and 34 and compare them to today's episode (most episodes tend to cover 2 full chapters). You'll see just how great they're doing at adapting the source material. Key scenes and frames are reproduced almost perfectly. It doesn't feel like just an anime adaptation of the manga. It truly feels like the manga came to life in animated form.\n\nI understand though if you still don't want to. As I said, I never enjoyed reading manga either. I just think you'd find that MHA is an exception to that. You just have to be willing to give it a try.

I realized that and it made it a lot easier to just read on. One extra benefit is that you're pretty much immune to spoilers this way. In fact, that's part of the reason I ended up reading the manga.

   "text": "I'm interested to hear how else you think the situation could have been handled, with Midoriya winning this fight. I think Horikoshi handled it well, weaving in the concept of psychological v physical quirks. Eraser Head and Shinsou have psychological quirks, which are a rarity for this world. While it appears, to everyone from the outside, that Deku's quirk is purely physical, they are unaware about the inwardly psychological ramifications of cultivating the physical capabilities & lingering will of many. As such, it really is a psychological clash, rather than simply physical. This aspect, which Shinsou is unaware of, given the secrecy regarding the true nature of Deku's quirk, puts him at a disadvantage. This is the first time though, that Deku has faced off against a psychological quirk that doesn't inhibit his own quirk (like Aizawa's does). As such, the appearance of the previous torch-bearers, from a storytelling standpoint, is a viable option, in my opinion. \n\nThere are no future reliances on this plot thread through, up to the current manga chapter count. As I mentioned earlier, psychological quirks are a rarity. So I'd encourage you to watch on, as your supposed 'HUGE red flag' is for naught. Don't worry about this instance, and continue. The rest of the series is more intellectual, and less spiritual, as far as the manga's run would suggest at least."

If he took his aggression out on his father, then his fight with Sero would have been different, and he may not have had the raw emotion to unleash such an attack. That huge attack changes Deku's perception of Todoroki, so that's important, and is hard to alter for future events. As for something else doing it, instead? That would be wholly unfair on Shinsou, and the judges would probably call for a rematch. There is to be no outside interference, after all. Letting a match continue if there was, would be contrived. Deku had to overcome the brainwashing with his own power, and the lingering wills of those that wove One For All is a perfectly legitimate way of countering psychological warfare. After all, One For All isn't your regular physical enhancement. There is a spiritual aspect, that isn't replicable in any other quirk. "

The mangaka does a good job of balancing that out. It's just that One For All is unique, and you'll find out about that more later. Well they are interested in exploring them...hence the time spent looking into his character here, and in the future. Same goes for Aizawa.
