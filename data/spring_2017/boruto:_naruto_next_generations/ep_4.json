Also finally get some Sakura! \n\nThis episode was really enjoyable though, we see a lot of Borutos side during the movie in regards to the relationship he has with Naruto so it's nice to get a bit of the other side here, show a bit of Narutos issues and how they play onto the relationship they have formed. I still side with Boruto overall and think Naruto should be finding a way to do more with his family, especially Himawari, how can he even go a full day without an injection of that cuteness. \n\nKnowing this event isn't just some random mysterious power that appears is good, it establishes an importance that a lot of people wanted, but still gives me some great slice of life shenanigans between the cast which is my drug. \n\n"

As I said I loved how they explored the inner workings of other businesses of the leaf village. Filleryness is just a dumb way of describing it I guess since I can't think of another word honestly."
