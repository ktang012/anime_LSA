[The simple Wikipedia article isn't very helpful, alas.](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform)\n\nBasically through some properties you can convert derivation and integral operators and rewrite a differential equations as simple algebraic function. Essentially derivation becomes multiplying by *s* and integration becomes multiplying by *s^-1*. The resulting equation is very easy to manipulate through addition and multiplication. \n\nThen, using algebra, you rewrite your function in one of the standard forms (you'll most likely have a [table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Laplace_transforms) with them) that are very easy to solve.\n\nI've skipped quite a lot of details (and I might have made some mistakes), so don't expect the above to serve as a crash course. Can't really use Laplace transform without understanding Fourier transform, which in turn requires to know how to use complex numbers in frequency equations."

With \"seinen\" they would probably think of *Monster* or even *Gantz*.\n\nSeinen magazines are choke-full of *slice of life* series, and those ones are the ones getting more often than not adapted to anime.
