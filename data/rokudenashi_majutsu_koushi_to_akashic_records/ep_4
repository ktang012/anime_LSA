For instance with a single action trigger you need to cock the hammer manually. If the hammer is not cocked the gun won't fire and there is no point in cocking on an empty chamber.  \nFor dual action the hammer cock can be part of the pull, but that makes the trigger weight much heavier which in turn makes an accidental discharge all the less likely. Again no point in cocking on an empty chamber with a dual action either."

With the exception of Sistine (who is perhaps the only actual \"character\" in this so far) and Rumia (who's a perennial Princess Peach personality, assuming that can be called a personality), the characters seem to be or do whatever the plot requires them to. Sometimes Glenn is intelligent, othertimes he seems to be an outright moron. Sometimes weird cult lady is eager to fight and sadistic, other times she seems eager to stay in the background (which that *could* be hand-waved away as \"the mission takes priority\", I guess, but that's unsatisfying). Re=L seems to switch personalities on a dime as well - Glenn's talk-no-jutsu seems to be more powerful than even Naruto's. She also seems to switch combat effectiveness on that same dime, which the other characters are at least consistent with. "
