Assuming you are very physically fit and are used to wearing armor, it is definitely possible to swim in even a full suit of armor... at least for short periods of time.

That's heavy, for sure, but not an insurmountable obstacle for someone with enough training. If they ended up fairly close to shore, they should be able to swim to safety. I mean, assuming that they are trained soldiers used to wearing that armor. A normal person would drown pretty quickly.\n\nI mean, swimming was one of the 'seven agilities' knights in the Middle Ages were supposed to be capable of, even in armor.
