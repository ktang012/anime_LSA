The storyline now indicates that it is time to save Rumia once again, but this time Albert will join in. Being so calm and composed, stoic yet calculating, his match against the crazy witch/necromancer Eleanor was the highlight of the episode in terms of magic dueling. Still, I liked how subtle the subs spelled Riel's name as Re=L for a while now, only to introduce Project Revive Life to strengthen speculations that Re=L was involved in that research likely as a test subject. Can't help but to think that possibly some of the mages at the Lab of White magic are allied with the evil Researchers of Divine Wisdom based upon the grounds of ethical research. Creating Chimeras in reality would definitely be unethical treatment of life by the PETA and among other humanist organizations, but nothing as unethical as  sacrificing many human lives to attempt to resurrect one life... \nEpisode 8 I'd rate 8/10 for doing a complete 180 backstab to the protagonist. That was hilarious, out of the blue, yet quite expected due to her mental state. "

   "text": "This whole silly Re=L drama is by far the low point of the show so far.  I guess she's a \"copy\" from that Project Revival experiment, but the whole moping and \"They took him from me, I hate them!\" is just plain annoying.   And then, after already trying twice to murder Glenn, she does it again.  Are we supposed to be surprised?  \n\nFirst the organization tries to murder Rumia then the appointed murderer decides to kidnap her instead, then they try to murder her again, and now they're trying to kidnap her again?  Make up your minds already!\n\n[OK then.](http://i.imgur.com/IZes14c.png)"

   "text": "Episode overview (in real time):\n\n- Angry student fails to express reason for anger, takes it out on classmates\n- Teacher fails to explain situation to confused classmates\n     - Teacher also fails to warn classmates of any potential mental/mood disorders exhibited by troubled classmate (as hinted at in previous episode)\n- Blonde student catches a foreboding glance from tour guide and is visibly concerned about it, but then fails to express said concern to BFF or professor\n- First ever mention of a project known as \"Revive Life\", convenient timing with the appearance of Re=L\n     - Also definitely no similarity between the project name and her name\n- Professor explains that Re=L has the mindset of a child, and that students should accept it and be patient with her\n- Resurrection is stated to be impossible\n- Resurrection is proven to be possible immediately afterwards\n- \"Loving\" brother easily manipulates angry sister with ridiculous guilt trip - didn't even take him a full minute\n- Easily manipulated sister runs professor through without any hesitation or second thoughts\n- White cat hesitates to save her best friend because she's literally just that - a pussy\n     - Seriously, good job saving your friend when given a free chance\n- Dudeman somehow broke free from his fight, retrieved Glenn's body, and returned it to the hotel all in the same amount of time it took Re=L to knock Rumia out and leave\n- Glenn finally stopped breathing - god knows how he managed to last that long in the first place given that he'd been run through by a greatsword, literally through his heart and lung area, an instantly fatal wound - can't wait to see how easily they bring him back (or \"copy\" him, as it may end up) despite necromancy stuff not being possible since no catalyst\n- White cat also too wussy to administer CPR to someone who's been run through\n     - Finally does, but then no chest compression, wtf are you even doing?\n- God knows where they ended up or how long it took them to get there\n\nIn summary, everyone's too damn stupid to function as a proper team.\n\nFun times.\n"
