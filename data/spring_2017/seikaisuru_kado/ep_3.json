However, when you look at it, his sudden transformation and the parallel that was made in this episode with human life being an instant tells me that ZaShunina just became human. \nI mean, since the last episode he got violent, he lied, but also felt remorse in this episode. ZaShunina felt more emotions within this 2 last episodes than within the whole rest of the show. \nIMO, he turned like that because he absorbed some informations from the human world, enough to become human himself in a way. It is said just in the beginning of the episode when the singularity is here that when they absorb the information there's some kind of aftertaste or something like that.\nI might have interpreted that too much but this anime has enough content and good writing to do so.

Despite the unexpectedly [high dosage](http://i.imgur.com/9nRfVGB.jpg) of [cheese](http://i.imgur.com/161oH1y.jpg), I found myself liking it. The first half especially looked great; it almost felt like [2001: A Space Odyssey](/s \", from the perspective of the advanced alien race. The parallel continues since zaShunina wants humanity to evolve and move into the anisotropic, thus becoming his equal. He views these cocoons as breeding grounds for intelligent life.\")  The small sequence showing Saraka's childhood was also pretty sweet.\n\nAs for the second half: I feel like zaShunina's viewpoint is being unfairly shafted by making him behave in an 'evil' manner - it would have been better if there was a proper debate about the pros and cons of mankind ascending their own universe. _Of course_ the right answer is that they aren't ready, and they wouldn't remain the same once they left the mortal coil, so to speak - but maybe it would be an interesting experiment to bring _one_ human to the anisotropic? How about a (arguably) disposable clone? [2001](/s \"A Star Child, essentially.\")\n\nAnyway, all that is shoved aside for a good ol' showdown between 'right' and 'wrong' (Kado just _had_ to [turn black](http://i.imgur.com/hjhHvq0.jpg) to emphasize this), and Shindo is the collateral damage. It's fine though, because he got to [make out](http://i.imgur.com/ZDtIO5u.jpg) with the Fan-Goddess-Creator of this Universe - and [also wake up next to her half-naked form](http://i.imgur.com/5lkQnXV.jpg) after what [he thinks must've been a wild night of partying.](http://i.imgur.com/lQ8kKFe.jpg) (That was a legitimately hilarious look on his face, though.)\n\nAnyway, now that all that is over with, I hope next episode will go back to a more mature narrative that the first half of this show seemed to be hinting at. Even if it doesn't, though, it's not a complete train-wreck. It won't be amazing, but it will be decent."

And now, when we know what zaShunina means by \"the right answer\" (which is essentially forced evolution and submission) the disappointment strikes hard. Not only it killed the duality of the topic, it also made zaShunina a rather boring \"villain\" (or should I say \"antagonist\"?). They basically gave the answer for the viewers of the show and showed who was actually right, killing any thought about humanity's natural evolution and embracing higher technology. Now it's straightforward - zaShunina is bad because he doesn't listen, Saraka is good because she learned sympathy ([really?](http://i.imgur.com/HWmg2SV.jpg)) and Shindou is in the middle of it being an unfortunate victim.

It's like if your friend lived in a super small apartment so you decide to invite then over to your big house. The thing is, he doesn't seem to understand that making a copy of a person when they don't do something you want is morally wrong. You have to remember he's not human and doesn't completely understand life, while Tsukai has been with them from the start thus giving her a far better understanding on why this is wrong. After he injures Shindo and at the end of the episode though, it looks as if he's feeling some sort of regret. This is more than likely a effect from him spending so much time with Shindo and reading about 'friendship', I mean practically every story talks about friendship in some way shape or form. I think this is a reasonable conclusion to come to considering the fact all this information has been making him act slightly human lately. All in all, I believe he is doing a bad thing, however, I do not thing he's trying to be a intentional villain."

We'll never know what was right--and what was the right answer--for our whole lives. But even if we don't know, we just have to keep looking.\"\n\nThat ambiguity behind what qualifies as \"the right answer\" is the real meaning in the title, I think. The \"right answer\" for zaShunina (and maybe the rest of the anisotropic beings) is bringing humanity into the anisotropic, but that doesn't mean it's the right answer for *us*. \n\nAnd if Shindo does return and put a stop to zaShunina's plans, I don't think the show would be just giving us the answer, unless it involves rejecting all of the anisotropic gifts unilaterally. That would be saying the right answer is for humanity to succeed on its own merits. But if humanity can keep them, it would be saying that the only right answer is for humans to maintain free will and find the answers themselves, and I don't think that's a cop-out. "

This is as \"more\" as it gets, we already have 40 dimension universe, Gods that create other universes probably for fun? And then we have humans that randomly spawned in one of those universes. This reveal has also been foreshadowed for like the last 5 episodes.\n\n\n> His logic is sound, but it's also his impatience\n\nIt is not impatience, we still do not know everything. We do not know if humans will ever be able to go to the anisotropic because there simply is a very low number of dimensions in our universe and this number won't change even in the future. Thus if it is now or after a billion years is irrelevant. zaShunina also said that a transformation of only 1 person is enough and I think we still do not know why that person must be Shindo. The purpose of his \"presents\" is still not clear."

Lots of manga and anime, even 4koma gags, follow this structure, and I think Kado is no exception.\n\nThe trick is in whether we've hit the biggest twist or not yet, and there's one more major one that could be thrown in: zaShunina, feeling the complexity of emotion firsthand, decides that it would be more fulfilling to live as a human. This would recast the \"right answer\" as something different from just leaving humanity alone or forcing them into the anisotropic: humanity wasn't the one with the problem here, so they didn't need an answer."

Bloody brilliant, beautiful and imaginative.    \nGood job there Toei.    \nAlso,\n\n[](#emiliaohdear)\n\nShindo, you dog!\n\n***\n\nNow,    \nLet the nitpicking begin!\n\n[](#shitposting)\n\nSo essentially 5 anisotropic beings - Ki, Wa, No, Sa, To (unless I missed someone) were in charge of creating or simulating our particular *information* cocoon and they stumbled upon something they labelled as an *anisotropic singularity*. Now,    \n* If this singularity was in terms of *mass* (as the dialogue suggests), then, what does humanity have anything to do with it?    \n* And if this was an *anisotropic* singularity, why do they have to go into a lower dimension for observation? (because, you know, it is an anisotropic singularity)    \n* Furthermore, why is the dialogue between anisotropic beings so.... human? With emotions like a sense of danger and wonder involved? When zaShunina came to Earth, he clearly didn't posses those *concepts*, then why do these 5 beings do? What do you mean *touch* the singularity?    \n\n***\n\n[](#angrypout)\n\nI hate when a series starts off so good, but the creators start getting lazy as it progresses (or outright give up on it and just do whatever). zaShunina being portrayed as \"evil\" is such a cop out. Not to mention the whole giant weird anisotropic blade he pulled out. Just use that Nanomis-Hein and disable Shindo. Or just materialise one of your *creepy disconnected arms* inside his chest and squish his heart, or do it in his head and squash his brain. Piece of cake. No need for such flashy shit. And it's not like you need something like that to intimidate Shindo, he is fully aware of your capabilities (I don't think I need to talk about the whole stuff with Tsukai).\n\nAnd just what is up with the impatience? Seeing the first few minutes, I can tell that the anisotropic beings perceive time differently, billions of years are nothing to them. Why is he being so pushy all of a sudden? What happened to all that ramble about proper *information exchange* and getting your point across properly?\n\nJust what kind of books did you make him read Shindo? I bet they were History books about war. No wonder he just went from \"you should do this, this is good for you\" to \"I'll fucking obliterate you if you don't do as I say. Can't you see I'm trying to help here dammit!\"    \nMaybe zaShunina is trying to act like a human. Because that is the *human* way of doing things after all.\n\n[](#nyanpasu)\n\nThe worse thing that can happen at this point is that some anisotropic police shows up and arrests zaShunina (maybe one or more of those 5 *beings* in the beginning). Because I have no idea where this show is headed to now.    \nIf you just wanted to show a *good vs evil* play then why bother with such an elaborate setup about logic, evolution, science, talking about things like the impact of alien technology on humanity.    \nWhy the heck do they have to forcefully shove this dichotomy in every single show? \n\nIt makes me sad (and angry) to see such brilliantly executed 8 episodes go to waste like this."

   "text": "This is a show written by Japanese people. The  Judeo-Christian \"good vs. evil\" cliches you think you are seeing, aren't there. There is no \"God\" (as in the creator of humans) in Kado.  When Shindo asked if he was God, zaShunina never answered. zaShunina isn't a god. When tsukai gave her \"I love humans\" speech, she explains humanity wasn't created by anything, it just happened on its own.  Also, there is no \"devil\". zaShunina has no desire to control humans, just make them like him. The devil never wants humanity to be on his level, always beneath him.\n\n zaShunina's only sin is  that's he's screwing with Zen.  In Japanese, anisotropic is represented by these kanjis \"\u7570\u65b9\". The first kanji can mean \"unusual/strange/dissent\" and the second means \"direction/person/way.\"  Anisotropic is not of nature and considered \"unnatural\" or \"sinister\" by Japanese thought. Being so the Japanese audience knew zaShunina was \"evil\", right off the jump. With Zen anything not of nature is essentially the anti-Christ.  It's natural for men to sleep and for energy to be limited. To get rid of sleep and make energy unlimited is to not natural. Therefore, not Zen. \n\nTherefore zaShunina is the personification of man's desire to beat nature. Tsukai is either the personification of man giving up his ego to harmonize with nature  completely or personification of nature  (the show isn't over, so I can't be sure which is right).   Japanese philosophy is a strive for harmony with nature, not to overcome it. This is what Zen is to the Japanese. So zaShunina is wrong not because he's \"evil\" (i.e. denying God's authority in Judeo-Christian terms) but \"wrong\" because he's not \"at one with the universe.\" \n\nShindo is essentially Buddha or the model of the perfect Buddhist monk. Throughout the show, his thought process is similar to this Buddhist quote:\n\n>\"Do not accept anything on (mere) hearsay -- (i.e., thinking that thus have we heard it for a long time). Do not accept anything by mere tradition -- (i.e., thinking that it has thus been handed down through many generations). Do not accept anything on account of mere rumors -- (i.e., by believing what others say without any investigation). Do not accept anything just because it accords with your scriptures. Do not accept anything by mere suppositions. Do not accept anything by mere inference. Do not accept anything by merely considering the reasons. Do not accept anything merely because it agrees with your pre-conceived notions. Do not accept anything merely because it seems acceptable -- (i.e., thinking that as the speaker seems to be a good person his words should be accepted). Do not accept anything thinking that the ascetic is respected by us (therefore it is right to accept his word). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

   "text": "I think the problem everyone has with this episode and the anime's turn for the worse, is that the anime's set up lead us to believe that they would do something different. Up till now, zaShunina was likely to be the villain if there was the villain, they even said immediately upon coming out of the cube for negotiations and whatnot \"I want you to always be deciding whether I am friend or foe, that, is the right answer.\"\n\nThe thing is he was such a good villain that had his own honest intent on a subject that is new and refreshing : Is it worth letting humanity damage itself irreparably for the advancement of the human race? Even if we lose our culture, is it worth advancement? Or rather, Is it worth denying advancement just for the sake of culture, and all things of human construct that we might lose.\n\nzaShunina was on one side, and Sayaka was on the other. Shindo was an interesting character because he was somewhere imbetween the two. He, just like i think alot of us would say, values our culture and what makes us human but at the same time we're willing to sacrifice some of that for the greater good. Advancement is also important. I thought at the end of last episode this anime really had a good idea on how to make interesting interactions between characters and even though zaShunina had a sword they wouldn't go full on fight scene shounen style. What i had hoped was that he would fight them, they would convince him that he was wrong, he might take a strict stance on it but realize some part of human beings that was important to save, in this dimension, I thought that sayaka would declare her love for shindo or something and zaShunina would see that, act all confused, and then realize that he shouldn't just go typical villain all-out \" I promise the destruction of the human race then. \" But he kinda did. That's why i think everyone's disappointed, they had a really good shot at it, and they decided to go this route with it. I still think that they can pull it off and it'll be better than some other anime this season, but it definitely can't be the best anymore.\n\nThat said i really am looking forward to more of this. I don't know how they could pull off a season 2 but I want to see at least 4 more episodes, not 1-2."

It's legal in many countries because the people who opposed it died out. New ideas, new life, new anything often needs old stuff to die or be destroyed. Mass preservation leads to stagnation.\n\nSo you could see it as the old argument that human life is precious because it's short. But given that Saraka is someone who witnessed first hand the death of countless species and the rise of new species to replace the old.

Sometimes change can happen even if people don't die.\n\nOften you just need to \"remove\" someone from the system in order to remove their influence, death is not necessary.\n\nAnyway, if you listen to the anisotropic girl, even if she doesn't say so directly, that's pretty much her message, that life shouldn't be messed with, and the anisotropic being shouldn't interfere. Basically, it's the equivalent in real life as saying \"we shouldn't play god\" or similar.\n\nI dislike that way of thinking.\n\n> \"without death, the earth would still be full of jellyfish\". \n\nIndeed, might have been necessary for evolution of new species to fill niches that wouldn't have been available otherwise, but that was when evolution relied mostly on random chance.\n\nNow we have intelligent humans, and we can drive evolution ourselves, we don't need species to go extinct to create new niches and habitats (or to destroy them), we are above the mercy of nature.\n\nEvolution will happen/is happening much faster to humans, now that we know how to edit our genome, to alter significantly our environment, to automate our work, both manual and mental, we are transcending the limitations of animals, I think this fits quite well with the anisotropic coming to earth, giving us those gifts, it's like we were giving them to ourselves, he was just accelerating events.\n\nBut now they decided to make him evil, and act like a murdering fucker obviously, so all of his other ideas are instantly invalidated, and suddenly Saraka becomes the obviously good moral choice. \n\nThat's bullshit.\n\nThere is no value in Death. It might have been needed to \"free up\" space for new species for evolution, but now it's just the end of an individual and all of their potential potentially forever.\n\n"

   "text": "Tbh I was really disappointed in how things are going in the show, but hey, I'm not the writer. Maybe it was my fault for placing too much hopes on this show. \n\n1. I like the opening song, but I'm quite annoyed that Saraka is always there. Plus her ramblings in episode 8 (seriously, that was a waste of episode, it can be summarized in a few minutes) now makes sense. Now my fears happened, she did have a huge part on the story and it's kinda in a deus ex machina kind of way. \n\n\n2. Why does she need to kiss him? Dammit, I don't want romance in this show! I'm even tempted to ship zaShunina and Shindo since it's cute, but I didn't because I was so ecstatic when this show started (\"Yes, finally, a show for adults! Very interesting story! It's scifi! No high schoolers and silly antics! This is a serious show!\")\n\n\n3. My hunch about zaShunina being some sort of a god (okay, let's call him god anyways) came true, and Shindo's mother's words resonated in the episode: he's kind of lonely, and wants someone to be with him (not in a sexual way okay), and he chose Shindo. \nOf course, he's intelligent, open-minded, articulate. You won't get bored talking to him for hours or maybe for eternity (and of course, I want my own Shindo too lol). However zaShunina's actions these past two episodes are kind of inconsistent to his past ones. He's too eager to get to his objective (I'm guessing it's most likely because there's only two episodes left, not because of his \"personality\").\n\n\n4. Why do we need to have a shoujo heroine here? I'm sure I'll be downvoted to hell since too many people here like her a lot, but where's the negotiation? Okay, fine, granted that zaShunina became violent towards Shindo already, but are we to consider at this point that the negotiations have broken down already? \nShindo's principle in the earlier episodes of doing things that will benefit/satisfy both parties had been shown over and over again in the earlier episodes, why does it have to end to this shounen-like battle of sorts?? If we look at how some governments handle peace negotiations, if there is violence happening already, a ceasefire will be called out, and negotiations will resume. Where is that?? But then again even if it will happen in episode 11 (which is unlikely given the current state of things in episode 10), there won't be enough time to wrap things out nicely. \n\n5. I was hoping for the story to unfold in a way that there will be a side effect on using Wam and Sansa, and there will be turmoil. zaShunina will see no issue to this, since he knew that not everyone will be able to transcend into the anisotropic, but Shindo will reason him out of it, and will convince him that humanity is not yet prepared. zaShunina will express his impatience, that given how the humanity had progressed, it will take a hundred or maybe a thousand years before they could be ready, so he tells Shindo that this is the only way. Shindo disagrees. Some people will start voicing their objections to zaShunina's presence and force UN and the Japanese government to act on it. \n\nzaShunina discloses the 4th item, and Shindo will experience the effects of it. He will say that if humanity will not cooperate, then he will only need one. And Shindo will choose to go with him.  \n\n*Well, my version's kind of lame, but that will totally avoid the shoujo heroine and shounen battle scene thingy, and will keep the storyline rational. If we remove the whole Saraka monologue and her childhood flashback thingy (I really really like the birth of the universe scenes though, so breathtaking!), then we'll have more time to flesh things out with less tropes and cliches. I'm interested to know how other people thinks the story should go. What's your version? \n\n"

There were some more that I've forgotten but China is only recently beginning to put out better anime. Some of the older stuff you will find is really bad.\n\nWhile the new shows like QuanZhi are not the greatest shows of all time, they clearly show a huge budget and are up there in terms of raw entertainment value.\n\nI would recommend watching the 3 anime I mentioned in my first comment by the way. If you like Kingdom, read the manga too, since the anime was kind of botched a bit.\n\nThe problem I had with Seikaisuru Kado is that it never aimed to be a trope-y magical fighting anime featuring shy blushy love and nakama power, which is where it now seems to be heading. If this had been the objective clearly from the start, I may have set different (not necessarily lower) standard as it could have been done well."

RIP me.\n\nBasically, there's a lot of things the series is doing right as of episode ten, but there's a ton of shit it's doing wrong as well, and I'm at the point where I'm seriously concerned that there won't be a narrative payoff at the end of Kado.\n\nThe series has been struggling hard with its portrayal of grey morality in the case of zaShunina, with the most recent slip being it's apparent pitting of his humanistic ideology against Tsukai's naturalist ideology... but just putting all the chips in Tsukai's corner by portraying her positively over and over and over again. (They actually do this to the point where their efforts to make Tsukai look appealing to the viewer kind of wreck the consistency of her character, which is a shame). In comparison, zaShunina has always been portrayed as suspicious, even while he's doing pretty awesome things like fixing the world's energy crisis or offering people a broader understanding of the universe they live in. (Granted, his misstep in episode nine was FUCKING HUGE, but you also have to consider that he is not fully socialized and probably has difficulty grasping tougher philosophical concepts like the self, the soul, death, and morality.)\n\nSo the setup they have now boils down to \nTsukai=Naturalism=Right=Good\nzaShunina=Humanism=Wrong=Evil\nand it's so boring. The series really seemed to be invested in exploring larger ideas, and the writing at the start was so promising, so these narrative decisions have been a massive disappointment. It's got a couple more episodes to resolve this in a way that would conclude the story arc they've set up in a satisfying enough manner... *GESTURES NOT SO SUBTELY TO PROTAGONIST SHINDO, JAPAN'S TOP NEGOTIATOR, WHO EXISTS OUTSIDE OF BEING A TROPHY FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR* ... but as of right now the missteps in writing aren't giving me a lot of hope that they'll even be able to do that."

If saraka really love humanity she will know it's for the greater good but it's not all the humanity she loves.. it's her circle of friends lol she just want to continue spending their days together or maybe she just want to live out as a normal human and doesnt like change"

   "text": "WAY TO DROP THE BALL, KADO.\n\n[Last episode I said it was going to shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6g8ll3/spoilers_seikaisuru_kado_episode_9_discussion/diomlbe/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=anime), and it went through shit right into super shit territory.\n\nIt's like they were rooting for ZaRaka to become best girl, but it didn't happen, obviously, so after 8 episodes they realize that and decide  to go all in and WHERE THE FUCK DID THAT KISS COME FROM SERIOUSLY WHAT THE HELL.\n\nIs this star wars or some shit? The stakes are way too high for all this romance drama.\n\nI mean, it's not like we didn't know. Let's confess: we knew. We knew it. We saw it coming. We knew the show was going to become garbage. We had this feeling it would happen sooner or later and we were just hoping that could be delayed as much as possible. As soon as the autistic \"researcher\" girl was introduced we all knew it was one of those series that mix VERY BADLY good ideas with boring over-used crap. We pretended the girl was a pandering thing, a mascot. That she wasn't representative of the good show that was kado. But deep down in our hearts we knew it was actually a crack in the sweet caramel shell that let us see the turd of the story that was inside, and here we have it.\n\nJesus fuck, ZaChina, gtfo of this sci-fi anime and go into some BL anime instead. This forced homo crap is depressing. It's like, you have these god-like creatures who live in anisotropic limbo or some shit, and literally the only thing they can do is act like full-blown retards who want be happy-happy friends with everyone. Why do they act so dumbly? Just... why.\n\nImagine Uchouten Kazoku. Imagine a prideful tengu. Imagine Nidaime, that BAMF. That's what ZaChina should look like. Someone who's got all bases covered. Someone who knows how to do shit. Someone who doesn't fucking cling to everything and acts like a goddamn child. Someone you know is from a superior dimension because he acts like he is from a superior dimension. WHY IS THE ANISOTROPIC BEING NOT A TENGU? WHY?!\n\nI'm sad and disappoint.\n\nGood thing they rolled the credits and made it look like the series ended this episode because we might as well think it has and drop it now. That's what I recommend. I'm not dropping it because I'm stupid and I want to believe this can somehow redeem itself just like I did when Biba got introduced in the Tranwreck anime. Well, the Trainwreck anime didn't get better. This won't get better. I know it. I have a serious problem.\n\nUntil next week folks."

The starting sequence was nice, did not like how they communicated like humans, unless that was just a translation of whatever complex mode of communication they had which our tiny human brains can't understand.
