   "text": "You know what people say?\n\n[**Dreams come true**](#doggo)\n\nDat freakin' Scandinavian.\n\nEdit:\n\nI'm glad the cat is out of the bag, and the girls finally know [Yoshino visited Manoyama](http://imgur.com/QsktL0x.jpg) in her childhood. And whom better than anyone else to point that out than Shiori, the most motherly & perceptive of the cabinet. I'm thinking maybe this info will leak to Takamizawa in the future (or probably he does remember young Yoshino) and it will help out Yoshino in a future event where she will need outside moral support.\n\nLoved the very [first scene](http://imgur.com/gz6Al5F.jpg) with the girls spirit being all pumped up and Riri just being Riri. And Shiori doing the [glasses tilt](http://imgur.com/2WVHdlj.jpg) gave me a good laugh. Silly Riri, I thought she was wearing that [kitsune festival mask](http://imgur.com/0dH2WbX.jpg) out of being shy in front of the camera, but it looks like she was just being Riri.\n\nSpeaking of Riri, one thing this show does pretty well is continuity. That remark of why [Riri is part of Yoshino's cabinet](http://imgur.com/jkpAu5o.jpg) and the reinforcement from her that [she likes Yoshino](http://imgur.com/GoAAK0t.jpg) because she gets her is just golden. I'm glad they also mentioned [Moe-chan](http://imgur.com/V8jM2o5.jpg), and she didn't become just a disposable prop character.\n\nThe moment I saw we were going to \"The real world\" kind of format, I knew someone had to try to [stand out](http://imgur.com/bWapFks.jpg) in front of the cameras (my first choice was Kadota) but I never thought [Erika](http://imgur.com/LOj9Eer.jpg) would be the one; and of course she has to spice her TV image with her normal [sassy attitude](http://imgur.com/PtcFftI.jpg).\n\nSeriously, I'm thinking [Sandal-san](http://imgur.com/X42pvRU.jpg) is just prowling around with a bunch of props in a big bag, from musical instruments to sporting goods, waiting for the right moment to jump in and steal the spotlight.\n\nThis arc seems it will be focused on Yoshino. Man I'm missing [Sanae Bae](http://imgur.com/MndjXdm.jpg) getting some quality shots in the show.\n\nFocusing on the mainplot of this small arc. It's interesting Manoyama is going to get a lot of attention from the outside with this upcoming live event. This of course will also bring some internal strugles due to budget. I'm a bit on the fence with [these producers](http://imgur.com/HJEiVWU.jpg), I understand they live on chasing and sometimes making these dramatic stories happen, and it's a [win-win](http://imgur.com/9UcMArI.jpg) situation for them and for the townsfolk. But at the same time it brings some struggles to an already conflictive comunity. I'm glad at least that Riri's grandma is supporting this call without feeling forced into it like in previous events that have not being completely satisfactory to her. It's quite silly how the stuborness of townsfolk can even cloud their judgement, getting more visitors from the outside will help out their economy even to a simple bookstore. There will always be people interested in uncommon books not found in the big cities or rare first editions they might have in their inventory.\n\nWith all this upcoming attention on Manoyama and her [lovely cabinet](http://imgur.com/O842QTT.jpg), I'm wondering..  [Pure Speculation](/s \"if there will be a future opportunity for Yoshino to work elsewhere due to her recent popularity, and break appart the team for drama purpouses\") Edit: It's the first time I really notice Yoshino is the shortest in the group, even shorter than Riri.\n\n\nMan, with Eromanga doing a crossover with Oreimo, my cravings for a crossover with other P.A. work shows (particularly Shirobako) just grow on me bigger and bigger with every episode. I know P.A. has never done something like this, but, there's always a first time for everything. Right?\n\n\n#EPISODE 11 OUTFIT COUNT\n___________________________________________________________\n\nNumber of Yoshino's outfits: 1\n\n[Yellow shirt and boxers pajama](http://imgur.com/ZoDZKy7.jpg)\n\n__________________________________________________________\n\nNumber of Sanae's outfits: 1\n\n[Blue shirt and boxers pajama](http://imgur.com/ZoDZKy7.jpg)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n#[WARDROBE SUMMARY](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/66b42x/spoilers_sakura_quest_episode_3_discussion/dgh1qya/)\n_________________________________________________\n\n**TOTAL OUTFIT COUNT SO FAR**\n\n**Yoshino** outfits: **14+1=15**\n\nYoshino variations: **7**\n\n**Shiori** outfits: **12**\n\nShiori variations: **2**\n\n**Sanae** outfits: **12+1=13**\n\nSanae variations: **1**\n\n**Maki** outfits: **12**\n\nMaki variations: **2**\n\n**Riri** outfits: **10**\n\nRiri variations: **1**\n\n\n______________________________________________\n"

After the introduction and the \"presentation\" arcs, now we're really getting cereal here. It's the biggest challenge [Queen Yoshino and her Revival Gal Pals] (http://i.imgur.com/oinfeqV.png) have to tackle up to this moment for fulfilling their quest, and surely is a strong way for finishing the cour. An anniversary, a contest, and a music festival put together? TV sponsorization? Manoyama's four communities acting together? This will be a blast.\n\nIt was nice to see how the Manoyamans acted in front of the cameras: Shiori trying to impress the audience with her glasses and [strong words] (http://i.imgur.com/eExhI5x.png), Riri [covering her face] (http://i.imgur.com/4AMMwHt.png) due to her shyness, Chitose showing herself as cooperative only for [this scene being recorded] (http://i.imgur.com/4rwVXvr.png), the other folks peeping through the windows. This feels so real.\n\nI also love how continuity is shown in this anime. I don't only mean plot and character continuity, there are also those little details. E.G, when Riri is asked what she thinks about Yoshino, she answers that *she understands her, therefore she likes her*, which is basically what happened last episode. \n\n**Ep 12: The Dawn Guild**: We got a fantasy simile again! It's lovely how these words represent a fundamental idea in this arc: unity and renaissance. The women not only work hard for the quest, they even managed to get agreement and help from the other boards and communities for aiming for the same goal, hence the *guild* factor. They're now like a proper organization working for the town's revival -*dawn*-, under Sandal's view.\n\n(Speaking about Sandal, [THIS TIME HE SPOKE OUT AN ENTIRE SENTENCE IN ENGLISH] (http://i.imgur.com/PeWLQul.png).

   "text": "So this mostly felt like a set-up episode, although it's pretty common for this show to have 2-3 episode arcs where the first episode contains a bunch of exposition and not much else.\n\nI did like Yoshino calling out the Board of Merchants at the meeting though. They're so critical of her efforts, yet her and the rest of the Tourism Board are the only ones putting in any effort to revive the town."

   "text": "I lost it at Sandal-san's unexpected Field of Dreams quote. XD\n\nWhy do I get the feeling the festival will succeed in meeting its attendance goals, but not in the way the girls would want it? The crowd are here mainly for the boy band and don't really care much for the town.\n\nAfter spending 2/3rd of the season on the other four girls, the show now goes back to focusing on Yoshino, who, as the Director so aptly puts it, looks rather bland compared to the other four.\n\nRiri suddenly becoming talkative once her switch is punched on is completely spot on for introverts. Getting them to talk can sometimes be like extracting blood from stone, but push the right buttons regarding their interests and they can chatter away like a river."

It's really really good.\n\nThis episode was fun, added with foreshadowing of some troubles ahead. The producer honestly seems like a good guy and I hope in the end, he does turn out that way. I know there will be some trouble but the gals will get through it ;)"
