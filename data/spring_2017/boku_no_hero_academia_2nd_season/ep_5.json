He has one of the most powerful in the series (also being smart and extremely driven helps a lot) in how ubiquitous it is and he uses it very creatively but we never, ever, see any downside to this. Compare that to Ochako who we see gets stomach ache and such from her quirk, Iida who needs cooldown time, Todoroki is a bit different as will be explained next, Kaminari...etc.etc. From the main cast he's pretty much the only one who we see suffer no consequences of how he uses his power, this scene is pretty much the only one and that's a \"Wow, that was close\" rather than any real consequence, it feels like lip service where a lot of the other cast have very real drawbacks which they have to overcome or work around.\n\nEspecially when used like this - I would say this is one of the weakest fight resolutions of the series, since even if Deku has to go full tilt for his power he suffers heavily for it. The fight itself is great, but this fight and this aspect of Bakugou always made be a bit disappointed since he has some amazing drawbacks which the other fighters have to overcome."

It is constantly misused on this sub and in general.\n\nFirstly saving the output of Waifu2x as a JPEG is counter productive as Waifu2x as it's designed to ***remove*** artefacting and other things that re-saving as JPEG introduces to provide a cleaner image with less noise, so saving it in a format that will add it back in afterwards is just silly. Please use PNG.\n\nSecondly, the Waifu2x'd version still looks worse than /u/Atronox's lower quality upload let alone the source version. So much detail is removed because that's essentially what Waifu2x does; removes grain and other artifacts which is great for simplistic anime images/scans, but terrible for intricate images like this one.\n\nWaifu2x is a fantastic tool, just one that needs to be used appropriately and this is not one of those times."

I still had the image editing program open in the so I could capture each step again using the undo function.\n\n[Here](http://imgur.com/a/bmewT) is the album of each step. I recommend scrolling through it while reading this.\n\nFirst I downloaded the original picture, then openend it up in GIMP.\n\nThen I selected the right cirlce, using the colour selection tool, I fiddeled around with it a bit so I only get the circle and nothing else. (aparently the transition between the light skin and shadow skin is actually a very similar colour)\n\nI then pick the colour of the light skin and use a big brush to go over the light pink section. This leaves a small pink border around where the pink circle originally was, I just fix that with a smaller brush by going over it.\n\nNow the area of the cirlce is filled a single colour, which actually looks quite weird. You could still tell where the circle used to be.\n\nI fix this with the repair tool, which lets me copy the \"texture\" from a different section of the image. So I use that to copy the texture of the area right of the nose and go over the border of the previous circle.\n\nI don't know what the real term for \"texture\" is, but you can think of it as small imperfections and colour variations that are present in large uniform looking areas. They are mostly introduced when converting something to a .jpg, if you scan something or in a photo.\n\nNow I do the same for the shadow part of the right cheek cirlce then the entire left cirlce.\n\nYou can actually still see where the border of the light right cirlce meets the border of the shadow right circle, if you look very closely. I totaly didn't think about that. I could have very easily fixed it using the repair tool again and copying the texture of the normal borders above or bellow the section.\n\nNow I actually also tried something I hadn't done before.\n\nThe shadow areas of the shadow cirlce on the left. Those had a slight pink tinge to them that looks natural in the original picture, but would have looked out of place here.\n\nSo I selected the pinkish area, set my brush to subtract mode, set it to a bright red colour and 8% oppacity and went over it twice to reduce the red colour amount in the section.\n\nI am really pleased with how that turned out.\n\nTime to remove a two cheek cricles ~8 minutes, time to explain how I did it ~50 minutes :D\n"

Uraraka wins within the first second.\n\nIf she makes herself weigh 1 gram, and the jacket weighs 1kg, pushing the jacket 1m/s forward would make her move 1000m/s, say they are 50m apart she closes in on him in .20s and smash out of bounds, faster than even Bakugo can react (theoretical human minimum in our world is about .80s). She's taking explosions right to the face so I imagine she'd live from such acceleration.\n\nMaybe the physics don't work exactly like that in the anime world, but weighing nothing there should be *some* way to make yourself go supersonic speed.\""

Her quirk is impossibly complicated in terms of physics. If something actually had zero gravity acting on it, you know what would happen? The earth's rotation would leave the object/person behind and it'd be creamed at several thousand meters per second against the first obstacle it meets, be it the rising ground from a slope or a building or a tree. But that's only with rotation. Depending on where the people are on the planet compared to how the earth's moving on its revolution around the sun, it's honestly pretty likely they'd just go flying off into the sky."

Uraraka wins within the first second.\n\nIf she makes herself weigh 1 gram, and the jacket weighs 1kg, pushing the jacket 1m/s forward would make her move 1000m/s, say they are 50m apart she closes in on him in .20s and smash out of bounds, faster than even Bakugo can react (theoretical human minimum in our world is about .80s). She's taking explosions right to the face so I imagine she'd live from such acceleration.\n\nMaybe the physics don't work exactly like that in the anime world, but weighing nothing there should be *some* way to make yourself go supersonic speed.\""

Too much G-force. To take a practical example, human cannonballs typically had a initial speed of 35 m/s, corresponding to around 12 Gs of force during the impulse.

Someone else brought up it might not [work](http://bokunoheroacademia.wikia.com/wiki/Zero_Gravity) - as it doesn't make her massless, gravity just stops working.\n\nSo... It might not work, it seems a bit ambiguous. How does gravity not work? Does she not interact with gravity because she is massless, or because it just doesn't work for some other reason? (we don't really know how it works in our world even...) When she through the ball during the physical test, she didn't throw it especially fast but it also didn't slow down from air resistance. However that would still be possible because the momentum is always conserved, her arm would just not slow down. So if she throws her jacket antiparallel to her and Bakugo, if could work... During the throw (immediately after making herself zero-g, which she would do during the push/throw of the jacket) she would start speeding up very quickly, and might not be able to even push it off at 1m/s because she started moving away from it. Maybe she could hold the jacket up and drop it then punch it.\n\nI doubt the ability is going to stay very consistent throughout the show. Anyways, magic is the answer to everything. Could it have worked? Maybe, because it's a magical superpower. Could it not have worked? Maybe, because it's a magical superpower that doesn't obey physics and doesn't feel like doing none of that shit.\n\n/u/Galle_"

If you double click a mouse its quicker than that, and this is kind of the same thing, turning it on and then off really quickly. Maybe that could be a further development for her in the future and she can finely control it to gain super speed and super jumping abilities.\n\nOr 100 other ways for it to happen depending on how it actually works...

The only other character with the amount of screen-time/personal connection/protagonist status to carry the tournament as a leading contender is Ochako and she got booted out. \n\nSo I think it will be:\n\n- Deku\n- Ieda (For that sweet Deku vs. Ieda action. There are no stakes if Deku faces plant girl, right? She's basically an extra. )\n\n- No way Bakugo loses to redundant quirk guy aka his own fan club.\n\n- Birb. Seems like he'd be a more interesting matchup for Bakugo. Will the day progress during these matches? It'd be cool if they wound up fighting at twilight/night time since it doesn't seem like the plot has delivered on his daylight/night quirk power. Bakugo is literally a human candle so that would be an interesting fight, where he has to exert himself to keep Dark Shadow illuminated. Could also be a curb stomp battle. But Birb is smart and I bet he will have a plan. IDK. \n\nRound after that:\n\nIf it stays daylight through the whole tournament, I'm pretty sure Bakugo will beat Birb, and while I really want Deku to win the whole thing but I can imagine a possibility where he loses to Ieda since Ieda is a longer standing character. And then it'll push Bakugo vs. Deku further into the future as a hook? But they already fought before so maybe it's fine if it happens again now. Who knows though. :/ It'd be cool if Ieda beat Bakugo but I can't even imagine how that would go. But if it's Deku vs. Bakugo I feel like there's no way Deku loses, because of Bakugo's rage issues and mental retardation and all. "

I just realised her face looks like [Deku in the previous episodes](http://i.imgur.com/S3EOQ1P.jpg)\n* Bakugou's \"What part was frail?\" is actually a huge compliment, showing he acknowledges her ability.\n* The manliest of all fights was finally decided. [I'm starting to think Midnight is into younger boys](http://i.imgur.com/ZoiHR6k.jpg)\n*  [I said it before but Deku makes the best faces](http://i.imgur.com/VAq2l5s.jpg )\n* We're finally getting [](/s \" SHOUTOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\") in an episode or so  and also [one of my favourite panels in the manga](http://i.imgur.com/undefined.png)\n\nedit: I also noticed when momona is saying what an idiot he's looking up at the sky.

I was even hoping for one of those come-from-behind shonen cliche wins, but I knew that would be a bit too much. She's totally best girl of the season now. Everything about her, her backstory, her personality, her quirk seems to suggest that she'd be taking a more passive, support role, but this episode showed her inner will and determination to be strong on her own. It was amazing how it showed how she wanted to win both for herself and for others. Her desire to win is mixed with her feelings of wanting to support Deku and her parents, so her motivation is both selfish and not, but in all the best ways possible.\n\nI guess this is a good thing. She gets to fail in order to build herself up even stronger than before. I like how aware she was of her own failures in the match, too.\n\nAlso the performance of her VA in the dub gave me chills. Seriously kudos to that person. \n\nI'm not too sold on Kacchan yet, but I have a sneaking suspicion he'll end up in the final. Oh well.\n\nDeku is turning out to be one of my favourite shounen protagonists. He has empathy, even for his enemies, even for Kacchan who bullied him mercilessly since childhood. He even stands up for Todoroki against Endeavour, the number 2 ranked hero. I'm seriously rooting for him all the way."

Deku went full savage af on your ass. I bet you're shook.\n\nAww Uraraka... You'll definitely be a great hero one day. The reveal of her parents' faces looked special and touching.

Everyone seemed to assume that Ochaco had no shot because she was a girl, and held it against Bakugo when they felt he was using too much force against a girl.\n\nThis makes no sense to me since there are Female Pro Heroes. You would think that people wouldn't have these shitty preconceived notions about what girls can or can't do when there are well-known Pros out there getting the job done.\n\nEven Deku seems to jibe at Katsuki, telling him that Ochaco was leading him around by the nose. Basically everyone in this episode was a sexist asshole except for Kacchan who treated Ochaco as a normal, equal combatant. He thought that Deku was the one to come up with the plan for her, but even that was likely more about his obsession with Deku than assuming that Ochaco couldn't come up with the plan because she was a girl.\n\nAnyway, just sucks to know that shounen battle anime continue to adopt the attitude that \"frail\" girls are just window dressing for the boys to be encouraged or amused by as they go off and become the real heroes."

BNHA's setting is consistently presented as, \"just like modern-day Japan, except with superpowers\", and any social changes we see are directly caused by the presence of those superpowers.

Going easy against her especially in a tournament would be fatal.  I can't wait for the next fight. I know she some people generally see her as the main character's love interest, but shes pretty a pretty damn good one.  Favorite one in the whole tournament. I think it next week since I skipped the previews. \n\n"

She achieves this when Bakugou accuses Deku of scheming up the meteor shower trick. Somewhat ironically, since the trick was so similar to what Deku would come up with, Bakugou was able to foresee and counter it, which ultimately lead her to lose. Regardless, since it was Ururaka's plan, we as the audience see the similarities between how Ururaka and Deku think in combat.\n\nReally awesome character development."

Uraraka wins within the first second.\n\nIf she makes herself weigh 1 gram, and the jacket weighs 1kg, pushing the jacket 1m/s forward would make her move 1000m/s, say they are 50m apart she closes in on him in .20s and smash out of bounds, faster than even Bakugo can react (theoretical human minimum in our world is about .80s). She's taking explosions right to the face so I imagine she'd live from such acceleration.\n\nMaybe the physics don't work exactly like that in the anime world, but weighing nothing there should be *some* way to make yourself go supersonic speed."

Even better than the manga IMO, the combination of music and visuals got me excited for this fight all over again, and it was amazing to see it all play out animated. Bakugo was awesome as usual, Ochako was adorable as usual, and both were really smart while employing their strategies. On Ochako's side especially there was some much needed development, showing how much weight she puts on her goal, and just how smart she really is. There was also the arm wrestling match which was amazing, the dynamic of TetsuTetsu TetsuTetsu and Kirishima is always hilarious. What I'm most excited for is next episode, though. They teased the fight and the emotional importance of it near the end, with Endeavor and Deku's talk, but it's seriously gonna be amazing. \n\nNext episode: tons of Todoroki development and action, and a really great fight scene. This fight is one of my top 5 in the series so far (probably number 3) and I'm really really excited to see it next week."

Don't you find it to be a bit unfair to bad mouth BnHA because of that?\n\nThat is a stupid way of thinking, awful practices don't become magically okay just because \"other people are already doing it\". \n\nFor example most politician sells out to private interest, does that make corruption okay then ?\n\n Now then :\n\n> This anime's basically godspeed compared to battle shounens of the past! You're just being overly impatient.\n\nNow other than it being done by others not making it okay, my problem here isn't the speed at wich the plot goes, it's the content within the episodes themselves.\n\nThis season of BnH A is blatantly content-starved : most episodes start with a recap of the world, add to that the opening and a recap  of the season, overall episodes start for real at around 5 to 6 minutes.\n\nThen you take into account the ED and the post credit silly 30 sec clip, you get episodes that are 15/14 minutes long instead of 20/21 for most other animes (QNZH/The King's Avatar and Boruto both follow this format) and you get a very significant difference in content.\n\nThen there is the fact that so far we've had a cliffhanger at the end of every single episode save one, wich gets tiring over time. Cliffhanger aren't a very good storytelling tool in the first place but when they're overused it starts to become exhausting and starts to kill the hype they're meant to build up artificially in the first place.\n\nP.S : Let me say that defending BnHA by making the argument that somehow I'm flawed and not the media and that's why I'm enjoying it less than other comparable animes is an ad-hominem and is the lowest possible level of argumentation. \n"
