Also when he opened her up to fix her, he opened her from her back in the manga and there was a part bringing attention to an important gear of hers that didn't happen in the anime, and he didnt get to stare at her boobs.\n\nAlso the very first chapter of the manga does a wonderful job of bringing you into the world and introducing the naoto and ryuzu. As well as giving a small preview of how much things will change. I cant recommend enough to just read the first chapter to compare."

   "text": "Oh boy, here we go again. *sigh*\nFirst, I want to say i read the Light Novels (Translated). So of course I am the Idiot who compares the Anime to the Original. Buhu. Something no one apparently should ever do, but I think the points I have with this are obvious even without reading the source material so bear with me. ^^ \n\nWithout further ado lets start why the first Episode of my most Anticipated Anime of the season is a total Trainwreck and hopefully just a bad start to a decent show.\n\nLet\u00b4s start with the Narration at the beginning of the Show. WTF. The Prologue of the Light Novel is also just Narration but hilarious simply because its premise is unique. Like they said the world ended ... but not in a way we all would expect. No. Scientist simply calculated the date for the end of the World wrong and because of this humans no longer have the resources to Trigger a war. The world is also perishing, but so slow that there is no real sense of dread so humans don\u00b4t Panic. It really just ends. No big Bang no last struggle just puff over. But then Y appears and remakes the Planet out of Gears. \nWhat does our Opening Narration do? It takes all that made the premise unique, dumped it in the trash bin, took the most generic part of the Premis and simply lay it over an Animation of Gears turning. Whop de F****** do. You had the Chance to Animate something interesting for this premise and you chose to not only be Lazy about Animating it (I know Animating is hard work but come on. Turning Gears! My Background was more work than this screen saver) but choose to butcher the setting.\n\nThen the part after the Opening with an Action Scene out of nowhere to show us what\u00b4s to come. Why? In the Novel they at least tell you why this happens [Spoiler](/s \"we don\u00b4t know when this scene will happen until Volume 3\") but we at least know that they are hunted because mere Minutes before they committed an Act of Terrorism by showing of their  [Spoiler](/s \"Power to Manipulate the Tower and thus Manipulate everything from Gravity to the weather\") Thus the Government is obviously out to get them. Making this whole scene much more comprehensible and giving us a reason to be invested in the Story. We want to know why?\n\nNext the Characters. Oh boy the Characters. Naoto did get zero Character building. In the Novel we start with his schoolday (in the Anime he comes back from it) where we learn that he is a total Nutjob. He has an Automata Fetish (like most of us After Nier Automata XD) and is a social outcast because he doesn\u00b4t interact with his fellow classmates. But he doesn\u00b4t care because 100% of his interest lies in Automata. What do we get here ... nothing. Comes Home, hugs a Clock, gets Ryuzu dropped on his Head. Even his special Ability his inhuman hearing, which makes him Interesting and which is important to the Story and his Role in Character Development of the Rest of the Cast, is simply checked off in a sentence. The Rest is okay. Ryuzu and Halter get theirs later in the Story and Marie is currently spot on (Here i hope they change her according to the Story and don\u00b4t keep her an ojou tsundere bitch like shows tend to do).\n\nThe Pacing. **** the pacing. No world-building and after Episode 1 we are 1/3 done with the first Novel. Why? Novel 3 has a perfect spot to end the Anime. You could have a 12 Episode show with 3 Novels in it and enough time to Build the Characters and World. This is just my Theory but it seems they want to cram all of the available Source Material in this Anime.\n\nMusic: Meh Op is Generic ... it may grow on me. Only Time will tell. The ending is good. Quite liked it.\n\nAnimation: Cute but can\u00b4t hold a stick to the Original Art. (Of course, this is not possible for an Anime but hey ... a man can dream)\n\nFazit: I really want to like this show, but with this first Episode I fear they don\u00b4t understand what made Clockwork Planet different. Of course, this could turn out like Dance in the Vampire Bund who had a horrible first Episode but the Rest of the show was (IMO) decent. I give them 3 Episodes to show that they understand what this show is about. If they can\u00b4t, I won't drop the show, but I will only stick around to see the Train crash, burn and explode.\n\n\nSorry if this long text is weird to read. English isn\u00b4t my first language and it\u00b4s currently 2 a.m. Have some mercy. ^^\u00b0"

I'm a fan of both but the anime does each arc in a different order for what seems like no reason and the much darker serious characters in the manga are toned down and given some comedic parts. \n\nOverall, I think they're pretty hit or miss for this and was pretty surprised they chose **Clockwork Planet**. They did a lot of the older anime that I still love today like **Love Hina, D.N. Angel, Mahou Sensei Negima, Softenni, To Love-Ru**, etc. Basically anything that awakened my youth. \n\nIf you want to continue with the anime I'd recommend not reading the manga or lns first."

I read the manga and there you can kinda excuse it because of the medium, but here definitively it needed another take on all this information. For example, if they had given those 3 minutes of them fighting at the beginning and used them to introduce Naoto properly, we may have known in a more natural way about automatas.\n\nI felt we where moving at 3.000.000.000 kph during the episode. I felt the pacing was really fast and the story wasn't breathing as a result. Ergo, not much time is given to the characters for us to care.\n\nThe animation needs a bit more work, as so the backgrounds.\n\nTalking into positive things: I liked how they used the CGI, i think it is well used and blends well within the episode. Other than that, the setting is interesting, but that is more of a merit of the LN than the anime itself. Lastly, the plot seems interesting. I had read already a bit of the manga but I didn't went enough to reach to the point of the Military getting rid of Kyoto. It seems promising. At least I am also glad that Naoto isn't the only genius this time around, blondie-chan also is a natural born genius. For these reasons I'll keep watching this show, but it needs to pick up the quality by a lot."

It's more like \"Transport man 1 and 2 are so unimportant, that they aren't allowed to know how important that package is besides the other ones, so it was possible that exact that package got lost. During this, it felt in the radius of a boy who is special in some way, but exactly because he is special, we follow his story, otherwise we wouldn't be interested in him.\"\n\nRadius because his special ability \"hearing\" is of course stronger than only 5 cm, so in a radius of X km, it was possible that he \nshould find the package, it's not important where exactly because he could hear the nice melody and would be irritated, in this case it felt directly on his position. \n\nAlso he never knew what exactly he did to RyuZU, he only knew that he want to do anything, again, if he couldn't repair her, there wouldn't be any reason to follow his story. \n\nI am quite open to every premise, as long as it stays true to itself, because there has to be a reason we follow know the story of this or that character. \n\n>  A show's pilot has to reveal enough of the premise in such a way that it presents itself as actually good material\n\nThis is of course a true sentence, but a \"good material\" is identified by its characters and the different ways a story can go. \n\nI have to say that the adaption isn't as good as it could be, but after reading half of the book, you already forgot the \"opening\" (in the book it's not really the opening) and has fun with great written characters and a nice story.

I also wish they had explored the clockwork aspect of everything a little more as that is the main reason I came here. Yes I know that kid just performed heart surgery on a robot but that's not enough to satisfy me. Maybe if the robot was animated to feel like there was truly clockwork going on beneath her skin then I would be happier, because as it is now, she moves just like an ordinary anime character.\n\nAlso I hope none of them ever say anything about meshing or I'm going to get Hand Shakers flashbacks.\n\nI did like the ed though.
