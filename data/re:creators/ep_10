She also fills the Gilgamesh role of OP antagonist who at least acts like she knows more than everyone else\n\n* Yuuya: Berserker, though probably with a low rank of Mad Enhancement, like E-Rank maybe\n\n* Mamika: This ones hard because we already have a Caster which is where Magical Girls would normally fit in, she doesn't really fit any of the extra classes either, I could see an argument for Archer though, and just assume that Military Chuuni is like Gil in S/N and doesn't count towards the base class count"

Each a universe projected from our earth (prime).\n\nI think Military Uniform Princess comes from the realm of Pixiv and crossover fanfiction. Her creator Setsuna created her to be someone with the power to travel between different series and worlds (like Kamen rider Decade) She tried to bring this series to public but it was bashed by the industry for being reliant of other creators work and was banished. saddened She committed suicide unknowing that her work resulted in the creation of Military uniform princess(alive). Because she came from cross overs she doesnt have her own world/ home and can only travel between them until she finds our earth prime. Finding out about the world, her fate and her creator she decides to destroy everything.\n\nI think whilst MC's sister wrote the story and the character of Military Uniform Princess. It was the MC himself who drew her/ designed her. Maybe he was young that's why he forgot about his creation or her sister setsuna modified a doodle from her brother into her. I think this is the case since this episode we were introduced to Selestia's drawer. proving that there isn't necessarily only 1 designer/ god for each character.\n\nEdit.: My other theory is more simple. Military Uniform Princess was simply written like that by her creator. Shunned and banished she decided to write a character/ story to channel her inner hate and anger of our world and the industry using one of her brothers designs. But did not know she created Military Uniform Princess (alive) the creator committed suicide. So Military Uniform Princess was designed/ programmed to do what shes doing now."

Souta writing up these events makes Military Uniform Girl become a main character and could make the story popular (covering the 'needs to be popular' requirement). Military Girl brings people to a world where Souta hasn't written her yet in which he gets movitated to write about this.\n\nThis would be basic writing theory for dealing with time travel: For Event B (Military Girl goes to Real World) to happen, Event A (Souta writes about Event B) needs to take place. In order for Event A to happen, Event B needs to take place. And now we have a basic time loop.\n\nNow how do I do the jump from just story to this is a anime about a anime.\n\nIt's pretty much established that popularity needs to be a factor for being able to be send to the real world. Combine that with this likely being a story about Souta using these events to write his own (see time loop), there is a good chance what we are seeing is the finished product that becomes popular in order to enable Event B to be possible.\n\nRegardless of whether this theory turns out to be correct or not, god damn I like this show. There is so much to analyse about writing."

Illustrator-san was really excited and Celestia seemed to enjoy showing off.  It was cute.  Other than that nothing happened and we didn't really learn anything we didn't already know outside of character revision not being all that straightforward.   \n\nGoing forward it looks like we will have two factions that the future characters will join.

It should be hard to accept that her choices aren't real, and are just products of her creator's imagination... but if she believes in something like fate then maybe that amounts to the same thing.\n\nThe experimentation and interaction between creator and created was great though. Particularly when Souta suggested that ideas have to be canon, or at least known by the populace at large, to change the characters' abilities. Meteora is the smart character of the group but she might not be familiar enough with how fiction and fandoms work to think about this, but it's something any creator or major fan would have thought of immediately; while she was talking I was thinking Souta really ought to contribute exactly that just before he did so. The team needs someone who suggests summoning a flaming sword indoors isn't the safest way to do an experiment though...\n\nI think what I'm hoping from this show the most is interesting commentary on the relationship between stories and the real world, how they affect people, and how stories are constructed, and the anime looks like it's going in that direction, but the pacing is really slow so far. I was expecting a lot more action. I don't know if I prefer this approach or not; it's including a lot of things that interest me, but it's not doing so in an exciting package."

At the very least, it's information about the default future if she didn't know anything, so knowing that future is at least as good as a [Peggy Sue](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/PeggySue) fic. With time travel, even though the timeline would diverge based on your actions, the knowledge from the first time around is still useful.

Predictions of an extremely likely future are absolutely worth knowing... if you're not just going to roll over and accept it.\n\nThere are various reasons why one might suspect it won't be useful.

Then again there attempts to change her by adding new elements in this episode didn't work at all so maybe it is impossible to add new elements now that she is in the real world."

It would actually be pretty interesting if later in the story we get to meet light novel Selesia and she begins to talk about elements of her backstory the anime Selisia has no idea about.\n\nOf course a good chunk of that goes away if the impression theory is true. However there are ways of testing this in story. What we saw in episode 3 was the characters writing a short story and making an illustration to go with it. Now this test ultimately failed but what if they got more people to see this story. It actually wouldn't be that difficult, just have have the author post a link to it on his twitter account with the illustration they made. Since this is in universe a very popular anime airing right now this would get a ton of attention from the usual news sites and a lot of people would check it out. It would be very interesting to see if this had any effect."

Setsuna is the new name and someone brought up here that she might be the girl that killed herself which follows through when the military girl said that Souta was *part of the world that banished you*. \n\nThis is theory crafting but I'm guessing Setsuna's death was also the reason Souta has trouble drawing; those two were probably close considering the military girl knows Souta pretty well.\n\n\nI'm curious to see where this show will go since 3 episodes aren't really enough (then again, the 3 episode rule is a guideline and not a parameter to begin with).\n\n "

Just because the anime hasn't caught up with the source material, doesn't mean that the seeds for those future events in the source material aren't in that anime universe or that the anime universe doesn't change to accommodate the new information created when a new LN is released. I don't think Selesia's experience is reliable enough to go on because she's still a character in that world and wouldn't know every thing that's happening in it.\n\nObviously the Creators *can* change the characters and their world. That\u2019s the whole point of the villain\u2019s motivation and this anime would go nowhere if it weren't the case, so I believe it's possible for Selesia to obtain that new power. But just writing the new power wasn't enough and having an illustration along with some context wasn't enough. Of course it wasn't going to be as easy as \"I'm going to give you a new power\" and she could suddenly use it.\n\nI think the key that makes the idea real is the connection to a large number of people like they were saying later on in the episode. They help subconsciously fill in the complex details that make it possible for the fictional world to actually exist. It ties into Meteora\u2019s explanation of recollection when Marine was surprised by stitching in Selesia's clothes. I don't think the Creator's intentions alone are enough, it's the connection with the hearts of the fans that make the fiction real.\n"

Almost all the characters didn't go beyond their archetypes (with the only exception being the bad guy who turned out to be kind of nice and interesting), while the creators are just boring people to follow as you'd probably expect them to be.\n\nThe show has a lot to prove in the next few episodes. It touches on some interesting concepts, but I'm not sure it will be able to explore them properly. One worrying sign is the show telling us how the LN author outlined the world view of the heroine very well. But we don't actually see it. Arguing with the creator is one thing, but other than that she acts like a super generic fantasy LN female protagonist. Is the show going to tell us that LNs like these feature well written characters? In most cases they clearly don't.\n\nI also don't like how the illustrator immediately buys the idea of the characters being the real deal.

Does each route get a world?\n* Is there a world based on Candy Crush?\n\nThe more I think about the meta-physics of the show, the more confused I get, but it's still a very entertaining show. Personally I'm leaning more towards the worlds existing independent of any actions of the inhabitants of our world, and some people just receive information about those worlds and create fiction based on it.
