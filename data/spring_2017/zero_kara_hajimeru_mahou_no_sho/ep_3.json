They are idiots who betrayed Sorena's wishes, and are just a militia who just kill for nothing with the excuse of wanting peace.\n\nI might be getting this wrong, but wasn't Thirteen going to be a martyr if his plan succeeded with the SoZ killing him, thus breaking the contract and killing themselves?\n\nThe only fault this dude has is that he can't take a hint, she's not into you dude.\n"

For every heinous deed that he is accused of by the Best Matress Ever^TM he provides logical reasoning and counter points in order to explain why they were necessary or that they weren't actually his fault. This is good and well, but what really sells Thirteen is that his logic is just a thin veil for his true motive, giving Zero her chance at fulfilling her childish dream. \n\nWhile his methods and, ultimately, his actions were condemnable, Thirteen is a perfect representation of my favorite anime villain archetype.  An obvious genius with little emotional capacity that commits heinous crimes in order to prop up the one thing in which they have emotional capacity for. "

   "text": "Well, right now I would give it a 7/10, which in my scale it would place it as a good show, but the only way it is going to be memorable for you is if any of the show themes resonate with you. For me it had good development at times but sadly I forgot most of the episodes and what said episodes where dealing with, especially in terms of themes all the way to narrative and storytelling.\n\nIf you like anime that is episodic in nature, then you may enjoy it more than other people, since most of the episodes are highly episodic by themselves. Nevertheless it has an overarching plot that in theory should move in the background, but the highly episodic nature of some episodes do nothing to move forward said plot. There are almost no stakes, and I could argue that there isn't even a villain until, if I remember well, the third episode of the second cour, somewhat around episode 15 if I remember well. \n\nCharacter development and progression go with various degree of success, with some being a failure. Sadly, again, part of the cast have at best one episode for them, besides Diana which is a special case and has more than one episode. Sadly, again, for me, besides the MC and Diana, the show failed to make me care enough for the others, and the other cast once their episode comes and go, they are moved to the background in a pretty painful way imho. I would argue that once their episodes come and go, you could take them out of the show and nothing would be different.\n\nLWA, as I said before, has pretty good moments where you can feel the weight of the scenes and it moves you, but overall I see it and I can't shake the the feeling of the potential it could have had, and of course lament that it didn't reach that height. Don't expect another show in Kill La Kill quality because this show doesn't have it.\n\nLWA needed more work in its story, and a focused execution on a show that has an overarching plot since that what in the end they where going for, and it is the product we are watching now. It needed more time to weave better the story, make it more tight, connect better the characters, develop them more, make them more relevant to the story by them holding direct influence on the story, and overall develop every aspect of the show from \"Good\" to \"Great\".\n\nAs it is now, most of the cast are just quirks, with the exception of Diana, Ursula and Akko. The stakes, honestly, are non-existant, so you will have a harder time to relate to them when the action comes around. Most of the episodes aren't relevant to the overall plot and you may easily forget about them, as it is what happened to me and many others.\n\nThis show is good, but it definitively doesn't have the drill to pierce the TRIGGER heaven and take its place besides Kill La Kill (The top Trigger show imo) and be remembered for many years to come, for most of the people will see it."

   "text": "Well, think of it as the difference between a comic book and a movie based on that comic book. Everything happens almost the same, but certain elements are changed in order to fit the media better. \n\nFor instance, we get a more detailed explanation of sorcery and magic, which could've gone an entire episode. The dynamic between Mercenary and Albus is more entertaining, resulting in the latter feeling less like a third wheel. The role that the Sorcerors of Zero played in starting the war is explained better. Thirteen's character is explained in more detail. Holdem is played more as comic relief. We also get a lot of internal monologue from Mercenary.\n\nSome sequences are also injected, such as the whole scene with the barmaid in episode 7, and the fight between Holdem and Mercenary in episode 3. The whole exchange between Holdem and Mercenary is given a few short paragraphs in the novel. The mechanics of beastfallen going feral are also different, and introduced at a different time. Most of episodes 2 and 4 don't happen. The flashbacks from the first 6 episodes never happen.\n\nThere is, overall, less violence, better characterization, and more concrete explanation in the light novel. I get why they made these changes in the anime: it wouldn't transfer well. However, it interferes with canon a bit more than is welcome. I often see people confused at how stuff is explained in the anime and just shake my head. I honestly hope the light novel or anime get licensed someday.\n\nIf you're wondering, the manga follows the light novel extremely closely. I wish I could recommend it as well, but it's quite far behind, and the fan translations for the first three chapters are *terrible!*"
