I don't think the anime depicted it really well but in the manga All Might's speech during the cavalry about what separates the top heroes illustrated the similarities and parallels between Deku and Bakugo. \n\nI initially also hated Bakugo but post-Sports Festival arc is where he really starts to shine (but might I add it started after his first defeat to Deku).\n\nI kind feel stupid having to explain this but he's the Vegeta to Deku's Goku, the Kaiba to his Yugi, the Sasuke to his Naruto, etc.\n\n>He is absolutely pointless and one-dimensional.\n\nNo? I already stated examples where there was more to him being an asshole. Other people also brought up his respect towards Ochako during their fight. \n\n>Also why even Deku is such a pathetic idiot and considers him a friend? \n\nHe doesn't and you saying that just shows how much you've misunderstood their relationship. *Deku idolizes Bakugo*. He worships and respects his quirk and he recognizes his talent and drive.\n\n>Bakugo is a bully for the sake of being a bully.\n\nAlso wrong. Bakugo is a bully because he's arrogant, has a shitty attitude and was led to believe his whole life that he was destined for the number 1 spot. His heart is still in the right spot otherwise he wouldn't be in the Hero course or wouldn't have treated Ochako the way he did during their fight. It isn't excusable but the nuance is important. If he was a bully for the sake of being a bully wouldn't be at UA but rather with the villains."

But I love now how Kacchan is kind of working his way back in, you almost forget *just how fucking strong* kacchan's quirk is. \n\nAlso my favorite fucking thing is how much kacchan is developing. And why is he? Because of Deku. He's made kacchan AND todoroki so much stronger than they were, and more-so for kacchan's end because of the crazy strategist that Deku is so it's made kacchan have to think more, use his head instead of just being the hot headed power freak anymore. I fucking love it man. Seeing him fully coming into his own, showing us that he's actually quite fucking brilliant with the rest of the other top strategists in the show, I just love his development. \n\nHonestly man I just love Saturday's so much. Hero is becoming one of my favorite anime's EVER. It's actually insane..I didn't even know if I'd like the show after the first couple episodes. So I'm glad I stuck with it. But seriously I'll wake up and watch Hero academy, text my brother about what happened in the show and then we just chat back and forth for a bit discussing plot points, etc.  Always awesome having some family members who have similar taste in anime.

The only use of intelligence involved in that is that he realized dark shadow is weakened by light, hence his use of stun grenade.

BUT, you also have to think in terms of what All Might believes in and stands for.   \n\nAs dangerous as it is, what Deku is doing is the essence of a hero.  Someone who sacrifices everything to save others in a truly altruistic fashion. Think back to the first episodes where Bakugo was getting attached by the blob villain. All Might stood back lamenting that he couldn't do anything because of his condition, while all the other heroes made similar comments. They put self preservation ahead of saving someone. Meanwhile Deku, a kid with no quirk, runs in to help without even giving his own well being a second thought.   \n\nEven thought Deku talks about wanting to be a hero and wanting to live up to All Might because he's so cool and whatnot, when it comes down to it and shit is on the line Deku rushes in to save someone without hesitation. He saved Uraka during the entrance exam without thinking about his score, he jumped into save Bakugo when he was attacked, and even during this tournament he was more concerned with helping Todoroki overcome his own demons. When it comes down to it, saving others is a natural reaction to Deku.   \n\nHow do you tell a kid to stop acting like a true hero?"

He hurts himself, Recovery Girl fixes him, and life goes on.\n\nBut then you have moments like Aizawa stopping him from throwing the ball and is like \"dude, you can't keep going all out and expect someone to just magically fix you.\" So, Deku has to come up with a new solution right there on the spot and he does it. Not only does he display his quick wit, but he even manages to genuinely impress Aizawa which, from the looks of things, no other student in the class had done up to that point. That in and of itself is a feat to behold.\n\nWhen Deku ruins his body *again* after his fight with Todoroki, not only does Recovery Girl try to explain how dangerous it really is (i.e. \"I can't fix everything and sooner or later you're going to beyond any help\"), we also get more insight into Deku and All Might's relationship. It is in part *literally* unhealthy for Deku with how much he looks up to him. He is destroying himself because he doesn't want to let All Might down and by All Might encouraging his actions up to that point, it made Deku try even harder. And Recovery Girl is pretty much like, \"no, stop it. Not this time. You two *have* to get your shit together.\"\n\nIt's just such a small, but meaningful thing. Horikoshi could have easily turned into a running gag where Deku hurts him, he goes to see RG, and wacky hijinks ensue, but no.

You give him All Might's (i.e. this universe's Superman) physical abilities without any downside and you're left with an incredibly boring hero right out of the gate because he's perfect too\n\nBy making Deku so vulnerable early on, not only do we get to see how he matures over time, it gives *plenty* of room for other characters to shine which helps keep the story interesting and varied. We aren't just waiting for Deku so solve every problem and/or always be the one to stand out.\n\nI'll buy that Recovery Girl is arguably a cheap way to get characters back into action, but she exists because of Deku and his limitations.

This episode adapted the later half of chapter 40, 41 and the first half of 42. Interetsing to note there's a good amount of anime original scenes here. Iida's fight against Poison Ivy was only mentioned in passing after the fact but the anime showed off the fight. Iida's brother pursuing Stain before being taken out by him is also anime original. Probably my favorite extra scene (tho more of a shot) is the glimpse we get of [the previous One for All user, aka All Might's teacher](http://i.imgur.com/S6G8GT1.jpg) who we aren't meant to see until later on. Works well. \n\nThat said though, looking over the manga I'm kind of confused. [Manga](/s \"The manga mentions that \"he took me under his wing\" implying that All Might's predecessor was a man, aka Gran Torino who is indeed his teacher, but we're shown Nana Shimura in the shot who is his actual predecessor, the previous user of One for All. Maybe at that point in the manga Horikoshi hadn't been certain that Nana would be a character? The anime mentioning his master passing OFA onto him seems to be anime original as well as its not in the English volume.\")"

That's not to say one language is better than the other etc, just that it's easier to get away with it without it being too obvious. In addition Japanese relies more on context than English so being vague is just more common if you don't know the context. Japanese does have words for him and her they just aren't used as much I guess, at least in my experience with the language. \n\nEven pronouns like 'I' which in Jap do have versions which are gendered (Boku, Watashi, etc) aren't specific so much as they are historical? They are more masculine and feminine versions of the same word but both genders can use them."

What that would imply is it's a sort of reserve of energy within a person they use to empower themselves. He said that if he gave it to Todoroki it would empower his Ice and Fire.\n\nNow, Midoriya and All Might have the same powerset because they were both quirkless, meaning we can look at them to understand what One For All actually does.\n\nI believe One For All is a cache of potential energy stored within the users body, which both All Might and Midoriya charge up and expel as Kinetic Energy. For example: the bouts of wind pressure from bodily movements can be explained by a sudden release of kinetic energy from a point. This also explains why One For All appears to be a simple \"Enhancement\" type quirk, because it's EXACTLY that, it enhances.\n\nSo, without a Quirk, all All Might and Midoriya have to enhance is their body. I feel like this easily explains why Midoriya is breaking his bones, if he just had super strength he'd be fine, it's the blast of kinetic energy firing from INSIDE his arm that shatters his bones. \n\nJust some speculation as to how the power works. Since (In my world anyway) One For All grants you a huge swathe of potential energy, if you can naturally convert energy with your quirk it would affect that. Todoroki could create more extreme temperature, produce more heat energy, etc etc, someone like Bakugo would literally get more bang for his buck with larger explosions, Dark Shadow would likely become more light resistant etc etc.\n"

I can't wait to see more Hatsume Mei, Mind Control dude, Iida, Dark Shadow. Hell, even people who lost quickly without getting offense in could lead to some cool character development down the road like the 2 girls Dark Shadow eliminated.\n\nIf this were a 1-cour ending next week, I'd probably have an issue with the pacing since I'd likely forget most of what happened by the time next season comes out (like I did with S1) but as it is, I see it as a fantastic showcase of a dozen main characters plus a dozen good secondary characters leading into the second half of the season.

   "text": "Horikoshi does a pretty good job with avoiding typical shonen tropes if they would hurt his story. I'm not saying he avoids shonen tropes entirely, but when he does use them he's careful to make sure that they fit and actually enhance the story. Nothing in this series is ever done \"just because.\" There's always a reason or purpose. That's what I really like about this series. It doesn't abuse shonen tropes, but it also doesn't avoid them just for the sake of avoiding them. They fit in naturally and nothing has ever made me roll my eyes due to not fitting in to the story.\n\nIn a typical shonen, the main character would constantly go all out and win through sheer willpower and then suffer no consequences. But in this story, our main character suffered heavy consequences for his rashness, which will cause him to learn from his behavior and grow as a character. Even his mentor was mostly at a loss for words. He did his best to cheer him up but he knew that Izuku needed to learn an important lesson about his behavior and his defeat. In a typical shonen, Deku would have woken up with a smile on his face about the good thing he did for his classmate, and how there's always next year. But his reaction after waking up from the fight was far more realistic once he realized what he actually did. And then All Might helped him come to terms with it by explaining how his decision to help his classmate was far more heroic than winning the battle would have been. This was a realistic exchange because it was the more experienced person who came to that realization and used it as a teaching opportunity.\n\nAll I'm saying is that you shouldn't apply generic shonen tropes to this series. They'll still appear where they fit in, but they won't happen just to happen. Just because something happens in most tournament arcs doesn't mean it has to happen for this tournament arc. That's not the kind of series this is."

When most people flex their muscles, they just look a tiny bit bulkier. All Might is just *so powerful* that when he flexes his muscles it looks like he transforms into an entirely different person. But One For All doesn't actually transform him. That's just him filling out his physique by being in a state of constantly flexing every single muscle in his body, hence why he can't sustain it for very long. He does use OFA's power in order to find the strength necessary to flex for such a long period of time though."

Talking about the draft *this year* when you're watching a bunch of first year students leaves me to believe that maybe students can leave school early to apply for the draft. I'm so curious as to how that works. I know in sports, there are rules to drafting in order to keep things fair (e.g. the worst teams draft first) but I doubt they'll follow the same rules when it comes to agencies. Agencies probably have a limited number of spots for students to be sidekicks, though.\n\nI love the structure of the superhero world in anime (as opposed to western media where becoming a superhero means slapping on a costume and going) and I really wanna see more of how it works.\n\nI think I might start reading the manga."

For example, let's pretend Momo (the girl that can create any physical object) has a child with some guy that has the power to create light (kind of like the glowing baby that was the first quirk user). Their child could get either of the parent's abilities but it could also get a fusion of the two abilities. In this case, they'd be able to create objects that are made out of light, pretty much like Green Lantern.\n\nTodoroki is just an example of a hybrid quirk that behaves like two separate quirks.

It shows how everyone can excel in their own way and how a simple tournament or test isn't always the best way to rank people. If every single fight had been drawn out to be at least ~5 minutes then it would have been worse in terms of pacing and the point they're trying to make about tournaments/tests. \n\nRemember Aizawa's comments about how the test to get into UA is horribly unfair for certain quirks, such as Shinso's mind control quirk? And then here we have a tournament set on an open area in the middle of the day where the easiest win condition is to simply ring-out your opponent. Neither of these two scenarios can grant a fair and comprehensive judgment between two characters. Some people excel in an open combat area like Todoroki and Bakugo. Others would have benefited greatly from having cover such as Momo who would have had more time to create things or Tokoyami who could have tried to find some shadows/darkness to hide in to strengthen his quirk. \n\nBut they're fighting in an unfair environment with extremely easy win conditions so it only makes sense that all the super quick fights took heavy advantage of that. A quick burst of speed to push someone out of the arena or a fast assault from Dark Shadow to do the same. Even Todoroki almost lost to Iida if he hadn't been smart enough to freeze his engines. Speed and being quick on the offensive grants a huge advantage in an arena like this. It only makes sense that the fighters that took advantage of this were able to score such quick victories."

Especially the girl with the vine hair, it seems quite strange that she seemed to sneak into the bracket when she seems to have had no real significance whatsoever, getting beaten by Iida instantly with no real idea of what her plan was to fight back (though I don't know if she's important to anything to come). As it has been said, though, these fights barely even existed in the original manga, and there's only so much that Bones can expand upon it, so I appreciate that they did their best to try and make them more entertaining, and there's no doubt they're doing a great job with this show."

But the second the steam clears and they see Deku out of bounds, they just decide that its fair to let Todoroki win A FIGHT THEY INTERFERED WITH AND TRIED TO STOP. That doesn't seem right to me."

Ochaco should've won their match, she completely outsmarted him and he should have lost because of it. \n\nI don't like that he's won all of his matches simply by relentlessly blasting his opponent, and the matchups were simply just all favored towards him doing that. He doesn't know that those are his opponents weaknesses, he has no strategy, and wins anyways. It's not satisfying or interesting imo.\n\nIt obviously fits his character, but I'd have liked to see him challenged sooner rather than later, his current character hasn't really developed aside from his encounters with Deku now having a quirk. He's remained basically the same since the 2v2 nuke battle. \n\nSidenote: Stain looks DOPE AF. I'm a sucker for a good \"badass with a sword/dagger\" characters. I like that they are also adding more people without quirks to the cast (at least it seems he doesn't have a quirk, or his quirk relates to his choice of weapons prolly)"

Thats why he's so OP compared to most the class, and why there isn't really anyone to challenge him. "
