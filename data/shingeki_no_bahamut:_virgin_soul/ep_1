Despite having all the stone slabs that supposedly contain the blueprints to construct the Dromos, the gods still chose **not to construct it** even though **Bahamut was already beginning to awaken** in the first season. That alone is a testament to how dangerous and powerful it is.\n\nIt's also interesting how Gabriel mentioned that the world of Mistarcia had some sort of extremely high-tech progenitor race that existed before the gods, demons, and humans did, which was responsible for designing the Dromos and presumably the basis of the tech that the gods use, as well the creation of these ancient \"stone slabs\" that Gabriel also mentioned. \n\n# **SO.

I would like to think that this mystery person hates the gods and demons and wants the ancients ones to rule again.\n2)  the onyx knights are these mysterious people who know of the plates . Considering that we don't know much on how you become a onyx knight so my only guess is that they are some secret order from a tribe. \n3)  this is the least of my speculations: Charoice is a desendents of these ancient plate makers. Considering we don't know much of his past exept for a few things here and there. Maybe this is how he got the onyx knights to fallow him and it would explain why they are so dedicated. Maybe they are both desendents and it would explain why they know of the plate tech and how to put it together.\n\n\nI know some of these ideas are really out there but I have a feeling that it might just be something more simple.

They can't be just ordinary humans considering what Gabriel said about how even if they stole the plates they couldnt put it together. So it has to be someone who is neither human nor god nor demon.

The humans are really wrong because they didn't take the high ground after being on the bottom for all this time. The humans shouldn't have tried to get back at the demons by making them their slaves and destroying their homes. The humans also shouldn't have went out of their way to destroy everything related to the gods while also hunting them.

We saw her grow familiar with the rest of the cast and the people from the city. We also know that she did not belong to any of the warring sides, the angels, demons and humans because she\u2019s a dragon and was therefore confused about her position. She fell in love with a tyrant and has now seen what he is capable of. She\u2019s at the moment even traveling with a person who was unfairly imprisoned and whose son said tyrant has threatened to kill. She needs to wake the fuck up. \n\nI feel like her appearance in the OP really summarizes her role throughout the entire first cour. She\u2019s on the ground, naked, confused, embarrassed and then she turns into her dragon form while the men fight and get the spotlight. She\u2019s the main character for fuck\u2019s sake.\n\nSo my guess is, if her character will be done justice at all, that the second cour will revolve around her personal growth. Her going back home might even be the start of her new arc. She gets to go to her parents and tell them all she has been through and will probably be judged on her growth so far. If we are lucky, her mother will probably call her out on that weakness of her and her silly teenage crush on a man that has a lot of growing up to do himself. We saw from Favaro\u2019s flashback to the dragon village that dragon women are pretty tough and aren\u2019t swayed by meaningless flirting and charm. Hopefully Nina will toughen up a little (she gets to spend time with the badass that is Jeanne too!) and find her resolve about what her role is in the conflict that involves all of her friends."

   "text": "Love can be a weird thing and sometimes even we don't know why we love the people that we do. It was clear as day that she hated the king through out this series. She fell in love with Chris and I think it goes beyond physical appearances. Maybe she likes his charm or maybe they connect on a spiritual level. However when she found out that they where one in the same person let's just say hot and cold mixing together will cause a storm. \nNina's Character is definitely taking this into mind which we see through her actions and dialogue. She is confused and I think anybody would be. But what I got out of this episode is that yes she is confused and angry but still is in love which has more realism than most anime I've seen dealing with love. \n\nTo be honest I'm not some fan of the show who is into the shipping. If the show was going to market a romance between her and Azazel' s Character I would have been fine with that. As long as the characters where invested then I'll be invested as well.\n\nHowever, the writers of the show did something new that don't ever really seeing in anime or even movies and TV shows today. I find it very interesting to make the protagonist fall in unknown to her with the antagonist. \nI don't know why I love this set up and I think it's  that way for a lot of fans for this show. \nI think it might be because it's complicated and different and not straight to the point. It's not that dull cutsy holding hands stuff you seeing in even thing these days. In some ways it's werid.\nI seen alot of anime where the main lovers are with each other all the time to the point where it becomes tiring to see them. Yah they say nice things to each other but that's doesn't matter unless you got me the viewer invested in it.\n\nI think these are reasons why people like my self are invested:\n1) different romance formula.\n2) .Nina's well rounded goofy personality vs  Charoice' stern mysterious. \n3) it's complicated\n4) story that is resembles \"a farewell to arms\" novel which is about a tragic wartime romance.\n5) attractive Character designs: I'm not going to lie this probably plays a big part."

   "text": "I'm not criticizing the romance, which by the way is nothing new, at least in Shoujo, there's plenty of heroine falls in love with antagonist plots. What I am commenting on is Nina's personality, which I also have nothing against. I absolutely agree that her reactions so far have been understandable. What I'm trying to do is figure out what's next in the story. Nina can't remain the same throughout the story. I want Charioce and Nina to end up together, but I want them to grow and change before they do. So far Nina has been naive and basically in the middle of the storm, that's not a bad thing as long as she doesn't remain like that the entire time. There is a lot of potential and that's what I'm looking forward to. However Nina so far has been like Mugaro, seen as a weapon by others (completely dependent on who's using them) and even in this episode she had to rely on Charioce to hug her in order for her to stand up to his army. I have nothing against that because we are only halfway through the story, but I'm trying to be positive that Nina (still the cheerful and bubbly Nina) will grow out of that and that she won't remain the main character that needs men and to be hugged in order to be strong.

But I 100% agree with you on her character growing in this story.\nThe only thing that we seen so far in  Character growth is be able to control her body a little which is still growth. I mean she did have to learn to control her emotions in oder to do that.\n\nBut yes I don't like seeing her used as a tool. Even Jeanne is using Nina to an extent. But what makes Nina's Character kind of complicated is that in the beginning of the story she already had a goal which was to make money for her mom. In a way she already knew what she wanted in life for the present situation. Kind of like Favaro in the first season they are Characters that are satisfied with their current situation in life and arnt looking for change until someone brings it.\n\nBut even when someone brings change and they are on Thier grand adventure  even at moments notice they wouldn't mind slipping back into their normal lives. Like how we seen Nina getting comfy with prison work life and not even trying to escape until Jeanne wants to. Or with Favaro wanting to return to bounty Hunter life as hard as can when he was with Amira. \n\nThese are a really werid set of Characters that you mainly see in films. Like Han Solo wanting to go back to his smuggling life which Favaro is like. They are heros set on the heros journey that don't want or don't care to be on it. It takes a big thing to change them and it's usually at the end of the story.\n\n\nIts hard to draw a line with her character of being used to help her friends or being straight up used like with Azazel. I don't see her need to help the demon's cause because it conflicts with her making money. I mean if one thing is clear she is not really in the side of humans from so far what we seen in the series lol. Which is a little werid considering that she had a close relationship with those towns folk.\n\nBut yes she need some Character development and make her own decisions for once. But hey there is one thing that she decides on her own. And that is who she loves lol. I can't wait to see all the reactions on her friends faces when hey find out. But that's not really Character growth."
