But now that Nomura is \"no longer hers\" She feels as if the only plausible change of course is...to kill him and everyone who surround her.\n\nGuys, I'm not gonna lie, Amou is my favorite girl. I have a thing for Yanderes. But aside from that, I like how she's portraying herself. Next episode is gonna be explosive, but bittersweet.\n\nAlso, I wanna point out, although yeah blatantly obvious, but just how FAST Amou's emotion got stirred up when Nomura professed and just yelled that he hates her. Nearing the end of the episode she was clearly sadden, but that \"sad\"-esque feeling got changed into pure anger and resentment, clearly a fit emotion to tear Nomura up.\n\nOh, and for reference, I'll give this show a damn good solid 8/10. For sure. Love it, even though general reception is average.\n"

Everything could've been gray, then the only colored person to walk in was nomura. We can walk back into present time and everything is still in her POV. We could see the fight, the background is gray, the rain is gray, only nomura would've been colored. Then whenever we saw her body it would also be colored!
