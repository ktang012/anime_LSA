Because this kind of peace is relatively new to the Narutoverse, Konoha hasn't come up with an efficient way to handle the increased load of paperwork, hence a lot of it falls onto Naruto to manage.

   "text": "Another episode I thoroughly enjoyed. Like Metal Lee's character, wish we'd seen Rock and whoever his mom might be though.\n\nAs much as I love Boruto's character, I kind of wish Shikadai was the protagonist, you can have so much fun with home life and just the way he's picked up a head for strategy from his dad (run away being the oldist trick in the book though).\n\nOn the point of strategy, that was a really well done one as I felt myself following along with Metal, this has always been something I enjoyed about Naruto as a series is it's able to convey battle strategy in a way that blindsides me but still fits within the confines of the prior established rules. \n\nLike we know Boruto can create 3 clones, so once we see 3 taken out we know the real Boruto is hiding somewhere, from there it skews the perspective of the viewer and hides the true intentions of the fight. Just really well done in my opinion and I look forward to more. \n\nI see a lot of complaints that these characters are just rehashes of their parents and I disagree, I mean first up most of the previous generation looked the spit of their parents anyway so it's already an idea set up from the original series, and secondly it would make sense they take some traits and ticks from their parents (Shikadai's what a drag being an example). But if you actually watch how they hold themselves, how they speak and how their personalities reflect and interactions are showcased, none of these kids are a spit of their parents at all. "

Breaking that console sure cracked me up.\n\nHimawari is so incerdibly cute it's killing me !  \nSeeing Naruto and his family like that always pains me and I really hope to past the movie soon :/  \nThe Nara family is great ! What a funny family, love seeing Tamari kick ass :)\n\nOne thing that I keeps killing me is ~~Naruto~~ Boruto... and his Tenseigan !  \nI am dying for him to finaly talk to someone about it so we can have it as an actual topic.\n"

   "text": "The first 2 episodes were intriguing but now it's starting to feel like filler episodes of Shippuden. All this episode did was introduce Metal Lee, highly likely to just be a side character, in a really boring way. What else happened? Boruto saw that shadow, *again*. Boruto's upset at Naruto working a lot, *again*. Lol they even had 3-4 scenes of playing video games.\n\n\nBy the 4th episode of Naruto we had 4 central characters introduced - Naruto, Sasuke, Sakura, Kakashi. Their team was formed and already training. MC Rivalries formed and love interests set. Explanations of what the MC's ambitions are (aka what the story is going to be about). By the 6th episode they were already on their first team ninja mission. Not to mention all the explanations sprinkled throughout about the ninja world, chakra, etc., which Boruto skimmed over for obvious reasons.\n\n\nI really hope within the next couple episodes they [Go straight to Team Konohamaru stuff](/spoiler), but it doesn't seem like that will happen with this shadow thing going on. With how little they advanced the plot this episode and how much time dedicated to introducing Metal Lee, it seems like they'll probably spend the better portion of the next few episodes doing the same for characters like, [Sarada (next episode), Mitsuki, Himawari, other side characters](/spoiler).\n\n\nThis is pretty boring even as a viewer who watched all of Naruto and Shippuden and appreciates the character development"

Because (as it's the same director) I feel like this is more of a prequel to the movie if anything so it's setting things up with the idea you have seen that and no where a lot of these pieces go, which means it's more necessary to develop side characters as they didn't get that in the movie.

Naruto wanted recognition and so does Boruto and they both want to work for that. I think he gets his kind hearth from Hinata (Naruto always pushed for people to first prove that they would fight for themselves before stepping in.) \n\n Shikadai is much closer to his dad but after 3 episodes I do think he isn't AS much as a clone as I originally thought.

   "text": "Yea but I think it's sort of alright. We'll get to she's the creation of the teams for missions and the chuunin exam. The movie and manga has left out basically all of the school stuff. If you think about the Naruto series, the academy says are where we got to meet every character, see their story and specialties, and develop the friendships, rivalries, and love interests. It really set the stage for the rest of the series and I think it is somewhat valuable that we're getting it when the manga didn't have it. It's definitely filler but not as bad as the infinite dream shit lol. It actually serves a purpose for the most part."

How na\u00efve I was. :D Well, the original Naruto series was pretty good with fillers, but what I'm worried about is if it started so soon after the manga, it's gonna catch up pretty soon, and we'll likely have a year or two of fillers before getting to the good stuff."

   "text": "Well there isn't any currently other than Sarada/Boruto. However, I expect to see more as they develop the surrounding cast. I mean we are only 3 episodes in after all. I have to agree that we are probably about a year or so away from the chuunin exams. Then they'll probably use scenes animated from the movie and break that up into the TV format. Hopefully they'll fix the stuff left out in the movie that is in the Manga. They really will need to use a lot of filler because of the rate that the manga is being released, but so far it's not bad. I recommend reading the manga though!"

I'll keep what you said in mind though. Maybe I'll ask /r/Naruto. I used to grace that sub A LOT before the manga ended.\n\nThanks. I think I'll watch it but I need more suggestions. Maybe I wait a year before watching. I dunno."
