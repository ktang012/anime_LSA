Chtholly seems like she will be Chtholly for only matter of minutes left, and it looks like she will be the happiest girl in the world by knowing who she is and expressing whatever she has on her mind, and also understanding her own existence and that everything comes to an end. It's going to be tragic, but she's going to send them away with a smile, accepting everything. I don't see any possible way Willem will live through this again without breaking.

   "text": "I have been hearing good things about this show, so I just binge watched all 11 episodes over the course of roughly 12 hours. So what I'm about to say isn't just directed at this episode, but the season as a whole (and bear in mind that I don't know the source material whatsoever). \n\nI really like how cute all of the girls are, I like the sadness that we see in Willem, and that we have an MC who isn't a freaking teenager but actually a pretty collected and calm adult. But I feel like this show could have been amazing, and instead it's settling for just being a mashup of shonen and moe with an angsty twist. \n\nWe are finally learning some more of the backstory now, but it feels too uneven, and the whole premise of the gods needing to come to wipe out humanity feels forced and inexplicable. Are we supposed to believe that Elq is the \"good guy\" in this, and that next episode she will merge with Ctholly and save the day? Because that's what it is looking like now, and I don't really even expect Ctholly to die from it either, because she'll likely just come back yet again as herself. And I'm of two minds on this. On one hand, i want her to be happy, and Willem to be happy. But on the other... It's just *such poor storytelling.*\n\nThe show has failed to explain what humanity did that was so horrible, since it seemed like all of the human experimentation stuff was only a response to near omnipotent deities coming to destroy them. They haven't explained who the braves like Willem were, if they were a subset of humans or something more, they haven't explained where all the beast races came from. It's moe, it's cute, it has a lot of feels moments and hints at deeper emotional meanings, but ultimately it just keeps failing to live up to any of this potential. \n\nIs the source material better? Are these things more fleshed out and properly developed there? \n\nBecause right now I just keep thinking how much better this anime would be if Ctholly had died in that first battle, and the series turned into Willem's struggle to shoulder his demons and carry on caring for the girls, while trying to help them as penance for his past failures, even as that goal remains perpetually out of reach.

It's frustrating to get to know key points in the show via spoilers, many hints in the anime isn't enough to fill the expectations for the first viewers like me.\n\nBecause of that, I would rate this 5/6 out of 10, the couple are cute, characters are relatable, but the backstory needs to be developed to cater first viewers, or people will have your same judgment about the anime, and I concur with it"

Lilia and Willem's swordsmanship teacher, also the owner of the orphanage, plays a HUGE role and if I'm recalling correctly, he has been left out of the anime completely. Back in the past, the races were at odds with each other, and the humans were basically enemies of all of them. Willem is actually surprised to see a bunch of different races living together and living like the Emnetwyte used to. Back in his time, all of the races lived very differently - some in the trees, some in the mountains, some in huts, etc.  \n\nAt this point in the LN, it has been heavily hinted about who the 17 Beasts used to be and who turned them into it, but the motive hasn't been explained yet."

While I agree with you that the series does not tell the story properly, it tends to show more feel good moments with the characters in general.\n\nThe show itself is doing a good job adapting the ln, and while the way they have shown the backstory in this last episode was not ideal, it did a good job on telling what happened (on Elq's side) in the past. That is, IF we were going to have a second season. As you said, that felt forced and inexplicable, considering the fact that we have only one more episode to understand everything that happened, which I think it will go to an original ending and will leave some info loose.\n\nI would disagree with you when you say its superficial, though - while it tends to focus on cuteness of these little girls, it shows well the drama of Wilhem past experiences and how he is trying to cope with it anchoring his feelings on these new children of his.\n\nMaybe it's because you binged the series? Some shows are better digested in small samples and will get you more invested on it. That's what I feel.\n\nI recommend reading the LN - its halfway on the last book (4 + 1/2 out of 5) of the series and you can already read the part where they won't adapt in this season."
