While Merc has his issues, all of the bargaining chips lays with Zero. She has a ridiculous amount of power over Merc, which she never uses. She uses him to sleep on, for gods sake.

But manipulating people on the street speaks more to her personality, rather than her abilities. She can probably manipulate others at will, but does she want to? Evidence says no.\n\n>Coexistence is literally manipulating people to the point of tolerating things they wouldn't otherwise\n\nYou fucking what. Thats the dumbest fucking thing I've read all day.

Do you know why? Because Thirteen only **implied** she had used beastfallen heads. A lot of this series dialogue uses implication as a means to lie. Zero does it a lot, especially with Albus. She never outright lies though, except for to the guards about being sex slaves, which isn't a lie that hurts anyone. Also Beastfallen are historically used to hunt witches, which means the distrust is two sided. Your point is mute.\n\n>His power only requires a shred of doubt and she knows that it was magically manipulated, It's not brittle considering mercs actions previously\n\nIf he still harbors feelings of distrust after everything she has done to stand on equal footing with him (which they aren't. She just tries to level the playing field) then their relationship is brittle. Also, we do not know \"how much doubt\" is needed for his power. Once again, that is conjecture."

She doesn't understand that Youhei's been constantly mistreated, cheated, and betrayed all of his life, and that such experiences have negatively affected his ability to trust in or make connections with other people.\n\nThese two are in for a bumpy ride.
