Most anime have a lot, A FUCKING LOT OF DRAMA between   characters before they finally get together, here in GBF it flows so fucking natural, they just bond together, they're compatible and they're liking each other, is always there but at the same time is never a major plot point, it exist because is natural. FFS Gran almost confess himself in this episode.\n\nAlso rackam x katalina is my wishful thinking."

During that time more characters are obtainable and the drop rates for them are doubled.

Can't wait to see the journey to this next island. Also i'm still meh on Gran friend not going on this journey. I know the little dragon basically fills the role, but his friend was cute and the \"best friend on the journey giving backstory to the main character while serving barely any purpose\" could have gone to him :( lol"

You can basically call that outing a date and I just love how NATURAL their affection is for one another, not over dramatized nor overly spotlighted yet at the sametime not ignored/hidden either...just casually present with organic endearing moments like today and those are the type of romances i look for in entertainment \ud83d\ude0a\n\nThough P.S.
