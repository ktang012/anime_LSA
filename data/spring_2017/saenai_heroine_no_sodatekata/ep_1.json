[Spoiler](/s \"They even almost kiss..through skype...Not to mention the constant hand holding...slowly walking together to stall time and be together etc\") \n\nThe reason she didnt just hug him was because it wasn't the right thing to do. Right now in this moment she isn't her girlfriend and hugging him wont bring Eriri and Utaha back. Letting Tomoya just cry it out was a better thing to do as he was bottling up all these feelings. It was better for him to accept reality that they are leaving than hug him in her arms and say nice things such as its \"going to be okay\" or \"they are gonna come back to us.\"\n\nThis may seem cruel in Katou's part and she had a hard time forcing herself to not hug him. But in the long run allowing Tomoya to go back on his feet and move on with the game was less cruel than giving him false hopes and breaking it."

They both aimed for the 2nd most valuable relic, the kiss. Our spy forces have confirmed that Utaha was the one to claim it.\n\n  However the goddess Megumi did not rest. The conquering plans of land Tomoya began with operation \"Date\". The relic was taken ragardless, but we believe that we have enough political influence upon these lands and we are ready to strike at any moment.\n\nAll my beloved brothers and sisters who have gathered here in this humble thread, pray for the Third Season! Let your mind be heard! No matter if our prayers are heard or not, I shall begin my journey to the LN temple. It has been told they know of the future and I can not wait any longer to see our Megumi Katou reign as she had deserved! "

Kato shippers are trying to spin that as two things happening: first, she was trying to \"save\" Eriri from doing it and not being able to interact with Tomoya at school because of it (though that's a fair interpretation since she sorta claims that's why she did it); and second, she was throwing in the towel. The kiss was her declaration that she's done pursuing Tomoya because she knows she's beat, and they'll be apart anyways since she'll be at college. Yes, Kato shippers are *genuinely* trying to spin that as Utaha giving up, despite the fact that she explicitly tells him \"I'm giving up on giving up\". If anything, this was Utaha's declaration of war. But Kato shippers say \"Ahhh, that's it, she has closure now, she can move on.\" It's this weird sense of denial, like they can't admit that Kato even has competition for Tomoya, so they're constantly desperately reassuring themselves that all other challengers have been vanquished.

But the thing about them is, they *also* feel the need to constantly tell other people that their ship has sunk. I can't tell you how many comments I've seen that are the exact same thing: \"Welp, best girl Kato didn't get much/any screentime, but this was still a great send-off episode for Utaha x Tomoya... that being said, the ship has sailed. It's sunk. It's done. Hopefully now, Utaha shippers will shut up about her and focus on true best girl, Kato. Kato best girl btw.\"\n\n>It's all got this ring of like... desperation to it. Like they know in their hearts that they're wrong.\n\nRemember how this all started out with me saying that Kato shippers wouldn't shut up about how other girls suck? Remember how I never made the argument that Kato is bad? Remember how you completely missed my point? and then went on to prove my point over and over again about what gigantic gaping assholes Kato fans are? I remember :)"

   "text": "Okay so that's the end of Saekano SS2. SS1 didn't leave me much impression. But this time, I'm going to miss it dearly.\n\nBefore going to season 2, I binged season 1 of Saekano, and while the humor, the fan service, the best girl war is there, the plot isn't that on point so I probably wasn't expecting SS2 much. When SS2 airs, I watched the first 4 episodes before went on a break because of my university study, I thought: \"Well, the beginning was.... okay, I guess\". And this time, I got an Amazon Prime subscription and started binging til now, and BOY WAS I IN FOR A THRILLING RIDE. From episode 4 to 10, the plot changes to somthing unbelievably good for a harem anime, the drama, although not as serious as Maruto's another work White Album 2, is real. It deals with the relationship between the members of Blessing Software into the future as soon as Winter Comiket is over (with how torn it is choosing to pursue professional career or stay with Tomoya's doujin team from both Utaha and Eriri, or how Tomoya choose Eriri over his team's deadline, making Megumi(!) completely angry at him). Moreso, character development is lit, not only the girls but MC-kun himself too, the more drama they're into, the closer their distance shrinks, in which finally they called each other in one's first name (a huge thing in Japan, showing they are very close friend) - even Utaha calls him \"Unethical\", and on the subject of Utaha, [that steal tho](http://i.imgur.com/XHC5VEY.png), and [poor Eriri's reaction](http://i.imgur.com/4UuEPY5.png) makes me laugh.\n\nAnd what I want to point out the most, is Kato Megumi. The name of the series is \"How To Raise A Boring Girlfriend\", and toward the finale this title makes so much sense. From a girl with probably zero reactions at the beginning of the series in season 1 who always savagely and tactlessly burn Tomoyo (lol), she turns herself into a complete different person in season 2, each episode she became cuter and cuter, wearing more cute clothes and have her hairstyle changes twice from ponytail to long, straight hair. Her emotion is probably her biggest change, especially when Tomoya hid the fact that he missed the deadline to her, she became very angry at him, this shows how deep her passionate to Blessing Software was. And even when Tomoya apologised to her she still think that it was cheap, and went all tsuntsun and deredere in her own episode 8 lol. And in this episode, she deliberately return to her appearance when her and Tomoya first met, which is to say that she will continue to be Tomoya's main heroine in his next game with the same name as this series's title, but ironically she didn't realise that she herself had became probably the best girlfriend one can ever find (and yes, imo Kato Megumi win this best girl war - come at me now Utaha and Eriri's fanboy).\n\nIn the after credit, Izumi joins Tomoya and Megumi's school, as per Iori's suggestion. And it looks like his doujin team can continue even without Utaha and Eriri who decided to work for Akane. But still, [it looks like they can't get over with him having a new girl joins his harem](http://imgur.com/BQtyYLa).\n\nBut of course, like SS1, SS2 keeps the tradition of [breaking](http://imgur.com/7rbynXC) [the](http://imgur.com/JT016jn) [fourth wall](http://imgur.com/sBCvxnc). And I sincerely hope Michiru's verse means a final adaptation (season 3) to complete this series in anime since the source material ended at volume 12 I think? \n\nOverall, it was a very good experience. And if someone ask me whether should they watch this, it's definitely a yes (if they can keep the fan service at bay lul)\n\nSS1 of Saekano I gives a 7.5/10. But SS2 of Saekano I'll give it an 8.5\n\nAnd this episode alone I give it a 10/10, while episode 8 deserves a 9.5/10\n\nBy the way, anyone knows if Saekano has official LN translation or fan translation? I'm dying to know what happens next"

In these types of shows, first girl that gets introduced almost always wins (Nisekoi, Oreigairu).\n\nWhat made this season way better than the first one was the character development, especially between the two stars of this season, Megumi and Eriri. \n\nMegumi breaks away from her deadpan brick wall in episode 8, portraying a character pretty different from how she usually is. She seems to have gotten closer to Tomoya, basically hovering between good friend and love interest. She seems a lot more developed in this season.\n\nEriri personally has been my favorite. While Megumi can be seen as having almost no flaws, Eriri is the complete opposite with a whole bundle of flaws. However, through the season, it seems like she matured a bit. She blames herself and apologizes for how she treated Tomoya. She has the courage to give up a love interest in order to further dedicate to her love for drawing, and she puts more guilt on herself for betraying Tomoya the second time, rather than purely blaming Tomoya for his incompetence. While she still has a lot of flaws, such as having unrealistic expectations or being a coward, her charachter progression has really been the highlight for me. "

It was after 3 volumes that they finally had a heart to heart and reconciled.  Since the rivalry and friendship between Katou and Eriri is quite central to the second half of the LN, this is going to be an obstacle for S3 adaptation, but I hope the author can still manage it somehow.  Katou having a phone call with Eriri is anime original, I think the author is leaving it open ended so that Katou didn't personally showing up can be implying that the girls still need a bonding time to smooth things over.

Tomoya deals with Akane that he will be handling both Eriri and Utaha to finish the game. As some character said - Akane may have given Eriri and Utaha the challenge to push their limits and reach greater heights but Tomoya has the capability to make them really work together and work harder. Though this is good news, Tomoya didn't consult Megumi regarding his decision. Thus, making a repeat of Tomoya and Megumi quarrel.

   "text": "So it ended. :]\n\nKatou being best girl of this anime like always. What Utaha did was a little dirty (poor Eriri), but hey that's kinda her character and still can't compare to Katou. Katou managed to finish this season amazingly and though she lost that piece of shit Best Girl contest she's won this anime and my hearts.\n\nI really feel that this season is miles better than the first season. First season really feels like a generic harem with all the cliches and tropes they had that just manages to be above others by being meta and self-referential. Seriously, it had the titular character feel like a regular harem side character (why even are the final episodes focused on Eriri). Season 2 came though and it was brilliant. I disliked Utaha and Eriri before but I liked them fine now too.\n\nBut overall Katou's development throughout the series was what made this anime truly a great one. It was fun watching her being deadpan and savage all the time before but she's ascended to one of my best girls this time. Seeing her laugh and cry, and being a great friend, waifu material, and main heroine. That was really great.\n\nAlso wtf Michiru appears NOW. And that red-haired girl. They felt like unnecessary additions to Season 1, just inserted there to complete the cliched characters for the harem. Putting them in the back burner this season seems like a great idea; this season managed to be amazing without them appearing much. The ending scene kinda hints though that they might be more focused on Season 3 IF we ever have one. (Please have one)"

   "text": "For those wondering, this ending seemed to indicate no S3, but it might just be a \"just in case\" way to wrap up. A lot of changes to the source material, but some of it was refreshing, I thought. Overall, this series has been relatively positive regarding its deviation from the novel, while otherwise being pretty faithful. Here are some comparisons based on how the LN goes.\n\n[LN changes](/s \"The Eriri part of the ending was probably the starkest alteration. In the novel, Megumi remained angry for several volumes and stopped speaking to Eriri. The short flashback where Megumi confronts Eriri is a long dialogue in the novel, where Eriri tries to explain herself but Megumi berates her for leaving her, forcing Utaha to break the news, and ultimately hurting Tomoya. Eriri hits back saying that Megumi left Tomoya as well, but Megumi vows to never leave him and the circle again.\")\n\n[More changes](/s \"The date part of Megumi's return never happened in the novel, but the result was essentially the same. Megumi waits for Tomoya on the hill and acts as heroine-like as in this episode. She then apologizes for not being there for Tomoya and, likewise, motivates him to continue the circle. Tomoya, in his internal monologue, promises to never leave Megumi out again and to keep going onward with 'the best partner.' Most of what's in the anime dialogue makes it\")\n\n[MORE changes](/s \"A few more, smaller alterations: Utaha and Michiru don't show up at school in the end but Michiru fails the entrance exam to transfer to it. Much of the Megumi date scene appeared influenced by the volume immediately following the one this episode adapts, including the hand holding part. However, a vast majority of it is completely original. Also, Tomoya and Megumi reaching first name basis was briefly squeezed into this episode, but doesn't happen until the next volume.\")\n\nI think A-1 did a great job overall with this season. While I wish this part of the story was a little closer to source, if A-1 intends to end the series here completely it's shaped up to be an excellent conclusion. There are still 8 volumes after this episode's events, so definitely check out the summaries on r/Saekano !"

I was excited and happy Aki was getting ready to start working on the second game after the success of the first one. Once we learned Utaha and Eriri were not going to be part of the project I got upset and annoyed by their decision. They did a really good job of projecting the sadness Aki felt and painting them as traitors for deciding to work with Akane. I understand it was a once in a lifetime opportunity to bring their creative potential past their limits. Had Aki been able to get Eriri out of her slump then it would have been a completely different story. The kiss at the train station was completely unexpected but I'm glad it happened. \n\nThis is the second romcom out of 3 I've watched so far I'm genuinely invested in continuing; I mainly delve into series like Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, Boku no Hiro Academia, and One Piece. But I think this will be my last one too, it's just frustrating how things don't always pan out for the characters you like. "

There's no one else besides her.\n\nUtaha stole that kiss from Eriri and she knew it. She's basically unethical for Mr. Ethical now. The race for Tomoya is still on.\n\nThat date was something, man. Megumi is such a touching and cool person to hang around with for Tomoya. She definitely wanted to hug him when he broke down in front of her.\n\nMichiru fucking showing up at the very end just nab a little bit of screen time. She was nowhere to be seen in the second season and now she shows up at the end... The 4th wall breaking in this show is something else.\n\nAnd this concludes season 2 of Saekano. I'm hopeful for a third season but the way this episode ended makes me think that there would be no futher anime adaptations in the future. I mean, the guys put in a \"The End\" card and all of that. However, Tomoya's drive to make his new game and the hints from the other characters about the future tells me otherwise. Whatever happens next, I'll be ready to watch/read it."
