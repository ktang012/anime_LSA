Even though I hate Satori as a character (I can't stand those characters that speak in a slow and cocky way) I really enjoyed the episode.\n\nBut the last conversation between Nomura and Satori was kinda odd. She got mad cause she lost so she threatened him with throwing the memory into the water, he got mad an bitchslaped her (best scene) and then she got even madder and started to trashtalking but it was all ok after Nomura said that was mad because she made Oginawara cry, that was a really weird IMO."
