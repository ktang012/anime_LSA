Like the animators decided to not completely erase their non-final marks from sketches before animating. Was this a conscious decision from the art dept. or...something else because the backgrounds look awesome. It's a bit interesting, usually if an anime is deemed not to be enjoyable, people will complain about it and it'll be one of the top comments. Here, it seems like the score just drops and people just leave. "

An anime's audience doesn't want see fetch quests taking place, they only work in games because the player has control over them.  I'm going to give this show one more chance next week to improve.
