Carry on.\" or something to that effect.\n\nIt really does give that feel. A bit more excitement in the sense that we're dealing with potentially life-threatening events here rather than the typical economic situations of Spice and Wolf, but still the dynamic between Zero and Mercenary really does bring Holo and Lawrence to mind."

Just caught up with this show yesterday and I'm liking it pretty much so far. Has a bit of action, I like the characters, humor is pretty good.\n\nMC is actually a decent and reasonable guy [Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/tbJJAAM.png),  [Pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/DqiQ6tj.png) (plus that running away scene from episode 1). He's not overreacting to everything and is very grounded. I like that very much.\n\nZero is so adorable in her actions and obliviousness to the world, I can barely handle it.\n\n[Nom](http://i.imgur.com/SAIgZHj.gifv)! Oh that's [tasty](http://i.imgur.com/ieZnQbG.png)! [Let me go](http://i.imgur.com/RiCAkAE.gifv)!  [Peekaboo](http://i.imgur.com/ohH7q3t.png)!  [The Search](http://i.imgur.com/MoB0kb8.png)!  [The pout](http://i.imgur.com/psM7GZw.png)\n\nThe group's chemistry is pretty damn fun [Albus bullied](http://i.imgur.com/up8YBAa.png),  [Purchase for Albus](http://i.imgur.com/l8bjKaG.png), especially the relationship between Mercenary And Zero [Zero's a simple person] (http://i.imgur.com/q7eOk5P.png), [carry](http://imgur.com/LswYRpT),  [whack](http://i.imgur.com/b869nBb.png),  [Hanging out](http://i.imgur.com/Ep3GRc8.png)\n\nI-------------------------------------------------I\n\n**More on the episode itself**:\n\nGetting into town was hilarious[merc face], thanks to Zero's [quick wit](http://i.imgur.com/EIr5eG1.png) and I'm surprised how Albus just [played along](http://i.imgur.com/CrS8EkU.png).\n\nZero carries  quite a bit of valuable gems with her is quite careless with them because being clueless about how the world [functions](http://i.imgur.com/aK9ln9z.png), very me_irl quote. Good thing she's got our favorite Mercenary by her side. Mercenary [tries to be tough](http://i.imgur.com/D4FNvDJ.png) but Albus knows [how it really is](http://i.imgur.com/iKT8KPI.png)\n\nThey've gone shopping and even that cant go without a ton of [hilarious](http://i.imgur.com/Uw6D5qQ.gifv) and [great](http://i.imgur.com/Hvk2zJN.png) scenes [( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)](http://i.imgur.com/ibb5l85.png) - Merchant reacts accodringly. Looks like Albus is more [fashion savy](http://i.imgur.com/zPlXctZ.png) than Zero. Why am I not surprised? \n\n[Not that I l-like your new aoutfit or a-anything](http://i.imgur.com/tUEaEfZ.png)!  [Baka](http://i.imgur.com/P4VF3rO.png)!\n\nOh, well, that's... [unfortunate](http://i.imgur.com/opcIZm2.png). And it finally gives us more of a prespective why are Beastfallen so disliked by the society. Freaking out at random is not a great thing.\n\nHe can still be a [white knight](http://i.imgur.com/59T8TLm.png), right? His fur is white enough.\n\nA place that takes Beastfallen but costs a fortune? I guess it's sleeping on the stree... [nope, no problem here](http://i.imgur.com/VQPgqfI.png), or was it maybe [good looks](http://i.imgur.com/vsdtK7t.png)?\n\n[Drunk](http://i.imgur.com/Ep3GRc8.png) Zero's [hilarious](http://i.imgur.com/Rrjf224.png)\n\nThe new [character](http://i.imgur.com/K0HdrZk.png), introduced in this episode is hitting all the correct [bad guy vibes](http://i.imgur.com/2EUGive.png). And he's pretty sensitive about his identity as a [~~Dog-face~~ wolf](http://i.imgur.com/71waCmI.png)\n\nZero's pretty confident in Merceneary's skills [Pic 1](http://i.imgur.com/NHZ2FDJg.png),  [Pic 2](http://i.imgur.com/MoB0kb8.png). Serious [confidence](http://i.imgur.com/kGnu6FQ.png).  And it seems for a good rason too, he's pretty skilled, while Dog-face's all about being flashy. Zero's punishment for Dog-face was pretty hilarious. Cheeky little thing.\n\nMercenary's shown to be a very moral and logical person once again with releasing those three. I guess we'll be seeing way more of Dog-face, since he's in the OP. He'll probably be quite pissed and hopefully we find out his real name.\n\n\n[Staying in the other room](http://i.imgur.com/ZdaExVu.png)? Yeah, [no way](http://i.imgur.com/crWNk2Zg.png) she's missing out on [the soft fur bed](http://i.imgur.com/LTnHYs7.png)\n\nI-------------------------------------------------I\n\n**Final thoughts**:\n\nTo sum up, it was a fun episode and it seems that exposition time is done and it's time for the plot to get rolling. Mercenary has a knack for getting himself into strange situations and I'm not sure if he understands completely what's he gotten himself into yet (to be honest, neither do we, the watchers).\n\nI'm looking forward where this show will be going in the episodes to come."

In a world where the vast majority of them are over-dramatic grande action stories, Grimoire of Zero stands out as the true Fantasy world Anime for me. Instead of focusing on stretched action scenes and big villains it takes a laid-back attitude to explore its world and the culture surrounding it in a fantastic way. Zero and Merc both feel charming and unique and the series avoids a lot of overused tropes that others of the genre fall into. It's a really nice compromise between classic Fantasy stories and a Spice and Wolf-like atmosphere, that makes for a great watch even for people not into action of fantasy. Good stuff."

I get the impression she's been in the cave for at least 10 years, which means she shouldn't have any social graces at all (sure she's still quirky, but she more or less can get by in society). A 16 year old living in a cave for that long probably wouldn't be half as well adjusted to other people. Also, like some other users pointed out in the episode 1 and 2 threads, she likes to use older types of language.\n\nEdit: To clarify, I'm saying she strikes me as someone who acts weird because she doesn't care, not because she isn't aware of social cues."
