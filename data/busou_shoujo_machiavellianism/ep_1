I really grew to like all the characters: especially Nomura, Inaba and Amou, though others are great as well. They are all bright and each has a unique personality and traits, alongside with their combat style. I would normally give a 8/10 for this one, but I had to give it 9/10, because of the really satisfying ending.  \n\nThough the chances are low, I wouldn't mind a 2nd season.

I loved how he didn't take shit from these girls and if they were ready to throw down he wouldn't back down, and kick their asses. Usually the MC in harem anime are someone I would never want to be, but I thought Nomura was a great MC. For the most part the five main females where very enjoyable and grew on me. Amou is something special, she's a fierce Woman. The show definitely has its problems and like all anime won't be for everyone but I think it did things more enjoyable then the typical harem show and in some cases approached certain moments differently.\n\n7/10 (Okay)\n\nEdit: Amou came very close to stealing my heart but Rin Onigawara, in the end, kept it.

From Wikipedia:\n\n>A new model of Machiavellianism based in organizational settings consists of three factors: maintaining power, harsh management tactics, manipulative behaviors.\n\nIt was a work mainly used by state leaders who realized that revolutions were starting to become a thing, so they needed ways to keep the people either content or scared enough in order to keep their power.\n\nThe girls in the show use many tactics like that, from torture, misinformation (the fake sex photo), ally betrayal (the fat dude), seduction, blackmail, bureaucracy, threats of violence and finally, straight out violence, all to control and maintain their power over others. Nomura on the other hand never employs such statics, always refusing both to coerce others and be coerced, only going violent in self defense. He kinda represents anarchism and freedom, always wanting to understand other's perspective and create bonds of trust (his motivation). So yeah, nakama power ftw.\n\nAgreed, the worst part of the show was the \"Mc-kun is mine\" bits. The 2 main girls literally never talk about anything else.\n\n"
