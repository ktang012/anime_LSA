She knows Akane is sensitive and has problems with anxiety and even specifically sees how much it can mess Akane up during a race when Akane lost her squeeze toy before the sports festival race. She specifically knew how much Akane needed that squeeze toy for her anxiety before a race. So then when the big track meet is coming up she text akane saying she has a crush on Azumi even though knowing he is Akanes bf. Then just before Akane is about to run at the meet she makes a point to bring back up the text making sure Akane saw it and  that it is in the forefront of Akane's mind instead of her focusing on the race like she should been. She knew perfectly well what that would do to Akane with her anxiety and personality. Almost every person who plays a competitive sport that isn't a idiot knows better than to bring stuff like that up just before the person is about to compete distracting them. Especially when it is a individual person event. Even if try say maybe she really didn't know that makes her just as bad that she didn't know what it would do to Akane considering she is suppose be Akanes best friend and what she already knows about Akane. Even Azumi who has nothing to do with sports and not known Akane for long knew better than let Akane know he was there during the race when she didn't want him there."

   "text": "So I caught up to the series and I have say I can't stand his mom and her so called best friend is a piece of shit. I mean not only is she trying steal her bf but she also purposely sabotaged her at that earlier track meet. Seriously you are going tell your shy, sensitive  friend with the known anxiety issues that you have a crush on her bf just before the track meet and then just before she runs you going reiterate it to make sure she not only got the message but also it is foremost on her mind when she should be focusing on the run. It was already shown that she is jealous  that Akane is faster than her and there is no way she didn't know that would affect her during the race. She knows about Akane anxiety and has even seen it mess her up during a race in the sports fest when she lost her squeeze toy that she knew was so important to Akane. If try say maybe she  really didn't know that it would effect her then that makes her just as bad. Not knowing your\"best friend\" would have a reaction like the with what she already knows is just bs. "

A lot of Asian parents are like that in fact, especially in middle class families from which I belonged to.

But now that I've grown up and have a family of my own, I understand she only wanted what was best for me without an ounce of selfishness.

And while she doesn't necessarily approve of that he spends so much time writing, she has never actually stopped him from doing it. (Granted, she did say she would force him to stop these things if his grades suffered too much, but that's reasonable enough.)\n\nI agree that she could be more supportive, but she's just a concerned mom.

Like him telling her not at the dinner table and telling Azumi it is ok for him to do what makes him happy instead of obsessing over which school to get into. Also Azumi isn't actually a push over and would probably full on rebel if she tried going to far and I think she knows this. People in part are reacting to her what might seem unreasonably because they can recognize how much worst she would be if she could get away with it. IF she could fully have her way she would force him to stay home and study 24/7 and have no life. As far as clubs go well they tend to be looked favorably on when trying get into a school. So him being in one looks good to her. She doesn't even know he has a gf. Imagine how much she would flip if she did."

Maybe even the best one on a writing level.\n\nLooking at the show, their relationship hasn't been anything fated or monumental. But it *has* provided each of them with new experiences and feelings and drive that they have never had before. Both on a romantic and personal level. Using a cliche, \"it's better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.\"\n\nPlus, they're still in middle school. How many couples from that time in life manage to stay together? \"High-school sweethearts\" is a thing, but I don't recall there being \"middle-school sweethearts.\" In this way, their separation would be a realistic outcome -- something the anime has championed for the entire season.\n\nAs I said, I'm still personally rooting for them to stay together all the way through. But the critic in me wants to see their relationship end with bittersweet feelings to hone its thematic edge that much more."

Finding another guy that can do that for her would not be easy. He is a interesting mix of  laidback and calm while also being able take charge and take action when need while generally knowing the right things to do naturally when dealing with her. So far the other bf types we seen have been the scumbag who just using the girl for his own satisfaction. The lackey who is just used by his \"gf\" and is her whipping dog. Then we have the pushy domineering  one who basically ordered the girl to be his gf. While a lot of guys will fall into these personality types to some degree they would all have a negative effect on Akane. Then we have Azumi who is just right that doesn't smother her while at the same time doesn't stay to distant or uninvolved and has a calming effect on her that will just grow over time and let her be herself. He could obviously find other gfs without a big deal and while she could find other bfs it be rather hard to find ones that can give her what she needs like he seems to be able to so far. He seems to be just a tad more mature than most the other guys we've seen."

   "text": "\"Faito!\" The anime.  \n\nSo we start off with our usual adorable couple moments (*she came to visit him at the bookstore, oh my God aaahhhhhhhh*) and then immediately try to ruin it. We have Chinatsu not knowing when to give up, some indecision on choosing schools, and worst of all Akane's family might be moving away nooooooooo.  \nSo it looks like the Kawagoe festival is probably going to be the finale of the show, where everything gets resolved. We're either going to get a happy \"Koutarou and Akane go to the same school and live happily ever after together\" ending, or a bittersweet \"They move apart from each other, but that's okay because life goes on and they've still got most of their life ahead of them\" ending. Either way I'll probably end up in tears."
