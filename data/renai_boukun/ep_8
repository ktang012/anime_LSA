Like, there's heavy implications in the manga Haku was lying to Naruto, especially since at the time they were enemies and Haku's whole nindo is about deceiving people, and then on top of that Haku was implied to have attraction towards Zabuza, and Japan wasn't exactly.. *tolerant* of homosexuality back when Naruto started if I recall correctly(though I may be mixing that up with them being Xenophobic as fuck).\n\nThere's still debate even now on whether Haku is a guy or girl."
