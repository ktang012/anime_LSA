   "text": "I can't really think of any specifically that has done it *bad*, but just *uninteresting*. Here's one. The old Fairy Tail looked like just a bunch of tribal tattoos in a circle and didn't really have much animation detail. They had 2, 3 elements at most and just scaled up from the center and probably glowed and some particles would appear. And this is the one the most iconic magic world series. I guess it didn't have to follow any sort of rules since it is a wholly fictional anime universe so there's nothing stopping anyone. It was just boring magic circles. Maybe it's why the 2014 season seemed to have moved on from circles entirely (I haven't watched much) Just my perspective. EDIT 2: Went back and looked at some Fairy Tail magic circles. They're pretty cool I guess\n\nAkashic Records has much more detail and is just more visually engaging, I mean it's frickin' *magic*. It's easy to miss all the meaningful detail that goes into these. They're not on screen for too long. Each spell has relevant symbols in the outer edge design e.g. Sisti's [wind magic](http://i.imgur.com/6hO4A9s.jpg) has leaf things, [Shock Bolt](http://i.imgur.com/aYxmALc.jpg) has lightning, [healing magic](http://i.imgur.com/ODlEJ4d.jpg) has crosses, [Dispel Force](http://i.imgur.com/WHjMNuk.jpg), though an octagon, not unlike a stop sign, gives the feeling of defensive magic.[ The large, layered barrier that was holding Rumia in episode 3](http://i.imgur.com/TfgxDrV.jpg) was surrounded by shapes that resembled padlocks, or something gate/castle-like, giving the impression of being a strong, barrier or holding spell. (EDIT: The bad guy said it's a teleportation spell but it's combined with Sacrifice, meant to activate the spell. Makes sense that something powerful like a Sacrifice would require something powerful to lift it. idk) This idea is further reinforced when Glenn used his blood as a catalyst. And the rest of the elements have a resemblance to actual arcane symbols and design. No weird tribal tattoos. And they have at least a good handful of elements- [Extinction Ray](http://i.imgur.com/OZLKRWw.jpg) has 8 I think. It *looked* like powerful spiky make-things-dead magic. There's one I thought that was *okay*: Rumia's [standard magic circle](http://i.imgur.com/ArUgc0j.jpg) on the floor of episode 2. Compared to the others it's not fancy but Glenn mentioned that it's an easy magic so I guess it was supposed to be simple to do. At least it makes sense as a double pentagram and not tribal tattoos\n\nSo far Akashic has the most stunning magic circles, that also make sense intuitively, and have the most detail that I've seen so far. I haven't seen *that many* magic series and not all of them use magic circles. Just my perspective.\n\nEDIT: Added pictures ([album](http://imgur.com/a/mWriS))\n\nEDIT2: I made this a full post: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6ab0gb/magic_circles_in_anime_minor_akashic_records/?ref=share&ref_source=link"

But I guess they had to cut it short to finish up the arc in this episode.\n\nRumia already needed Glenn 2 times to rescue her in 2 arcs without doing much. I know she is not a fighter type like Sisti and more of a supporter, but give her at least some spotlight. I hope Glenn trains her in the future so she can defend herself, because she seems to be really important for the bad guys and they will probably come after her in the future.\n\nStill good episode. More Rumia is always good and she got her closure with the queen, which was nice."

I'm not good at symbolismmeaningMother'sBasement-style analysis, but I firmly believe that a good OP needs to be a lot like a good AMV, and this OP does fantastically at that.\n\nI mean, like, you'd think that would be basic OP 101, but a lot of shows just kind of give a nod toward timing instead of actively making it a major point in their OPs, even though having good timing doesn't get in the way of good anything else. I'm not saying other shows' OPs *don't* have timing or even that they don't have *good* timing, but the timing comes secondary to everything else, so if they'd rather get in a clip of whatever, they'll go ahead and ignore timing in favor of that. \n\nNot that that's the only thing that makes an OP good of course. Little Witch Academia's OPs have been of the secondary timing sort, but they've definitely been good. But I really really appreciate an OP like Rokudenashi (or Dimension W)'s because it is less common and it's fun to watch.\n\nThat aside, I'm pretty disappointed they didn't explain the match with the conditional magic, since the reasoning was pretty interesting in the LN I thought. \n\nI like that his former comrades are able to encompass a very Glenn-type feeling... and that his students are more motivated by not wanting to experience patronizing Glenn more than anything else. \n\nOh fuck! It was a Glenn-type feeling because it fucking *was* Glenn! And no wonder Sistine was like \"oh!\"\n\nAh, so Glenn *did* remember her. I wish he looked younger in those flashbacks. He still looks the same age as now, but he was like, what, 16? There should be some sort of passage of time visible T_T But I guess it's easier for the animators not to worry about that maybe. "

But what ticks me off the most is how the guards, who are supposed to be the cream of the crop in the entire kingdom, were so easily and deeply infiltrated. And about that maid, you'd think they'd thoroughly investigate someone before hiring them as the queen's personal servant, but that'd be too inconvenient for the plot, I guess."
