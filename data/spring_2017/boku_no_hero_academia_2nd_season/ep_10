Probably because [it's essentially a freaking Stand!](http://i.imgur.com/5RtfoLE.png)\n\nThis section of the arc brings back one of my favorite things in battle shounen. Unorthodox teams, where the mangaka decides to mix it up and stray away from the norm. Mina with Bakugou, Tsuyu with Mineta (willingly!), Deku with Tokoyami. It's so badass and fun to watch. I love it. \n\n[Wish they could have kept this from the scanlation,](http://i.imgur.com/Oo591Oq.png) but it's perfectly reasonable why they couldn't.\n\n"

We've seen his quirk before and it's pretty badass, I wonder why no one recruited him first. Also Mei is really shaping up to be a great character. I hope we see her collaborate more with Deku in the future. Maybe develop his new suit? Or a limiter of some sort for his quirk? Thinking of all the possibilities is just making me so excited!"

Midoriya's team composition was a clever one, but it seems to be lacking in offensive power, which I'm confident will come back to bite them. It was cool to see the heroes finding people they can work with and tactically build their teams. Tact is a thing a lot of Battle series seem to lack, but BnhA is overflowing with it. I'll definitely be rooting for Mineta's team to take it. Not only do I love Tsuyu, I also think they have the best team composition, and it'd be nice to see them rise up as the underdogs. Mineta deserves some glory. Let's see next week I suppose!\n\nAlso, a nice detail was how the male teammates of Invis girl were constantly blushing, because in order to be invisible she has to be naked. That was a nice touch.

Your own definition fits perfectly with it. \n\n> It's like saying a mobile phone is a complementing item if you can't do telepathy.\n\nFalse equivalency.

Support people make equipment designed to help people's specific situations. A jetpack can fall into that easily. How *desperate* can you get?\n\n> Dont call people liers when you have no proof.
