To the point where guns are a thing? what does the *the age of the shinobi is over?* translate to. Take it literally and imply that technology has advanced to the point where killing even powerful shinobi is very easy? or take it as metaphor? \n\nMy point is the ease level for killing naruto or sasuke will eventually boil down to how advanced technology is. And at that, how advanced is the secret technology of the ultra wealthy? (If the LN tales with the wealthy being seemingly otherworldly in appearance is true)\n\nThis is why i personally do not like the turn baruto took at all. The world they are in now, its almost unbelievable Ninja are not completely obsolete yet. Although this is probably what the Sneak peak into the future implied. Technology evolved to the point where ninja are completely obsolete, even the most powerful are sharing the fate of the weaker ones. Baruto simply stepped outside of the believable world for me. And it just doesn't feel natural/believable anymore, this is what i liked about the original naruto was that the world they lived in with the technological advancements they had at the time allowed the concept of Ninja to be there without ninja being incredibly easy to kill because \"lul technology\" Same with the strange tattoos.

The worlds just feel so immensely different its hard to compare the two and think \"is this the same universe? with the same idea for a plot?\"  \n\nAlso the changes to stardust crusaiders were because Hamon had basically reached its creative/power maximum. You can't improve or change hamon too much. Stands could get much more creative, and even as technology evolved in the universe it infused it in certain aspects instead of trying to hide it or make you believe that it was a hidden threat. \n\nMany stands incorporated modern (or at the age of writing SC) technology.

I think he's really well balanced as a character, although if he didn't have the dynamic that he does with his family he'd come across a bit differently I think.\n\n> I also really liked how fast paced the episode was with something always happening and nothing seemed drawn out or unnecessary. I didn't have time to look away.\n\nYeah a lot of that comes down to this director, he's responsible for all the best moments in  the later stages of Shippuden and has been brought on for this series (and the film, which is available to watch if you wanted to see a bit further in the Boruto time line).\n\n> Probably going to keep watching it.

Boruto is shown tapping into a version of this power in the episode.\n\nGlad you seemingly enjoyed it, hopefully that continues. "

These abilities are available to anyone who trains to use them, with different ones being harder to learn than others. The shadow clone technique was the move Naruto used most often so it makes sense it would be something Boruto would pick up early.\n\n**Genjutsu** This is mind tricks, kind of like psychic techniques, I think the snake thing may come under a form of genjutsu.\n\n**Taijustsu** This is your standard hand to hand combat, there is a specific character in the original series who was completely unable to learn to nin or gen jutsu so relied solely on Tai jutsu. [This is the best example of him](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNTspQ5uUUU)\n\n---\n\nNow there are abilities which are hereditary, these are called **Kekkai Genken**, so things like the Hinatas eyes fall under this. You'll see a lot of these abilities coming up as most of the class are an offspring of a Kekkai Genken.\n\n> Oh and one last thing I found weird.. Naruto has a weirdly high childlike voice.\n\nIn a bit to keep his voice similar to how we was when he was first shown as a 12 year old, he's been voiced by a voice actress, it's a new girl for the Boruto universe but it still shows that it's not a guy voicing him."

Naruto has the most powerful demons in the world sealed inside of his body. He can freely use their powers whenever he pleases. On top of this, there is a ninja known as the Sage of Six Paths. This dude is the original ninja and actually founded the basis for all future ninja. He lived a loooong time ago, like around the beginning of humanity time. This man is essentially a god. Naruto meets the soul of this man in the previous series and the sage gives Naruto half of his power. The combination of the demons' power and the sage power turn Naruto into the strongest character in the series. He's pretty much a god of destruction."

Except I'm not a fan of that scene to begin with. To me there is no chance that isn't just a cheap way to hook the viewer, and it's going to be a long time before anything with that gets resolved which makes it feel even worse.\n* The animation is really good! Nice.\n* I'm not sure what it is but the opening doesn't even feel like the opening of a shonen to me. I've read somewhere that the series is going to start as a more laid back slice-of-life esque affair before it unravels into the greater scope of the series. The opening, then, did its job if that's what it was supposed to communicate - Nevermind the small bit all the other kids, it felt more like a K-On opening than a Naruto opening.\n* I'm not sure if it's just the look, but the feel of this series is instantly different. It's unmistakably Naruto, but it does feel distinct. The action scenes made it closer to the original series, but still with a more distinct flair.\n* ALRIGHT HINATA AND HIMAWARI FIRST EPISODE, tybg\n* Wait... Hold on, Boruto has a byakugan/tenseigan already? Or whatever that thing on his right eye is supposed to be? Then why didn't he use it in the fucking movie? Ugh... I'm not sure if he has control over it or not, but he seems to at least realize what's going on so the fact that this isn't even mentioned is really, really annoying. Please don't add shit like this when this is supposed to be pre-movie, it does nothing but add more bullshit.\n* Boruto got Denki to stop being possessed with like, 3 lines. You thought Naruto was a master talk-no-jutsu-er before? This kid is going to put entire nations to their knees by just opening his mouth when he grows up.\n* The animation drop off is IMMEDIATELY noticeable in that preview. I knew a consistent quality was just a pipe dream. The aesthetic seems to remain though, which is good.\n\nIt's kinda hard to say all that much since not really all that much happens to begin with, mostly it's stuff being setup for other episodes, but barring the annoyingly quick way Boruto resolves the possession thing and his eye, I enjoyed this a fair bit. It's way too damn early to know if it'll actually be any good (Especially since this episode is clearly setting up a lot of stuff), and if I'll stick around with it, but so far, so good."

It really reminded be of Naruto before it got too grandiose, and seems to be almost just as fun as I remember the old Naruto to be. It was fun to see all the characters from the old days be the adults of our new group of characters, and overall the episode was fun and quirky. The bright colors made the world look great and I like the way technology was incorporated into the world to make it feel more modern. I'm not sure what to think of the possessed thing, and I hope the show doesn't build a grandiose plot too quickly. Overall a fun pilot, surprisingly, and it's fun to watch something like this once in a while. \n\nI hope this show stays on the Naruto part 1 route for a while and doesn't move onto a bigger plot too quickly. When I watched Naruto I liked it the best when it was a lighter show and wasn't about big wars or grandiose stories. I hope to see more of this show the way it is now, and doesn't give me any reason to drop it like Shippuden did."

It's a great start to the story. Feels pretty nostalgic like when I watched the original Naruto growing up. Not sure how I feel about the Kawaki storyline but I guess we'll get there eventually. Anyways, as others have pointed out the animation is pretty good so hopefully they can keep that up. All in all, i'd give it an 8/10 so far."

   "text": "I'm real excited for this. I still think Boruto (the TV anime, I *loved* the movie) didn't need to exist but after the first episode I've already warmed up to it. I'm excited to see more of the Hidden Leaf Village.\n\nI'm conflicted on Naruto's suggested death during the beginning part. On one hand I think that's an incredibly bold move to kill off a character they've spent a decade building up and if utilised correctly it could *the* biggest, most emotional, most significant death in all of anime history. On the other hand I like Naruto and I don't want to see him die. Boruto's outfit also seems to suggest Sasuke is dead and he passed his outfit onto him. I don't see how both of them could reasonably die.\n\nSince I've already seen the Boruto film I like this cast already. Boruto is an interesting contrast to Naruto, Himawari's a cutie, Sarada is a fun foil to Boruto without being entirely negative etc. I'm excited to see the new characters as well as the changing dynamics of the old characters such as Hinata as a mother or Konohamaru and Moegi as teachers.\n\nOne thing I really like is seeing Boruto translated into the Naruto anime art style. I couldn't read the manga since the art was so radically different to what I was used to and I thought it wasn't as good, so being able to watch it like this is enjoyable.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of [Boruto's design in the part at the beginning](http://i.imgur.com/FqbUF6S.jpg). It looks *way* too convoluted with the way it combines Naruto and Sasuke's outfits as well as one special eye and tribal tattoos.\n\nAlso did anybody else notice this [Narutonic Water](http://i.imgur.com/s3YDR2K.jpg) that Boruto was drinking?"

The tattoos are one of those things. Personally I thought the beginning was a step in a very weird and new direction. Most of naruto was kind of based on the anything-can-happen aspect whereas in this new series we have an absolute point that we are heading towards. Again, not sure if I'm a fan of it yet but I'm hoping the eventual explanation is worth the wait. I agree completely on your opinion of naruto's implied death and thinking about it actually makes me want to cry. \n\nI personally found Boruto's older version very visually appealing whereas I thought Naruto's older self was a bit overdone and-yeah I'll say it- sort of ugly imo. The incorporation of the parents clothing and styles is also something I like with this 'next generation'. \n\nI didn't notice the narutonic water but that's fucking hilarious and I am going to have to keep my eye out for more easter eggs like that.

   "text": "Hey guys I have a theory on how Boruto is gonna play out!\nFirst of all the episode was awesome and people are wondering about Borutos \"Tenseigan\" and how it could be since he needs otsutsuki chakra!\nHere is where my theory begins, in the episode where Boruto sees Denki walking all by himself he notices a purple serpent like snake bite him when his dojutsu activates! Well if anyone noticed, that snake resembles the same snakes that appear when Mitsuki activates his sage mode! Like the resemblance is uncanny!\nAnd then Mitsuki looks exactly like Toneri, again another uncanny resemblance! And as everyone is aware, Mitsuki was created by Orochimaru to be the perfect shinobi! My guess is that Orochimaru got cells from Toneri somehow and based Mitsuki out of him, giving Mitsuki Otsutsuki chakra! Mitsukis sage mode, and Toneri's tenseigan mode look similar as well!\nI bet that the way Boruto activated his Tensigan was that somehow Mitsuki \"bit\" boruto giving him Otsutsuki chakra, the same way Orochimaru applies the curse mark! Since its been stated that Mitsuki can only activate Sage mode subconsciously, I dont think he was aware of what was going on!\nIt has also been stated that Orochimaru let Mitsuki escape so he can follow his own path, but guided him towards Boruto!\nThe theory goes on to say that Mitsuki gives Boruto a sort of curse mark, explaining his future tattoos, and why he is able to activate the tenseigan since he already has hyuga chakra!\nI just thought about another thing! Boruto doesnt acquire the full tenseigan because he wont take anybody's eye, but instead only unlocks a partial tenseigan! His eye resembles a partial tenseigan more than the actual byakugan, thats why I believe its not the byakugan\nPlease feel free to comment on what yall think about my theory and add stuff if yall want!"

Going in I was worried Boruto would just be a Naruto clone but there is quite a lot different about his character and personality that makes him a joy to watch.  For one, I'm assuming Naruto taught him some ninjutsu such as shadow clones cause he doesn't suck at being a ninja, even though he has inherited some of his dads clumsiness.  The best part so far is how they've depicted the setting and the changes it's gone through.  The music reflects on those changes too as I heard some more techno sounding beats mixed in with the traditional Naruto sound.  I'm not too happy with the beginning scene of showcasing Boruto many years in the future because it appeared to pretty much spoil Naruto's inevitable death so now I'm going to be anxious every time Naruto gets' in a battle.  I do like how that scene was conveying to me that yeah this gon be a long series.

Im sure it has allot of significance in the manga. but it just made me worry about this show.\n\nIt makes it feel like this will have the same bullshit level of power scaling as Sippuden, and that's what killed Shippuden for me.  \n\n\n\nThe Tattoos looked pretty cool though, i feel like it is going to be some kind of new science mixed with Jutsu, otherwise that would mean these characters got up to the power level, if not stronger than Naruto and that doesn't seem possible through any normal means. at least not that fast.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, I LOVE how Boruto has no interest in being a ninja. It was the way of life for the generation directly before him, but he doesn't care. The dynamic of Naruto, someone who spent his entire life striving to be the greatest ninja, to be able to be part of and protect the village that shunned him as a child, having a kid who doesn't think ninja are even cool let alone needed.\n\n\nI'm mostly hyped to see the motivations and desires of these kids as the show progresses. and I hope it doesn't jump into things too quickly, like whatever that shadow thing was the possessed glasses kid."

I think this is the story of what could've happened if Naruto's parents were alive:\n\n* Father's the Hokage, check.\n* Mother gets terrifying when angry, check.\n* Little sister (maybe, just give them some time, and Naruto could've had a little brother or sister), check.\n\nIt's like Naruto lived a normal life, perhaps he wouldn't even wanted to be the Hokage if he had his father as one, and without Kurama I don't think he would be strong at all. I'm saying this because I have hope in this new generation, I already have no way to know what is Boruto gonna do (manga readers shut up), he just wants to be able to choose."
