I just like VLC... but the difference is really noticeable in this [version](https://www.reddit.com/r/endcard/comments/6bi6mg/rokudenashi_majitsu_koushi_to_akashic_records/) from /r/endcard.\n\n\nAkashic Records is [837p source](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/65wqeu/spring_2017_anime_resolution_chart/), so 720p shouldn't really make a large difference if it's encoded well."

It's likely 1080p master downscaled to 720p, and another important factor is that 720p has much lower bitrate, so you have a lot more artifacts than in 1080p source, so it's not only resolution.\n\nThe one you linked from r/endcard is a lot more detailed and sharper, and is from 1080p version. Here i'll upload screenshot from [1080p CR](http://i.imgur.com/aS8bu0m.png). "

Rumia is adorable as always, the dynamics among the cast are building nicely, and this arc may just be the start of something bigger for the overall series. \n\nRe=L's build up to her freak out at the end of the episode was particularly stand out. It was nicely tied in with the rest of the episode and feels like it'll pan out in interesting repercussions for the rest of the show, if they don't just \"friendship\" it away. "
