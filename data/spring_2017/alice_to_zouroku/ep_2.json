You can feel the maturity of the adults as well as the fear and immaturity of the children and they are all acting in accordance. \n\nWonderland is just amazing as well, stunning even. I love how it all makes sense but no sense at the same time and how she has all of her \"memories\" contained or recreated in certain areas. \n\nA real question is what is that mansion they stayed in, it was never shown before so what memory does it originate from?"

The characters, even Sana, realizing that there are things worth loving about that \"imperfect\" world nonetheless. Maybe that's what Wonderland needed to learn -- that it isn't human to be \"perfect\" but it is human to \"love one another.\" "
