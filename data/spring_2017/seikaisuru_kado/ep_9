Thus I believe Shindo and Zashunina will stay in control due to overwhelming negotiation power. Realistically the show will probably present a more graceful approach than bombing the world, but a still end in a no-options situation"

I can't imagine wam itself is any different and am going to have significant problems with the world building if it is), and as far as I know most things that do heat up the world are the things involved in energy production.\n\nEnergy *is* heat. When we talk about climate change we talk about heating up the world, but ultimately that just describes the physical consequence of an energy surplus.\n\nImagine the entire Earth as a box. You can put energy in and take energy out. In reality, there are only a few sources of energy in our system: that produced by the decay of radioactive isotopes, energy left over from the formation of the earth, and solar radiation (aka light and heat). The only notable way for energy to leave the system is via radiation to space (again, via light and heat).\n\nHere's how it looks:\n\n    \u250c                         \u2510\n    | solar radiation         |\n    | radioactive decay       | --> [ Earth system ] --> [ radiation to space ]\n    | leftover from formation |\n    \u2514                         \u2518\n\nIf the sum of the energy of the inputs is 100 units a year, and the total amount of energy of the outputs is 90 units a year, then that means that each year we add 10 units of energy to the Earth system.\n\nFossil fuels are an issue because as we burn carbon, we reduce the amount of energy that the Earth is able to radiate to space. (Some of the escaping energy is reflected back off the carbon in the atmosphere, reentering the system.) As the amount of energy in the system increases, we experience higher temperatures (because energy is heat!), which has other effects on the system (ex: as polar ice melts, the albedo (reflectance) of the Earth decreases and more solar energy enters the system).\n\nSo that's real life. If we suddenly had an infinite clean energy source, we could stop adding carbon to the atmosphere. Perhaps we would be able to develop tech to scrub all of the greenhouse gases currently up there, or tech to increase the albedo of the Earth. Ultimately none of this would matter, because the system would now look like this:\n\n    [ infinite energy ] --> [ Earth system ] --> [ finite radiation to space ]\n\nWith infinite energy input, it wouldn't matter how much energy we tried to output. It wouldn't be enough. You can't pour an infinite amount of something into a finite box and expect the box to hold. Our only hope at that point would be to expand to other planets.\n\n....sorry for vomiting all this science at you."

Here's how wiki defines it :\n\n> Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average **temperature** of the Earth's climate system\n\nNow, consider the term **temperature** since an increase in it's value is what's troubling us. Where does this **temperature** come from? In the words of Noble Prize winning physicist Richard Feynman it's the \"[jiggling of atoms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3pYRn5j7oI)\", in the atmosphere. So, the more the atoms in the atmosphere jiggle, the more the temperature of the atmosphere.\n\njiggling|temperature|\n:--|:--|\nincreases|increases|\n||\n\nNow, let us agree to your point that we switched wam with the conventional means of producing energy, i.e., we stopped burning coal altogether, i.e., no more greenhouse gases and no more \"loose energy\" into the system.\n\nLet us assume that the temperature of the Earth's atmosphere is T right before we plugged in the wam.\n\nAfter plugging in the wam, we draw electricity from it, and use it to power, say, a fan. What does a fan do? The electrical energy is converted into mechanical energy in the form of the motion of the blades. Now when these blades move, they strike the atoms present in the air around them, thus, imparting kinetic energy to them, which, then, strike the atoms around them, and so on.\n\nSo, the atoms that were previously \"jiggling\" less, i.e., had less kinetic energy, are now \"jiggling\" more, i.e., have more kinetic energy.\n\nAnd as we previously established, more jiggling = more temperature. So, the temperature of the Earth has \"increased\" to T+ something, say X (which is a minuscule amount).\n\nSo what? It is minuscule, very small, and can't possibly have an impact. But that's just one fan. We use a lot more appliances than that. And they all contribute to the \"jiggling\" of atoms. For example, a light-bulb releases heat and light in the form of photons, which \"strike\" the atoms around the bulb, get absorbed by them, and make them \"jiggle\" more.\n\nEnergy Drawn|Jiggling|Temperature|\n:--|:--|:--|\nincreases|increases|increases|\n|||\n\nSo, this global warming that we're talking about, doesn't arise from the byproduct of burning coal, i.e., the release of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the environment (and loose energy). But with the utilization of an external infinite source of energy over \"long\" periods of time.\n\n\"Umm.. so what? We stopped burning coal right? So we're not injecting as much \"loose energy\" into the system.\" Yes, but the coal we burn is finite, while the amount of energy supplied by wam is infinite. And it's not like the humans will just sit on their asses and not totally abuse this newfound source of infinite energy. The amount drawn will only increase over time, and with it, the jiggling, hence, the temperature."

   "text": "You are viewing things separately from the system i.e., the Earth. You're also considering different forms of energy as separate (wasted heat, coal, geothermal, etc). While the point I'm trying to make considers all forms of energy on Earth (matter and radiation). Remember Einstein's equation, E=mc^2. Basically says that matter is just another form of energy.\n\nNow, let us, mathematically, convert all of Earth's matter into energy and add up all other forms of energy (assume for this instance that the Earth as a system is completely isolated). Assign this a value, say X Joules. Now, a Wam is *not* a part of the Earth, or of this universe. It simply acts as a \"boundary object\", between the two universes. So any amount of electricity we draw from it, comes from the other side and not from our universe. Let us assign that a value of Y joules.\n\nNow in case of using any conventional means of converting energy (coal, oil, gas, nuclear, etc), we will be using the materials **from** the Earth. So, by the law of conservation of energy, no matter how inefficient the conversion, the total amount of energy in consideration remains constant. And we assigned it a value of X Joules. So the total energy of Earth remains X Joule **before** and **after** the conversion.\n\nBut in the case of a Wam. The total energy will be X plus whatever amount of energy you draw from the other side, which we assumed as Y. So, the total energy of the Earth (after using Wam) will be (X+Y) Joules. Now it is clear that,\n\n(X+Y)>X.\n\nSo, the total energy in the case of a wam **increases**. Using the law of conservation of energy, we can deduce that this excess energy can only be converted in different forms. And since converting energy directly into matter is not possible for humanity, this excess energy will most probably be converted to other forms which directly or indirectly end up as Heat. Hence the global warming."

Total Energy by itself never hurt anyone, it's the form the energy takes and how it's distributed that causes issues.  A closed system without any increase or decrease of total energy will eventually reach max entropy.   That's a bad thing for anyone inside the system.  A closed system with increasing total energy can solve the issue with proper use of the energy (though I guess at that point the system is technically no longer closed?)"

So if more people start watching TV and running air conditioners because the energy is free, that means more waste heat gets dumped into the atmosphere."

But I disagree with that last part:\n\n`[ infinite energy ] --> [ Earth system ] --> [ finite radiation to space ]`\n\nWam doesn't give infinite energy, it gives exactly the right amount of energy to power what's connected to it. So it would definitely add more heat to Earth out of nowhere, but it won't be infinite heat. With unlimited energy supply, some new engineering projects on an immense scale would be possible, so maybe it would be possible to create a way to artificially remove all the excess energy away from Earth. Maybe create a planet-sized radiator even? With unlimited energy and the right technology, it would be possible to even create matter out of nothing."

I was more chemistry/organic chemistry XD\n\nMmm, I think the part where I'm getting caught up is the part where wam doesn't follow our world's physics. Or at least, Kado doesn't, and I'm making the assumption that neither does wam since it's from the same place. While I suppose that once it appears in our world, the energy from wam likely becomes the same as any other energy and thus produces heat as it travels to and then powers whatever, those wam ball things don't sit there giving off energy all the time. They only give energy when hooked up to a circuit, and then only exactly as much energy as that circuit needs. With that kind of efficiency, it seems to me like it would be an overall reduction in, I guess really, energy, since our current methods of energy production that I'm aware of give off a fair amount of unwanted heat energy just making the desired electrical energy. Perhaps after a really long period of time we'd have created a ton more things we want powered now that we have the means to power them all for free and that could eventually cause problems, but it wouldn't be right away and I can't predict how much energy we'd end up using, so I can't predict if it would be less than the radiation to space. \n\nOn the other hand, thinking it through in this way makes it seems clear that the more wam ball things available, the better, since the less energy will be lost as heat as it travels from the wam to the thing using the energy and it wouldn't change the amount of energy coming from wam at all.\n\nEDIT: Ah, someone else said a cycley thing. I guess that makes sense. .... Could wam be used to remove energy too? You'd think..."

They act as an energy conduit between our universe and the anisotropic, and presumably they convert the weird 4D energy into the kind of energy common to our universe so that we can use it.\n\n>With that kind of efficiency, it seems to me like it would be an overall reduction in, I guess really, energy, since our current methods of energy production that I'm aware of give off a fair amount of unwanted heat energy just making the desired electrical energy.\n\nHere's the problem, though. Even with increased efficiency, we would likely end up drawing much more energy from the wam than we current use.\n\nOur energy system vastly underserves the total energy demands of the species as a whole. To put it into perspective: in 2008 the average American used 87,216 kWh, the average human (worldwide) used 21,283 kWh, and the total usage worldwide was 142.3 TWh. If every human used as much energy as the average American, the total usage worldwide would increase to 583.3 TWh, or 410%!\n\n(Is it cruel to suggest that we cannot give all members of our species a first-world, industrialized lifestyle?

In 2002, this was more energy in one hour than the world used in one year.\"\nThe reason human-driven climate change is a problem is our greenhouse gas production is trapping more solar energy.  The actual heat produced from human energy consumption is a drop in the bucket compared to the incoming solar energy.  \nIf wams allow us to drastically reduce greenhouse gase production so we're trapping less of that insane amount of energy, we can afford a hell of a lot more energy consumption without it becoming an issue."

If you really break it down, all of it, in all of it's entirety -\n the laws, policies, governments, **everything** was done by, and **is**, its **people**. People who came together and formed this community, this organisation, for their own good and survival, and bestowed upon it the title of a \"country\".    \nCountries, tribes, clans, communities, they are all \"ideas\" which originated from a collective of people. It is nothing more than a name, a label that a lot of people identify themselves with. At it's core, it serves the purpose of survival of the ~~species~~the small number of people in it. But with all the advances in \"civilisation\" so far, this \"idea\" has grown way beyond it's intended purpose and has gained far more power than necessary.\n\nPeople started living in tribes because it safeguarded them from predators, and living in communities ensured their survival, especially in the food department (men hunting in groups while women gather). We weren't always at the top of the food chain. Then we moved on to farming and learning how to better use weapons, and as population grew, we developed governing systems, and advances in science (catapults, rams, smithing techniques to gunpowder later on). With scarce resources, tribes and clans often fought each other for land, and there were bloody wars and massacres.\n\nCompared to that, the times we live in now, are completely different. We have made so many advances in the field of science and technology, that if we really want to, idealistically speaking, we can feed every single human being on the planet, provide them with shelter and other basic necessities of life. We have enough resources, that if we divide them among ourselves, it'll be enough for everyone.\n\nSo, what is stopping us? Countries. Not directly, but that's what we pin the blame on. Back then, trying to put the whole planet under one rule was a big thing (though for selfish egotistic reasons). But now, we are more worried about immigrants taking our jobs.    \nAnother big example is money, with all the countries and their own currencies with different values.\n\nIt is not that we *can't* do it, that we can't come together as a species and establish a single governing body which considers the interests of humanity as a whole. It's that we *don't want to*.    \nIt's not just our self-centered nature. It also has to do with the psychology. Because with the establishment of countries, we have established a kind of society which divides people into different classes. There's top people, middle people, and bottom people. There can't be any top people without the bottom people and bottom people without the top people. And the middle ones just don't know where they belong so they pretend. But everybody wants to be in the top class.\n\nThis hierarchy is projected globally in the form of countries. There's developed countries, developing countries and poor third world countries. The ones at the top hoard all resources, while those at the bottom are barely making it through (those in the middle are just a mess as always, so they immigrate). On top of which they have the nerve to act like they are trying to \"save\" those poor countries.\n\nNow what was the original purpose of countries?    \nThat's the idea gaining power beyond it's definition.\n\n***\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long rant."

You'd have to know each word you wanted to use, as well as how much space they will occupy.\" can be viewed as experiencing past, present and future simultaneously. Where \"what you want to write, i.e., the words\" is the \"past\" information (as you've already thought about it before starting), \"the act of writing\" is the present information, and \"knowing how much space the sentence occupies when finished\" is the future information.\n\nThe \"inefficiency\" that we're talking about would be when the word \"tool\" was confused with \"weapon\". And you know the shitstorm it caused in the movie. So, when Dr. Louise Banks, after the end of the movie, goes on to teach the heptopod's language as the \"universal\" language, she is simply teaching a \"translation\" of that language, or teaching it in \"relation\" to the English language (or some other \"human\" language). And not how it really is. To truly learn the language without any discrepancies of translation you'd have to be a newborn baby, and then grow up with the heltopods, learning their language.\n\nStill, regardless of the \"perception\" of time in two different languages, the \"inefficiency\" remains in terms of transmission.\n\nSo maybe the language from Arrival won't be so helpful in that aspect. But we don't know what that language really is, as we only know it translated into English, so I could be wrong and maybe the heptopods have already dealt with the issue of \"inefficiency\". Still, we'd have to ditch English altogether and have babies learn the heptopod's language since birth."

But when \"talking to someone who doesn't speak the language\", the listener won't be able to understand what you're saying, regardless of whether or not **his** native language has a different form of that phrase, because he is not familiar with **your** language. And in teaching him your language, you'll end up teaching him the explanations of every single word of that \"sitting in a chair...doing it\" statement. It only works when the speaker and the listener are communicating in the same language and are aware of the context. And even then \"suits you\" is related to your image of the person, and not the person in consideration.\n\nOur human language is just a collection of labels, and it defines everything in terms of everything else. So, when a conversation starts approaching absolute concepts, it starts to crumble. In fact, if you break apart a simple statement, you'll soon find how fascinatingly ambiguous and incomprehensible it is. Take this for example : \"The sun rises in the east.\"\n\nIgnore for a moment, the science that the sun doesn't rises, it's the Earth spinning. \"Rise\" doesn't mean anything without \"fall\", or \"ascend\" without \"descend\". But if you try to define the word independently without being dependent on its opposite (directly or indirectly), you'll fail, every time.\n\n> But yes, being able to just project our pure thoughts (not the ones we've stuck words to, but the thought itself) would be the most efficient.\n\nThat would be fascinating. If you think about it, it might require letting go of \"ego\" (of the individual nature) and an understanding that we're all one. Because as long as there's a boundary between me and you, the information I transmit will be distorted, altered, warped, when it passes through those boundaries. But if you and I are one and the same, the information can flow freely.\n\nJust a fleeting thought. Not sure if it makes \"sense\"."

   "text": "> do you ever try thinking things without thinking words?\n\nIsn't that we all do from day one? Since birth, a child is able to perceive \"reality\" without needing a language of words. While babies can recognise sounds of their parents and respond to certain patterns, they can't \"make sense\" of speech, and hence, language. This is because the mind of a child is like a sponge - it absorbs whatever is thrown at it, processes it (picking out patterns and stuff), and then sends it out in whatever way it can (in a monkey see, monkey do way). You can often \"see\" a baby think. Try talking to an infant and see what happens. They wave their arms, make faces, strange sounds, go spastic, doing whatever they can to \"communicate\". Now that baby is thinking, even though he doesn't know the English language or words.\n\nAnd this brings us to the adults. When you \"think about\" something that smells nice, is it the words \"smell\" & \"nice\" that you're thinking? Or is the past experience, a feeling you once had which \"felt\" nice?\n\nWe don't \"think\" in words, we think in past experiences, experiences which are a combination of various stimuli. Right now, this sentence that you're reading. As soon as you complete a sentence (or sometimes even half a sentence) you \"understand\" it's meaning (interpret would be a more accurate description). Is it because of the words? Or is it because of the pattern of the words, where every word is associated to a past experience, which builds up an image of sorts. Our brains are so good (and fast) at this association that we get the illusion that we're thinking in words, as if reading it out loud in our head (but it's more along the lines of \"recalling\" past experiences).\n\nNow,\n\n> so if people communicated that way, conversations would be done in, like, an instant.\n\nA conversation isn't just the \"transmission\" of information, it also involves \"processing\" of that information by the receiver (i.e., interpretation). Just because the information is \"transmitted\" instantly, doesn't mean it will be \"processed\" instantly. This happens to us every time we \"see\" something. In case of \"seeing\", say a painting, the \"information\" in the form of light, is transmitted \"almost instantaneously\" (for the purpose of this discussion) to our retinas and then to our brain. But it takes time for our brain to \"put together\" or to \"process\" that information into something meaningful.\n\nSo, when you look at page in a book, do you comprehend it instantly? After all, everything there is to \"see\" on that page, has already been transmitted into your head (in the form of an image). The answer is no. Because your brain hasn't \"processed\" it yet. The processing is what takes time here. And as time passes, you get better at it.\n\n>  I appreciate efficiency and saving time and all that, but it really doesn't sound fun when taken to that extreme.\n\nI can't really say what it would be like using such a mode of communication. But I think it is too early to assume that it won't be fun."

To quote [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/aug/21/science-little-voice-head-hearing-voices-inner-speech),\n\n> Most of us will be familiar with the experience of silently talking to ourselves in our head. Perhaps you\u2019re at the supermarket and realise that you\u2019ve forgotten to pick up something you needed. \u201cMilk!\u201d you might say to yourself. Or maybe you\u2019ve got an important meeting with your boss later in the day, and you\u2019re simulating \u2013 silently in your head \u2013 how you think the conversation might go, possibly hearing both your own voice and your boss\u2019s voice responding. This is the phenomenon that psychologists call \u201cinner speech\u201d.\n\nWhat's particularly interesting here, is this part :\n\n> We have known for about a century that inner speech is accompanied by tiny muscular movements in the larynx, detectable by a technique known as electromyography. In the 1990s, neuroscientists used functional neuroimaging to demonstrate that areas such as the left inferior frontal gyrus (Broca\u2019s area), which are active when we speak out loud, are also active during inner speech. So the evidence that inner speech and speaking out loud share similar brain mechanisms seems pretty convincing\n\nTo put it simply, what's going on is that when you're \"thinking in words\" your brain is \"recalling\" the experience of \"speech\", along with whatever it is that you're thinking about. You're only \"feeling\" that you're thinking in words, but the actual process behind it is different. Consider this :\n\n> Take a second to think about something. It can be any kind of thought. Now when you are thinking what do the thoughts seem to be within your mind? Are they words and language or something else? You probably would think words because that is how they appear to be within our minds, but when it comes to our thoughts we are actually thinking in ideas and meanings also called semantics. Semantics are the relationship between symbols and their intended meaning, in this case the words and their meaning.\n\n> So perhaps a mix is more accurate?\n\nSomewhat, yes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n> Being able to directly send memories and experiences to someone else sounds a bit alarming now that I'm thinking on it, because like, if you receive them exactly how the other person experienced them, how could you be sure you hadn't experienced it yourself?\n\nWe seem to have strayed quite far away from our initial point (of language and communication to now, memory) but its kinda fun to speculate so I'll keep going.\n\nWhat you're describing is something that happens to us quite often. It is defined as \"Misattribution of memory\" and is said to be one of the \"[seven sins of memory](http://www.apa.org/monitor/oct03/sins.aspx)\".\n\n> Misattribution of Memory refers to the ability to remember information correctly, but being wrong about the source of that information.\n\nSo, yeah, it is kinda scary. But the idea I talked about initially, assumed that there isn't a boundary between me and you.\n\n> Because as long as there's a boundary between me and you, the information I transmit will be distorted, altered, warped, when it passes through those boundaries.\n\nIn your statement of \"how could you be sure you hadn't experienced it yourself?\", you are making a distinction between \"the other person\" and \"yourself\", thus creating a boundary between the two. And that's why there is a \"discrepancy\" (as the source of origin of that information).\n\nIn the idea where \"you\" and \"me\" are one, it would be as if we both have experienced the same thing, simultaneously. Which would be more along the lines of information being transferred with 100% efficiency. It sounds like what you just said, but it is quite different, though this \"language\" that we are using makes it hard to explain. Now if only I could transmit that idea with 100% efficiency.\n\nP.S. Thank you for carrying the conversation so far, it's been real fun to think about all these things. Learned a lot."

The energy is transferred from coal \u2192 water (which turns into steam) \u2192 to the rotating turbine \u2192 bulb (as electricity). The bulb then releases radiation (light and heat) and that radiation is absorbed by everything else in the surroundings (you, the tress, etc).\n\nNow, the fossil fuel we burnt was initially formed by organic life (plants and animals) buried under in the ground long ago. And the radiation our bulb releases, is finally absorbed by the same life. This completes the circle, with the total energy of our system as a constant.\n\nBut if the bulb was being powered by a Wam. The energy is coming from a different universe. But, instead of returning back to where it came from (as in the previous case), it remains here. So you have a constant stream of energy being dumped into the Earth's \"system\". And since this \"foreign\" energy is in the form of electricity and not matter, it will be ultimately released into the Earth's atmosphere as electromagnetic radiation, or heat, leading to an overall increase in temperature."

However, that doesn't mean much genetically since those traits can be expressed outside that group, and even people inside the group can have widely variable genetic differences.

Ancestry is actually mostly derived from looking at Mitochondria genes which are highly conserved and very slowly change across multiple generations. These can give an indication of where someones very distance ancestors came from, but they don't really confer any phenotypical changes that we could see that allow us to categorise people into races. \n\nRace is, however like you said, an interchangeable term for ethnicity, a social and cultural term for people sharing similar backgrounds, ancestries, and traits.

People saw people who clearly looked very different than them and assumed greater differences than there were. But race is also used, currently speaking, as a descriptor, often regarding skin color, even if the boundaries are pretty blurred in a lot of cases. It's still used on forms and in the common vernacular. It's not going to suddenly disappear just because the assumptions of specific genetics turn out to be wrong.

If it's just the sudden reduction of CO2 producing energy sources being used causing a shock to the planets' various systems, it would seem like they'd just need to implement wam slowly. But there's a lot of other problems in implementing them - they still require a circuit, and our infrastructure isn't all connected and even beyond that there's things like watches and whatnot. You can't possibly use individual wam for everything that would need it, so we'd have to change the way everything's done. Initially, that'd be really expensive and time-consuming, even if it saved costs massively in the long run. So I think it'd be hard to suddenly implement them worldwide anyway. \n\nI do agree it'd be good to understand them.

The Wam are supposed to pull out the amount of energy needed, so it would function similar to how it does nowadays but with no need for creating excess energy in case use goes up.\n\nThe problem being that most energy plant workers would be out of  a job, and any workers/scientists involved with energy production would be out of a job in a fairly short term scale. I would assume with free energy it would even increase the rate of automation, since now you don't even need to pay for the energy your robots use.

One of the ministers straight up said that if some other country had all the Wam, they would've acted in the same manner.\n\nAs for the UN aspect, you are misinterpreting the reasons behind their judgement. This was a security council decision, controlled by the 5 permanent members in their own self interests. A monopoly on Wam effectively makes you a world power and no existing power wants to deal with that. The wide distribution would effectively bankrupt many countries because the energy industry accounts for roughly 10% of the worlds expenditure (Russia and USA being the big losers from the security council). Either option is unacceptable to existing world powers, so they resort to uniting in order to bully Japan into submission.\n\nHowever this comes back to the very first idea they introduced. Negotiation.\n\n>What's best for you is giving both parties something in their interest.\n\nThis episode set the stage of the conflict. Both parties have different interests and the goal is to find a solution that best satisfies them both. It's also important to note that in this situation, Japan have essentially become an extension/puppet of zaShunina. It's his goals they are looking at pushing, not their own. They were **told** to share the bread.\n\nAs of yet we don't know if zaShunina has any hidden motives, which is one of the things that makes this show interesting. We instinctively think that this is too good to be true.\n\n"

It's probably a writing oversight or inconsequential, but it would be kind of cool there was some significance to the lone wam that wasn't in a pair...\n\nI've been thinking of the \"pairs\" of wam as two parts of a single four-dimensional object. (zaShunina said something to this effect in the last episode). So if there are 167 wam, what we see in our world is 167 pairs, or 334 individual spheres.\n\nIf you aren't used to visualizing 4D objects in 3D space:\n\n* Imagine a 3D sphere passing through a 2D plane. From the POV of the plane, a point appears, grows into a circle, grows wider, shrinks, and then disappears. [Enjoy this crappy MS Paint drawing demonstrating this.](https://vgy.me/QpNzvM.gif) \n\n* Now imagine a 4D sphere passing through the third dimension. From our third-dimensional POV, we would see a point appear, grow into a sphere, grow larger, shrink, and then disappear. (This is why when zaShunina moves his arms in and out of the higher dimensions, they appear to be growing and shrinking.)\n\n* Now imagine a 3D curved pipe cutting through a 2D plane. Upon the plane would be projected [two circles](https://vgy.me/yk9LrD.png). Although the plane experiences the pipe as two separate objects, in truth they are part of a single object.\n\n* Now, imagine a similar 4D \"pipe\" cutting through the third dimension. We would observe this pipe as two separate objects (two spheres), but in truth they would be part of a single object. That's the wam."

Those MS Paint drawings are great and helped my tiny brain understand 4D interactions better. It's interesting how those Wam could be the same object, but not in the way we can visualize in 3D.\n\nI love the nods this show gives to higher dimensional geometry with zaShunina's arms and the Wam. Yaha-kui zaShunia said something along the lines of, \"Novo is adjacent to every point in 3D space\" as an explanation of how he could \"teleport\" his arms around at will. So it really is a situation quite similar to how a 3D being can jump in and out of a 2D plane using the z-axis, which is adjacent to every point in a 2D plane."

Now, when you attach the two terminals/wires of an electrical device to these wams, what you do is you give the electrons a \"path\" to move, a path with some kind of \"resistance\" (or load). And as the electrons pass through that resistance, they supply the power to the device. So we say that the device is \"drawing power\" from the source.\n\nNow, where did this \"power\" come from? The wam. But where will this power go to now, from the electric device? If it is a light bulb, then it gives off heat and light. If it's to move an electric motor, it is in the form of kinetic energy. Ultimately, it is retained by \"our\" universe. So, in the end, energy is \"added\" to our system from an external source. And since we have the law of conservation of energy here, this \"foreign\" energy, which, once introduced into our universe, cannot be destroyed. It can only change forms.\n\nI think the confusion is caused by the nature of the wams. You might be treating it as a device, but it is just a \"gateway\" or a \"channel\" to the other dimension/universe, through which, energy can flow into our dimension/universe in the form of electricity."

   "text": "UGH, I LOVE THIS SHOW.\n\n> *The resolve.. to drop a bomb on this world.*\n\nThat line gave me goosebumps. I'm sure zaShunina isn't suggesting anything malicious - far from it. He probably has some plan in order to break down the 'country' construct and try to unify humanity under one banner - clearly that would require something ground-breaking, so to speak. A complete paradigm shift. However, the image of the two balls/bombs dropping hinted at the Nagasaki and Hiroshima bombings - also bombings, incidentally, which shook the world and changed out collective outlook toward war overnight. The fact that the roles are now reversed.. this must be a powerful idea to a Japanese audience that still carries scars from that war.\n\nI wonder if zaShunina claiming Japan to be the most empathic country (I love this rationalization though. I'm so sick of ALL sci-fi stories being set in the US that this is practically refreshing) is simply an experiment he's conducting. When we praise someone openly or have high expectations of them, that person may feel more inspired to behave in order to live up to those expectations. It's entirely possible that zaSh is manipulating the Japanese govt that way, and making them behave better than they usually would have.\n"

That is another minor large issue. It could be for all humanity, but people will still be denied access to it, be it paywall or otherwise."
