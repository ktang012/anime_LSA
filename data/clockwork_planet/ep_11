But I think maybe Kanon?  Both versions are really a good primer for those sorts of \"faces, bodies, hair, clothes, etc. - one with less spurned artists - but I've only seen 2006 (the good one), and 2003 (I think? Somewhere in there) is really the one you'd want to look at.\n\nBut really, you've got two shows airing right now that have interesting aspects on CG, in general: This, with basically none - or negligible - CGI and Berserk, which uses it far too often to make it seem like any time was put in in the first place."

   "text": "There are a lot of really odd things about this anime, but I.. kind of liked this episode?\n\nMore specifically, I like the blonde girl's character.  She is \"willful\" as they put it in the show, but she takes her job very seriously, isn't overly full of herself and is really determined.  She's a really enjoyable character.  MC-kun and RyuZU are another story though, frankly I could barely focus on the show at all during their scenes, which had a whole bunch of nothing going on.  At least at this point, I feel like the show would be better if they were gone entirely.\n\nThere's also some weird shit that just kind of slides by because the whole thing is so odd- Halter just picks up a huge fucking robot and throws it? wtf?  Floor 24 is over 70 km down?  Their plan to get to floor 15 is just to literally hop down the 30 km distance, and they can do so quickly enough that it's faster then the elevator? Um, okay, I guess. The military does one specific thing to prevent the Meisters from working, and that's it?  Why bother disconnecting the gear if they're purging the whole thing, if they just blow it up, it can't be repaired in any 41 seconds or probably at all.  If all those robots just shoot the fuck out of that power barrel, I'm pretty sure it wouldn't matter what blondie does.  Even in general all they have to do is keep breaking random stuff, and there's no way the Meisters could keep up, so why don't they? The guild branch head or whoever says \"the military\" controls all the core towers all over the world, is it just one military, or does he mean the military of each individual country?  Not sure any of that makes any sense, but it flies by so fast you don't even really get a chance to process it.  And those are just the things I remember off the top of my head.\n\nSo yeah, curious to see where this goes exactly but I'm reasonably certain it will never really make sense on a larger scale.\n\nAlso, it reminds me a lot of Lances N' Masques, both in the character designs and the overall wtf-ness of the story."

If they know it can't be fixed and that somehow screwing with it will cause the world to be destroyed, or that not purging it will have catastrophic consequences, why not issue an evacuation order?  The only reason not to is so that they can avoid taking the blame for not being able to fix it, but how is that worth the lives of 20 million people?  If they admit they can't fix it, can't they then start the process of bringing in additional help (the Meister guild, for example) so that it doesn't happen in other cities?  Maybe the military isn't so much evil as bureaucratically inept, but the fact that they actively try to prohibit any solutions other then their own by force certainly makes them seem pretty evil.\n\nOh, forgot that the military is trying to blame blondie's family for the problem.  So not only are they incompetent, but they want to ruin the reputation of the other major group that could potentially fix the problems and save millions of lives, instead of working with them, like any rational human beings would in this situation. How totally not evil of them."

   "text": "I had high hopes for this show before the first episode aired, the concept seemed interesting and I love the astetic of clockwork. But after watching these first two episodes all my enthusiasm for this series has been throughly dashed. Aside from the storyline being overall, incredibly mediocre and making little to no sense, the animation is appalling. Characters move unnaturally and the action sequences look like shit. A perfect example of the animation at it's worst is in the first episode when RyuZU jumps down and kills a bunch of robots with her blades. In this scene her blades don't move at all, instead, the animators took the easy way out and animated some ugly slash marks over the enemies to make it seem like she was cutting them up. Another example is in the second episode when Loli tsundere girl is punching her bodyguard. Her punches feel like they have no weight to them because of the fact that each one only uses like three frames of animation. After seeing this most recent episode I can confidently say I will be dropping this show without a second thought."

The art looks outdated but the setting is weird enough and opens up enough questions to make me interested. The little girl doctor seemed annoying at first but her emotional outbreak in the elevator was pretty well done and sort of got me more invested. I love RyuZU's bitchy attitude and her banter with Naoto and he himself is doing what we would all do if we suddenly gained a super android."
