Also, must say that Jeanne gave me The Boss (Metal Gear Solid 3) vibes, while being a better mother by far, which is pretty good in my book.\n\nI really wonder if they can manage to have this entire show with the quality it has right now.

She was never meant to be used to seal Bahamut, but rather, was used to unleash Bahamut. The God Key and the Demon Key were only effective so long as they remained in their respective resting places away from each other. Of course it wouldn't have mattered anyway even if Amira didn't exist, since by the beginning of Genesis, the sealing effect of the Keys on Bahamut had already weakened enough to allow Bahamut to break it forcibly.\")"

   "text": "Alright, I am baffled. I watched the first season as it was airing, so maybe I'm forgetting something, but why are the main characters friendly with Azazel? Best I can recall, he was responsible for killing both Favaro and Kaiser's dads, and was a totally evil demon who only fought against Beelzebub because he was loyal to Lucifer.\n\nYet zombiloli works with him, and Kaizer tries to warn him away when the King gets serious about hunting him. \n\nDemons in this world seem entirely evil and have always been a threat to humanity. I can't say I disagree with the king about conquering them (although the cruelty he allows the slaves to suffer is not right). So why would the protagonists who have suffered at the hands of demons in the past and know it was demon-kind who tried to resurrect Bahamut last time work so closely with one?\n\nSure Azazel's purpose freeing the demon slaves is noble, but he straight up admits to hating humans, wanting to kill them all and return the fear of demon-kind to the race. With that clearly established, I'm having a hard time accepting him as 'one of the gang' like the protagonists, or even viewing him as a sympathetic character.\n\nAll that to say, was there an OVA/light novel/manga explaining any of this. I really enjoy the show otherwise, but Azazel's relationships to the characters confuses me immensely."

So I think that's why they are on friendly terms with him/don't want him to die. I don't think he is 'one of the gang' though. Kaisar also says that he doesn't want revenge (virgin soul ep 2?) so the dad killing is a thing from the past already. Azazel is still the evil sadist from S1 that has not changed but he is leading S2 this time, the story is being told from his point of view so that's why he seems to be the protagonist. That's my 2 cents ^^"
