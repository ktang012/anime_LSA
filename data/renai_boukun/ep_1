Renai Boukun wasn't a comedy anime where every episode is a shiny golden nugget that's indivudually precious, but instead the episodes felt like a treasure chest, where each episode had all these shiny, beautiful things to behold. It was batshit insane all the way through, and I wouldn't have it any other way. One of the best anime of the year for sure."

Sure the animation is very limited and the backgrounds are almost unnexistant, but it's quite remarkable they managed to pull out a 12 episode full 24 min show were their previous shows were less than 5 min episodes."

Hell looking like a corporate world was a hilarious touch and loved how Akane came to get Seiji by imagining him with a happy family. \n\nknowing its an ongoing manga made me skeptical at first but i'm pretty sure this is going to take my AOTS simply for how much i looked forward to an episode every week, asking for a season 2 and some nendoroids isnt too much right ;)\n\n ^Akane ^^best ^^Girl ^^^Figure ^^^pls."

I also don't really like how they made her 'part of the gang' even though she was an antagonizing bitch 5 minutes beforehand, but I'll overlook it.\n\n**Final Verdict**\n\nOverall, this was a pretty enjoyable show to watch. Most of the cast was charming and had fun interactions with each other, and the comedy overall was enjoyable but not especially hilarious. The Drama was fine at times, but lacking at others. The overarching storyline and ending were unnoteworthy, but okay. Overall this show was about average. Its comedy was fun but nothing special, and its drama was a bit lacking but nothing offensive. Yuzu is best girl, and Yuzu x Seiji is best ship. Not much else to say about the show other than that I enjoyed it, and ended up giving it a mid to low **6/10**."

   "text": "So Shikimi-san was a literal attention whore throughout her life? Wow. What's not so wow is the reveal that Guri was part-demon. Don't think you can come up with a more obvious twist from this season. All in all a great ending to the funniest show this season IMO.\n\nTV Tropes describes this show as a \"Love it or Hate it\" sort of deal, and I'm definitely in the former category. From wonderfully vibrant art/animation, a splendid cast of characters, and great humor in general. The elephant in the room has to be addressed though: the series' series moments. Actually not too bad. I mean, when each character that gets a backstory ends up being relevant throughout, what is there to complain? Still, I really don't get this trend of extremely silly shows turning serious all of a sudden. Nanbaka, Busou Shoujo, and now this. I really just want a purely silly show like KonoSuba, okay? Either way, I'm actually rather satisfied with what I got from this show. Now to go on to repeating the OP on loop. Shit that stuff's addicting."
