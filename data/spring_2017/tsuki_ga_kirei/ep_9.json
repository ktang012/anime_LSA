Just rain, breaths, and footsteps. The last speakers we hear before the silence is Akane's friends and the next voices we here are Chinatsu and friend. \n\nThere is a small expository monologue from Akane after the silence is broken, but if this were another show, those 2 minutes would have been filed with suspenseful or sorrowful music and a ton of monologue all meant to force a mood or keep the idiot viewer informed.

   "text": "Akane getting jealous was an unexpected turn.  I thought it really put a different spin on her character--to this point, she hadn't seemed interested in him *that way* beyond being a little curious.\n\nI think the conversation Kotarou had with Chinatsu really shook Akane.  To that point, he'd almost always been awkward around Akane. The only time he seemed relaxed was at the shrine, when they were talking about his practice for the festival and her track meet.  Outside of that, there's always been this awkward air between them.  By comparison, Kotarou was very relaxed talking with Chinatsu.  It was more than him just talking to another girl.  It was a side of him that she didn't get to see as much, an openness that is what she's curious about and isn't getting.  That, to me, is what makes this jealousy angle good.  It's not just jealousy; it's frustration.\n\nThese kids don't know how to act around each other, and for Akane, that got super frustrating. Are they friends? Are they dating? Should she expect him to be 100% punctual to a date? Was it even a date?  This uncertainty of expectations makes her frustrated, and she takes it out on him--more so than he deserves.  Just knowing that his phone was confiscated would be enough to make most people let it go, but her frustration isn't done yet.\n\nIn the end, Akane said it best: she wants to talk to him more. It's one of the most amazing expressions of self-insight I've ever seen, both for its simplicity and accuracy.  Her coming to the shrine when her phone died was a good indicator, but how sour she got when she couldn't see him, when other people could draw a smile and laughter from him, really cemented that she finds something attractive or interesting about him--something I hadn't felt so strongly before."

Like [bkim3695](https://www.reddit.com/user/bkim3695) said, they need to speak up, and stop reliying on their friends to fill in the blanks.\n\nI wasn't a fan of Akane chewing so hard on Kouta for trying to reach her using Chinatsu's phone. I get it it's all about inducing some jealousy on Akane so she can appreciate him on the long run, but to me it felt a tad excessive.\n\nNot a big fan that they are so dependant on an app to comunicate with each other. I hope after finally becoming a formal couple they look out for each other in person and not just by chatting.\n\nSpeaking of phones. This is the very first time I've seen students get their phones confiscated on a school trip. I mean, what will they do if one of them gets lost in a city they are unfamiliar? Or if they need to call for help if someone else gets injured?\n\nNow moving on to the positives of the show. It was nice to see all the Koutaro's suffering payed off. I particularly liked the metaphor of the calm after the storm and the sun shinning again after he got a Yes.\n\nI like that sensei still has Roman running circles inside her head, lets hope they get closer in future extras. Also liked the Setsuko & Nagahara extra, i always dig a female character that can value herself. Geez, Nagahara comes off like Takuya the sex creep from Scum's Wish, at least buy her dinner or take her to some interesting places, use your head on top of your shoulders not the one between your legs.\n"

Perhaps she knew that Kotarou wouldn't leave her hanging like that.\n\nOther than this, I think this episode really reassured me that Tsuki ga Kirei isn't just another Slice of Life. It's a stage to show the innocence of adolescence and the beauty of awkwardness. \n\nAnd the best part is how it doesn't force it down your throat all at once. The pace may seem erratic, with how quickly they confessed to each other, while still being hot and cold about it; but that unevenness is honestly very natural with teenagers. It reminds me of the time when I had crushes, doubts and aspirations all at the same time. \n\nThis anime comes as an unexpected contender for my AOTS, but I'm not complaining. :)"

   "text": "Rarely do you find a show that portrays life as good as Tsuki ga Kirei does it. If the Tatami Galaxy is the perfect portrayal of the struggles of a college student, then this show is a near-perfect portrayal of young adult life. It captures the anxiety and behavior of its age group near perfectly and really feels like a trip through memory lane as it evokes a very nostalgic feeling. There's no unnecessary drama but rather trades it in for a very heartening and endearing experience that becomes better with every episode as you get more and more invested in the characters. This show is a perfect romance experience, but on top of that a fantastic and very genuine protrayal of Young Adult life. What a great show."

   "text": "I think they hit the nail on the head with Azumi being relatively direct with his feelings and Akane being uncertain and needing time to process things. I can easily see that happening irl as unfortunate and annoying as it is.  I'm really hoping that Akane doesn't let these misunderstandings stand in the way of what clearly has potential to develop into a special relationship. I was practically yelling at my tv when she seemed to hold those accidental slights against him. I'm also glad Azumi is also taking the advice from that book and making conscious decisions to get what he wants. "

Like their awkwardness speaks to some part of my childhood, while their success just makes me even more depressed about my own childhood.  Like for every long pause, I think, \"she should get bored of you, she's going to walk off.\"  Every fumbled meeting, I'm like \"how is she putting up with you?\"  \n\nI can't help but wonder what she sees in him, because I see way to much of myself in him.  And \"myself\" is not a very likable or attractive person.  It's weird to feel like you really relate to a character but kind of don't want to see them succeed.  It feels wrong.  Wish fulfillment for my fifteen year-old self."

I don't really care if it's cliche or not, but it's just inherently frustrating as hell to watch. \n\nAlso, I just remembered feelsbadman moments where a similar thing where I ask to meet somewhere to hang and do stuff but end up losing contact (because phone died, etc.). It wasn't after a confession or anything but I somewhat expected her to be there (since we spent some time figuring out details) but instead after waiting for about 30-40 minutes, no one came. I turn my phone back on later to find that she never came in the first place because she decided to bail (sometimes for good reason, others not really). Happened quite a number of times, not just with girls i had interest in, but also friends and people I wanted to get to know. "
