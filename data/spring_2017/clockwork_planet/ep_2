   "text": "Okay, LN reader here. Since the anime wasn't very clear about it I should probably try to explain Marie and Naoto's conversation.\n\n\nFirst thing is Marie saying that if Naoto can identify one \"bad\" gear from millions of them, then it's not just super-hearing. He must already subconsciously know what a \"good\" set of millions of gear should sound like, therefore know what was wrong with it when one of them clash with his expectation.\n\n\nTherefore she concluded that if modern clocksmith science cannot fix RyuZu and Naoto can, then modern clocksmith science is all wrong and Naoto is right. That's why he's never good in school. He subconsciously know that textbooks are wrong, yet he's convinced they're right.\n\n\nNaoto then told Marie that she, too, should have the same kind of \"knowing\" what things are supposed to be, when she can create new technologies out of thin air like when she create interface to join Vermouth's head to sexbot body and Halter's to killbot body. Marie concluded that it's the same kind of ability that goes in opposite direction to Naoto's.\n\n\nAfter that, she told Naoto to give her his \"knowledge\" on the Pillar of Heaven to her directly by saying it out loud. Don't try to \"explain\" it, just say what he felt and she'll process it herself. What Naoto said in the anime is just what Naoto said to prep Marie's mind to his train of thought, then it was followed by 2-3 pages of technobabbles that doesn't supposed to make sense capping with the last sentence in anime about how Clockwork Planet shouldn't be still running right.\n\n\ntl;dr: Read the novels, folks. It's great. :3"
