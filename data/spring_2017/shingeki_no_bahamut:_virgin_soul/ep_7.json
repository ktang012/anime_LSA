But then they were basically attacking everyone so... I also find it interesting that that wasn't anyone's priority throughout the episode, you know, to get civilians to safety. The king is a jerk but c'mon,. Also wonder what Kaisar is going to do... And Nina and Mugaro too. Mugaro will probably go to Azazel's aid and Nina will be looking for him and suddenly come face to face with the king.\n  \nRocky shocked at Rita reminiscing about the good old days was funny too. Mugaro probably thinking \"wtf dad\" when he walked on Azazel and Nina. Also I love Mugaro, he's so adorable. Probably thought so himself when Azazel saw his clothes."

The Lady demon's death was especially sad cause you could tell she idolized and trusted Azazel the most. He probably didn't tell Nina about the plan cause he knew she wouldn't want to take part in it - which was pretty manipulative, but you gotta be ready to get your hands dirty like that in war. I was frustrated with Nina too for not even showing up at the meeting place, but to be fair, she thought today was just going to be a fun day at the parade and didn't want to deal with Azazel's bossiness. \n\nWe're gonna see a big battle next week, though I was hoping to see it today, and I'm betting Charioce will pull through even when Mugaro and Nina show up. Sofiel might even get her hands on Mugaro since we know she's probably near by when he uses his power, unless Bachus comes in to save the day. "

Now I know how Nina feels ,man the girl must be suffering on the inside with love.\nAlso her rejecting Azazel was hilarious but it had some serious implications for the demons. I think he shouldnt have relied on Nina to go dragon mode and it was the worst timeing.\n\nI feel happy for Nina being in love and it was dramatic irony that she said she didn't care to see the king in the parade.lol.\n\nYou know what like or hate Charoice but at least he puts himself on the front lines rather than hiding behind closed doors or expecting to be worshipped like his father. Charoice reminds me alot of conquer and uniter Kings like Charlemagne , and Gangus Khan or Alexander the great. They weren't the nicest people but they had amazing admenstrative power and leadership. I also like a king who can carry himself well and has a large amount of dignity rather than being chivilous. He reminds me a little of Gilgamesh from fate zero.\n"

This gives us a hard curve ball right in to the chest. I like to believe that the  writers and animators arnt going to go through with this whole forbidden romance wasting tons of money and man power just to be washed away in a few episodes. I really hope it continues and becomes a more of a proment thing.\n\nPeople want to easy way of love and I don't think this is the right show for them if they want that. There are hundreds of other anime or light novels for that. The writers are oviously trying to trick us on some of these characters especially Charoice's character. Pay attention to his eyes that anime loves to focus on. They betray what he is feeling very suttlely. The writers are smart having the story and the characters say bad stuff about him. But if you pay attention to him the animators portray him in a different\u200b light.\nIf you hate his character I like to think that it would just ruines the show considering that he is the person who puts the whole evens in the second season into action.\n"

I do not know how the Humans threat the Angel survivors. But if the Angels do not want use force, then they should show something like UNO Power (We do not Shoot first!). Also the Angels should punish the Dark Human hearts, in doing so in revealing their Sins to Humanity (Slavery, Sexual Abuse and worse). Angels punish only the Sinners, Demons kill even innocents\n\nDragon ?? Nina only see both sides want to abuse her, and so she take Mugaro under her Wing and travel with these 2 fallen Gods in this Carriage. Until Mugaro choose her own Destiny (or understand it).. Perhaps Mugaro reunited with her Mother and then let her choose.. (What had the King done with her Mother and so on. Perhaps that even affect Nina's battle Moral)\n\nAnd perhaps in the end, Arc Dragon Bahamut appear to give Nina's fighting the extra \"I support her!\" touch. But then we are back to square one. Humans, Angels and Demos fear of Bahamut and the fear can give birth to Nina's downfall. The circle of hatred close again\n\n\n"

She is well aware of the localized abuse of demons, but I don't think she understands the systemic abuse, or how different things were. She is sixteen, and probably isn't mature enough to interpret events and situations that don't directly affect her personally.  \n\n> She turned a blind eye so she could have fun. Azeal should have informed her about the plan at least the parts to get her on his side but he shouldn't have to do to much cause of what she has seen.\n\nAzeal told her \"Meet me at this spot at 12\". That's it. No mentions of an ambush or avenging demons. So she didn't turn a blind eye to anything. Azeal, out of fear that Nina would run away from him because she does not want to turn into a dragon or endure Azeal's advances, kept her in the dark. He's an idiot for thinking that Nina can simply be ordered around, and putting all of his eggs into one basket. Also, he had no contingency plan for if the Red Dragon transformation doesn't work. Terrible military planning.\n\n> How you been alive this long and still can't control your powers.\n\nI mean she still 16. You won't be a master of anything at that age. As for Favaro, I'm still waiting for him too, and one of the main reasons why I\"m watching this show. We don't know the nature of the training, but I like how the show casually mentions that. It hinted that Nina can be around a handsome guy without turning into a dragon if she's comfortable with the said guy. "
