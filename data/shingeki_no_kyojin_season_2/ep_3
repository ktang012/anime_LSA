There are no prompts or auto aim, so everything you do is completely manual and relies on you learning the timing and speed to move your mouse in coordination with the keys for the grappling hooks. The titans in the game are far easier than the ones from the show, aside from the abnormals which are scarily fast. Taking down one of them is actually an impressive feat of computer gaming skill. Coming in from behind to kill a titan that's about to eat another player, pulling off a Levi-esque killing side swipe, or standing on rooftops as they're converging on you, or swinging away from one that's full on sprinting you is pretty damn thrilling\n\nIf anyone considers playing it, and I'd encourage it if you'd like a simple AOT game, in the settings set shift lock to on. That way the camera moves with the mouse. It's almost impossible to play otherwise. "

   "text": "That looked like a different place but then again it was 60 years ago. I'm not really sure on that because they were definitely in a walled city but they said her home was outside the wall so maybe there are actually multiple walled cities.\n\nhttps://puu.sh/w9PtQ/8fa94cecea.jpg They were injected with I'm guessing the titan serum before they were thrown off the wall.  The cult seemed like it didn't really do anything. Probably just something created by someone to make money.\n\nI wonder, if it really was a different city then maybe that means there are a bunch of human cities and they all have different beliefs about titans and what to do with them. If titans really only come from people being injected with a serum then maybe that means that before the cities were created/walled the titans were used for war. If so then maybe they got out of hand and that's what lead to humanity being nearly wiped out and forced behind the walls. It would be kind of like a nuclear war that forces the survivors to live in bunkers forever. \n\nThen from that each surviving city had a different philosophy with how to move forward. The one we start out in decided it was best to hide the truth and let everyone forget. They forbid anyone from that time from ever speaking about it and destroyed any record of what happened and just left the one family/group in charge of remembering and protecting the secret. Maybe that family is descended from the king that Ymir was pretending to be descended from in her flashback. Maybe that king is the one responsible for the existence of the titans.\n\nActually, maybe it wasn't a war that the titans were created for. Maybe that king wanted immortality and the titan serum was the result of that search. Maybe they thought it was complete and he and a bunch of nobles and other people that could afford it and wanted it took it. There would likely be other people in his family, advisers, etc. that would think it's a bad idea and not take it which would explain there being descendants around who aren't titans. Them being a higher class would also explain why they wouldn't know about the titan issue quickly since they wouldn't do much that would injure them.\n\nMaybe the city we start in is one that was created by people who were still loyal to the king after the disaster and that's why they hid the truth and why Christa's family is so high. Then Ymir's city is one created by people who hated the king for it so they didn't need to hide the truth. Ymir likely wouldn't have known though because she was homeless already while so young and then taken into a cult of the king. The other people in the cult were maybe fooled into believing the government was lying about the immortality. That would fit in with them being told to just worship Ymir and they would be immortal. Everyone else believed the government and that's why there was so much hate for them when they were walked through the streets. Then being turned into a titan and thrown off the wall was their punishment because it's what they wanted even though not exactly. Kind of a \"we already told you this was the truth but since you don't believe us gtfo and enjoy before you screw us all again\" thing.\n\nThis doesn't cover whatever conflict Reiner mentioned this episode, though. Unless there's a village of titans outside the walled cities looking for revenge. "

If they weren't the military in her \"hometown\", they'd at least have to be police or some kind of government enforcer.\n\nAlso, I'm pretty sure Ymir and her \"followers\" were killed like that for some special reason, pretty sure injecting someone with Titan serum or whatever before pushing them off is a lot more costly than just pushing them off or hanging them or whatnot. There's no way that making people into Titans is just some normal execution."

My guess would be that there are multiple cities with humans behind walls and they were basically in war with each other. Some dude created the titan serum and then they used titans without will as guard dogs. Due to some ciircumstance its sometimes possible for someone to turn back into a human. This is a far better result than guard dogs without will since you get actual warriors(rainer and group), so whoever created the serum worked on it and perfected it(this is where erens dad somehow comes into play aswell. He probably tried to copy the serum). This happened during the 70 years or what it was that ymir ran around.\n\nAs for the motivation why reiner and group try to break the walls now and are interested in annie, i would assume that their hometown has the serum to create titan warriors and wild titans, but not to create titans that can form a wall, where as the church within wall maria is the opposite situation. Since the humans within wall maria etc cant create titans themselves they needed other ways to fight titans which resulted in 3dm gear. \n\nThe ape titan from outside probably didnt need a way for normal humans to kill titans earlier, but believes it to be useful knowledge. Now the question is why is that useful knowledge for someone who can order wild titans he created around."

There are other characters that remember it as well.

It would make it quite clear, since manga reader know the full flashback, but the connection isn't fully revealed at this point, and most people probably wouldn't recognize Marco VA\")\n\nIt is like when people point out an opening is filled with spoilers, if you didn't know that beforehand then you would look at the OP and go \"wow great visual\", now you just go, oh so all of this will translate to that, and that quite clearly reveal what that person secret power is.\n\n\nTL;DR if it was only Anime Viewer in this thread pointing stuff out, then it would be fine, but the problem is when manga reader know the importance of different thing, and use that to point out this meaningless looking shot is actually insanely important."

They ruled over the humans but eventually the humans rebelled and started a war. The founding titan used his ability called coordinate to force his will upon all the Eldians he could and had them escape to the island called paradise where he then ordered thousands of colossal titans to use their hardening ability to create the walls.

The country of Marley controls all of the shifter titans and selects Eldian kids from a young age to go through training and brainwashing allowing them to leave the ghettos and slums to fight for them as the shifting titans. If the kids refuse they turn their entire families into mindless titans and release them onto the island like Ymir was shown in this episode, or they use them as fodder in wars against other human countries. Eventually Erin's dad has a son who is selected to become a shifter titan. He tries to get his son to join a sort of Eldian rebellion as a shifter, but his son eventually turns him in.

   "text": "Fuck if I know but its seems from reading everyone's theories/speculation thus far from all the episodes as of S2E10, we can assume the following: \n\n1)\t(*ONE WAY*) **A FOR SURE** way for a normal human to become a Titan is by being injected with [a syringe containing a special biological-enhancing serum that immediately alters their genetic makeup and can be thought/seen as the scientific method by which humans can turn into titans] (http://i.imgur.com/QZrkZqY.png) AND when certain (additional?) requirements are fulfilled (see points below) can also grant the individual injected with this \u201cgenetic altering serum\u201d (basically their worlds \u201cgene-drive\u201d look this up it\u2019s cray-cray IRL)  the **POTENTIAL** to become a \u201cShifter\u201d (for a lack of a better name). This information (from what manga readers are saying) was given too early in the Anime as compared to the late on in the Manga. Which I find interesting that they went this manner from a director\u2019s perspective but it is essentially part of Ymir\u2019s backstory so I guess I understand?\n\n2)\tCannibalism\u2026 to be blunt, is a requirement to become a shifter it seems.  As it was revealed today, Ymir, after 60 shitty years of being a \u2018mindless\u2019 wandering Titan from being stabbed and exiled/punished as a Titan,**ate Marcel**, Bert & Reiner\u2019s friend. (Who is most likely a shifter since Bert/Ymir spoke about them regaining their human forms AND gain the ability to transform it was NECCESARY to eat someone special, again speculation points to \u201cShifters\u201d). This would mean you almost \u201cinherit\u201d Titan shifting powers from someone who already possessed Titan powers. Meaning there has to be an origin.  ED 3 gives clues to this.                                                                                                                                      Additionally. 3 of the 4 people present when Ymir awoke from her slumber were/are confirmed to be Titans, Annie, Bert, and Reiner, so it\u2019s likely that Marcel the only unconfirmed shifter at this point was likely one as well, based on how Reiner/Bert only hang out with \u201cwarriors\u201d? Whatever that means.                                                                                                                               Also, to help my point, from the [Ending (ED3 Scenes) it can be seen that the original King (Or original nobles) performed cannibalism, along with what looks like other children/adults in hopes of gaining Titan powers]( http://imgur.com/a/jx5Mj#UkHPaUb), for whatever reason? Maybe power, maybe wanting control, still blurry. \nSpeaking of nobility, Christa (and likely other nobles) are descendants of the Original Titan(s)? There has to be a root. A genetic root we can follow that leads to the origins of how/why humans sought or gained the ability to turn into Titans. Reiner mentions how important Christa is to the mission (whatever that means?), also if history has taught anyone anything is that Nobility means power and power means control. So whatever Nobles/Kings/Queens exist in the world of AoT, they must have some strong connection to the Titans and most importantly their origins. A lot of clues point to this but too long for this post I think. \n\n3)\tThere exist (possibly not any more) a military in this world. From the cult raid, they were clearly exiled/punished by some form of military in 'some other town' OUTSIDE the town/walls the story originates from. Someone else in this (or the Anime-only subreddit) pointed out a strong possible theory that Titans were used as a war weapon. Which thinking about it, is a possibility. The fact that the government/military can just inject them with syringes containing the \u201cgenetic altering serum\u201d and throw them off a wall, likely land, excrete blood and immediately turn right after means that this is \u201cjust accepted/common knowledge?\u201d [Someone also came up this this theory which I find very intriguing:] (https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6f1gld/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_season_2_episode_35/diey9b0/)\n\n4)\tOVA 1 was references and essentially can be explained now. (https://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/6f16t8/anime_spoilers_attack_on_titan_s2e10_children/dieptbk/) Also I just remembered\u2026 that that \u201cfollower\u201d titan\u2026 he KNEALS BEFORE the OVA girl/protagonist, in similar fashion to what he did when he was in the cult. Talk about foreshadowing JESUS CHRIST!!!  \n\n5)\tThe basement and Eren\u2019s father. Very few people know about the basement. However, in there lies answers to some of the theories/question but will only raise so much more. A lot of people speculate that Eren\u2019s father was eaten by Eren, to fulfill the requirements to become a Titan. Considering he \u201cdisappeared\u201d one day that is not far from impossible. Also, who knows what really lies within it but it\u2019s definitely Titan related. \n\n6)\tI feel like there is so much foreshadowing so much I missed from S1 and the previous eps of S2, I feel like I will rewatch it all again after this season ends going scene by scene. Analyzing as much as possible. \n\n7)\tLast minute speculation I found that were very interesting: \n\ni.\thttps://www.reddit.com/r/ShingekiNoKyojin/comments/6f16t8/anime_spoilers_attack_on_titan_s2e10_children/diey7gh/\n\n8)\tLastly, although Titans are fun and all and humans killing humans has been a great past time for the world, but the biggest question personally is, \u201cWho is the enemy?\u201d Who is truly the one(s) that need to be stopped. Someone is running the show. Yet, the star actors are in their place, the audience is roaring with thunderous applause, and the play is about to reach its climax. \n"

The titan would keep eating other humans, thus human bodies would come raining down on the already eaten human, potentially injuring them. If injured then his chance of surviving would get even lower due to the panic the injury caused him and the injury potentially hindering him from avoiding the next batch of dead bodies which could injure him even further. I doubt anyone who knows that he was inside the stomach of a titan and is injured would be able to stay calm.\n\n2. The inside of a titan's stomach is not an empty bag. It has a liquid there. I'm not sure whether it has an acidic properties or not, but if it is then the eaten human would have his body melt due to the acid. If it is not, then being in the liquid itself would hinder his movement, which would disable him from avoiding dead bodies raining down on him as the titan eat more humans.\n\n3. It was shown that after eating humans, titan would vomit them back since they lack digestive organs. The vomit was a crystal with the dead bodies inside. Assuming that somehow he was able to avoid getting injured while inside, he won't survived being crystallized since it means that he won't be able to breathe.\n\nThese are not my thoughts just something I found."

   "text": "**Anime only speculation** here, but after noticing that in the first season with the Walnut wall how everyone ^(Historia too? Probably, idk) on one side of the wall turned out to be titans.. I started really trying to read into the ending credits this time. **Ninja Edit: [Walnut Wall Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFdzNhJAdco) & [Season 2 End Credits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbfHY8mkhT8)\n\nSo.. this is what I've gathered.. At some point, a woman makes a deal with a demon/devil and gains the power to become a titan.\n\nShe goes on a rampage and kills the shit out of an army.\n\nThen somewhere else entirely, ^(coupled with our new info of the Blood of the King stuff from this episode) that king has some kids gain his blood. Maybe that's from eating his heart, ^(kind of explains the glowing hearts in the opening too) or being biological.. idk, but he's got a bloodstain over his heart. \n\nSo.. I'm thinking that this King has his own way of being a Titan, and kinda took a monarchical approach to it, like only my family will have this awesome power.\n\nAt this point a whole bunch of titans just show up being attacked, so maybe the girl from the beginning started sharing that power with everyone and they all became titans. But since they haven't eaten any hearts yet, they're mindless titans.\n\nThey get in and go on a rampage, and they all get to munch on the people who lived under that king, becoming human again. The people get exiled from that castle town and wander off into the distance. ^(I'm guessing this was the last bit of humanity who created the walls?)\n\nThe new humans in the castle start worshipping the original titan girl as a goddess. Then for the sake of explaining the conflict, they have the image of the Goddess crossed out. ^(Probably by some of the survivors of that purge.)\n\nThis leaves us with factions- The people who worship the goddess, the people who worship the king and humanity.\n\nAgain, I've never read the manga, and if you have please.. please don't spoil it for me, but this is what I'd come up with after watching the credits and trying to connect it with what we learned this time. Thoughts? Complaints? Rebuttals? Come on, fire away- I'm ready to talk theories with other anime-only's."

It seems thats also where the Titans are from/being experimented one.\n\nThey were also injecting them with needles before tossing them off.\n\nSo if you put 2 and 2 together I think Erins dad is from that place/head scientist or some shit and the basement is a lab with the formula/secrets to titan shifting. When he left when he was a kid he probably returned back to this kingdom (In Ymirs flashback they mentioned having the blood of the king so it must be a kingdom/former kingdom of some sort.) \n\nQuestion is have all Titans been human creations, or did humans learn their secrets? If im going off the cryptic outro it seems some lady made a deal with the devil and got titan powers. There is also a king in the outro making his(?) kids eating flesh of somebody (maybe that lady) Following this logic, maybe that gives them powers too which is why the blood of the king is a big deal, but I assume this all happened a long time ago so it became a legend or something.\n\n\nThats my take on things at least, some I'm positive of, some are just guesses.

I know she talks about how she's such a bad person but I just can't believe she would subject Historia to that type of pain and torture. I know she isn't exactly safe staying inside the walls and fighting Titans but still.\n\n2. It's kinda weird how she talked about her resolve to be true to herself and not live a lie anymore and wants Historia to do the same, but still calls Historia by her fake and made up name Christa. This is something that doesn't bother me I just thought it was interesting. I'm gonna chalk this up to habit since she's called her that for a while now.\n\nBonus - HAHAHA Eren you're killing me over here.\n"

This is a pretty big deal because this knowledge greatly affects one's perception of the story, which is a pretty big deal IMO for a story that contains a lot of mystery elements. If you follow the manga, you know that the next arc in the series is pretty lengthy and puts the outside world on the backburner to focus on Eldia's internal politics. What that means is that revealing the outside world at this point in time provides nothing for the story and instead will make the next arc seem like some sort of filler.

I think Erens dad was also a shifter and he let eren eat him to gain control of it which is why his dad is gone. I think there is two civilizations. One which knows about Titan shifting and all that which is Ymirs plus only the military knows about it and one that keeps it hidden within the church and royal Family but does not have synriges at their disposal. The one that knows about it uses Titans as a military force and Reiner and Bert are part of it. The people that are part of this civilization probably are deceived by the military in this process: The people are told that Titan shifters are like witches and normal people don't have the means to transform which creates hate from the civilians. Which is probably what the cult was trying to do. The leaders of the cult probably tricked them into thinking the King is a Titan shifter who can grant Titan shifting which basically means immortality (Because I think Titans are immortal from what Ymir said). But in reality the cult leaders didn't know how to transform only the military does but the cult tricked everyone for money and abandoned it once it got out of hand and the military charged in (Basically either the king thing is a lie or they were kinda close but wrong) . Once the military is on top of the walls where no one can see they throw off everyone while turning them into Titans- (one) for punishment (two) to keep them from finding out because the military was probably scared the cult might find out the way so they desperately tried to shut them up by turning them into a mindless Titan with no Titan shifters to eat. Ymir by random chance probably ate their Titan shifting friend (Bert and reinstall) causing her to transform back into a human shifter. I also think the beast Titan has a synrige as well and that he is running around turning everyone into mindless Titans knowing they can't transform eating regular humans but only shifters. Also since we pretty much know the beast Titan is a shifter we can assume from when he said \"You know we reside in the nape\" that he pretty much clarified everyone is a human in the Titans nape. I also think the church are descendants from ymirs civilization that have other means to use Titans but don't believe in using Titans for anything but the walls. I also think Erens dad is from the same civilization as Ymir with expertise in their knowledge who switched sides. Which explains why he has a synrige. I'll continue Later. Please manga readers confirm if this is true so far or at least close. Thanks"

[In the clip where Erin remembers his dad with the syringe, his dad tells him to recapture Wall Maria.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q9Ay1yunM0w) If he was a titan shifter, why would he endanger his son? Why not do it himself? Granted, Erin eating him would explain his dad's disappearance, but I just don't understand why he would sacrifice himself when he could have done the task. I don't know what shifter Erin could have eaten, but I don't think it was his dad. \n\n\n> I think there is two civilizations.

If they were completely off base, they could have just been imprisoned or whatever. Throwing them over the wall and turning them into titans seems pretty extreme, so they must have been a potential threat. \n\n\n\n> I also think the beast Titan has a synrige as well and that he is running around turning everyone into mindless Titans knowing they can't transform eating regular humans but only shifters.\n\n\n\nI agree, he is most likely behind the village incident, but I'm wondering if there are other means of converting humans to titans. It's implied most if not all of the villagers were converted, so he would need quite a lot of syringes. Also, from the flashback, it looked like they were turned into titans relatively quickly after being injected. Point being, you would have to inject multiple people rapidly, or else you would be close to an angry titan who is looking for titan shifters. Whatever the method, it would have to be nearly simultaneous conversion, because they made a big point about how there was no blood in the village. The first converted titans would likely start trying to eat the other villagers if it didn't happen all at once, and there would have been bodies.\n\n\n> I also think the church are descendants from ymirs civilization that have other means to use Titans but don't believe in using Titans for anything but the walls. \n\n\nThey don't necessarily have to be descendants, perhaps they paid for the secret or committed espionage. But it seems likely that they have less capability than the other civilization. Whatever it was, the church guy was pretty committed to not giving up the secret to Levi. "

Christa is still a crappy character and I hope she gets killed off at some point.\n\nI like Reiner and Berthold. They're much more interesting than Eren, Armin and Mikasa. They're likeable despite being insane mass murderers and Reiner being a crazyman. I \nkind of put that aside because I'm holding out that there must be SOME justification for what they're doing, because overall they don't seem like horrible people. \n\nAlso, they showed Christa as part of the Cadets. Did we see that? I can't remember her even being in S1, Was she part of a different cadet or am I just remembering wrong? I mean she's a bland forgettable nothing character so it's no surprise I'd forget her existing.\n\nAnother thing that bugged me later in the episode. Ymir is waiting around, then when Christa shows up (Oh god I'm talking about Christa agine) she quickly gets her in her mouth (clearly she didn't actually eat her but is just carrying her) and everyone assumes she just ate Christa. Are they all ******** or something? Why would she wait just for this nobody to show up just to eat her before running? Obviously she is trying to escape with her. That was some horrible writing... however perhaps they are just shocked and reacting without thinking. If in the next episode one of them is like \"wait a minute... maybe she didn't actually kill Christa!\" then this bit of anus writing can be forgiven.\n\nOverall I enjoyed this episode. That part with Ymir naked was not fanservice... was she supposed to wake up as a human wearing clothes? "

I've come to be interested in them because of the fleshing out they've been given by the narrative. I like how they've been doing things, it feels more realistic having more people getting involved and being important. The world would feel less plausible if significant actions were only done by or to Eren, Mikasa, Armin and the other mains. "
