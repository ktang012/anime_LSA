They're in the middle of a world ending crisis and Meteora is about to infodump (they think we are retards?), but let me interrupt all of you to explain that I met this girl once but then I stopped talking to her and now I feel super bad about it. He didn't even participate in the shitting on Setsuna, just felt kind of better about himself now that it seemed like she wasn't god's gift to fanart. It didn't even matter at this point since they already discovered who Altair was and came up with a plan to stop her independently. This was possibly the worst way this reveal could have come out, and it forced us through 11 episodes of this indecisive faggot wasting screentime on nothing. Why is he even relevant anymore?"

So why is it Altair gets all the powers from her derivatives while the other Creations don't? A hypothesis:\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor commercial creations, their best known form is, of course, their official work. Compared to the original, official, form, derivative fanwork versions are known by only a fraction as many people and accepted as \"true\" by even less. As a result, aphathy and rejection towards fanwork versions creates an \"official version\" inertia that cancels out acceptance of and prevents the Creations from getting any \"features\" from fanworks.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI am aware that there are cases where fanwork features get incorporated in the official version. That's more akin to an official revision than what's happened to Altair.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a non-commercial creation with only one \"official\" video, Altair doesn't have as strong an \"official version\" inertia pushing against derivatives getting incorporated into her form. Setsuna may even have helped the process along by putting a \"go ahead and make your own stories with her\" notice on the video.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a result, more people probably know of her from the derivatives than from her original video. Also, there are probably as many that accept the features of one version of her as there are of any other version of her. And there is practically no rejection of any version of her from all these people. Because of that, she can keep getting new abilities from new derivative works of her."

Im not really sure, but lets hope she doesnt just needlessly kill herself.  \n\nAfter the credits we get the MC of sword bitch's story.  This should be an interesting twist.

Someone pointed out that Altair was created as a big F you to everyone who thought Setsuna was plagiarizing people, so she's Setsuna's last original creation.\n\n> Also from side stories and secondary creations Altair has more powers....so are we just going to assume all these other characters have no side stories or people writing stuff about them. I had to miss something, because Altair shouldn't be the only one gaining side powers unless she is just unique.\n\nThere might be a theory to this:\n\nThe theory is that it might be because they probably don't know about their side stories. Altair may be constantly looking around to see what people come up for her, so that's why she's getting more powerful. The others may have the same abilities, but that would mean looking all over the net to see what people make up for them, but that also brings the fact that the side stories may not even give them new powers, just different stories. Another thing to note is that Setsuna never gave Altair any abilities, so everyone else is flling in the blanks for her. All of the other creations were equipped with their abilities that are now canon, so that may be another thing to keep in mind: Altair isn't exactly a official character, so she may not be bound to those kinds of rules. Basically, as long as Altair remains a fan character instead of an official character, she can keep adding on to her arsenal until they make her official.\n\n> No Magane sad episode\n\nPROFOUND.

I don't say that such behavior is good, but he didn't clearly know her circumstances, emotional state or that she could go for a suicide. Like nowadays, you can go join an online game and easily get flamed for being bad and said to go kill youself. But that doesn't mean you will really do that or take that seriously. Mostly because every person is different and reacts differently. Souta had his own emotions boiling and clouding his mind, and he just didn't take that message seriously.

Although something tells me that isn't going to be enough to beat her, and I wonder what will happen with Magane? Will they be able to include her in the story too? Can someone that knows about licenses shine a little light on this?\n\nIf they aren't able to include Magane on this crossover, then I can easily see her as the final \"boss\". I mean, Magane's power also, in theory, can increase exponentially without limits, and she doesn't need the help of the creators to do that.\n\nNow, this surely put things on perspective no? I mean, if the key to beat up an antagonist that is far to powerful for the heroes to handle is to create a franchise so they can level the power level of the antagonist and heroes into a possible fight that the heroes can win, I wonder what all of this says about all the \"Universes\" that Marvel, DC, and all the others are creating."

Suicide doesn't solve anything and it is always the worst possible option as it affects the people around you. \n\nSetsuna did the wrong thing and she didn't really try to solve the problem, she just chose the way out. And as common as it is, blaming oneself for not being able to save someone's life is irrational.\n\nI understand how his character is written, it is relatable, but it still triggers me as much as Alicetelia's self-righteousness."

He is only tangibly held to her death by string, but that is the same as giving someone information of an enemy but failing to give them the information that would allow them to survive or win.\n\nHe is largely not responsible, but there is the slight connection he has. If someone is being chased and you take them in to a building then abandon them to be chased again, you might be brought in for your part in their death. He is a character that can do nothing to protect anyone without placing himself into a situation that will end in his death but open the door to the building.\n\nUltimiately, the blame lies on Mamika for targeting Altair so quickly after learning the truth, but Sota and even Alice to a minuscule extent own some responsibility. Neither meant to push her to do waht she did, but she did it anyway."

Had he known that she was going to commit suicide and did nothing, then again, I'd agree. But simply not being friendly with someone doesn't make you responsible for their death. No court or law will hold you responsible if you are not directly complicit with a suicide.\n\nHis feeling of guilt is entirely on psychological/emotional level. And even if it is common and understandable it is by no means right. That, or you are okay with people wasting the rest of their lives on irrational feelings of guilt which can lead to an endless circle of sadness and more suicides (which also happen in the real life).

He has a such tiny amount of responsibility in both of their deaths that it is nothing that could amount to anything legally as you say yourself. His guilt shouldn't be something that drags him down whatsoever, but rather it should be a lesson to him. You need to take responsibility for your fuck ups and deal with them yourself, not allow your failures to superimpose themselves unto your life forever like Sota is doing.\n\nAs soon as he gets over his absolutely tiny part in the deaths then everything should be fine and he can carry on with what he does. He can get in no trouble and he should have explained all about Altair earlier. With luck he will continue to heal as he is starting to get past the point of feeling the guilt since he confessed, he now can help the group with as many worries.\n\nTL:DR: Sota needs to remember the part he had. No legal issues come into play or anything other than the emotional and personal effects he will feel. And Sota is healing so hopefully he won't fall into the cycle of sadness and suicides."
