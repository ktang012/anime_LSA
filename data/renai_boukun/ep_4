Did the jokes get too stale? Did the show get too serious? Is there a high percentage of drops? What is it? I'm loving this show, but genuinely curious on that front."

Then the second episode was probably the worst of the series (it was still good, but paled in comparison to the first.)\n\nI know I cooled on the series a little bit up until last episode, which I'd say was the best of the series so far.\n\nThe MAL score counts people who've watched 1/5th of the available episodes, I think, so it may also recover at the end of the run."

Guri is the best part of the show for me as her progression to learning what love is is really nice. \n\nBut Yuzu is like the definition of cliche tsundere and I feel her role in the series so far is so insignificant that the anime wouldn't change at all if she wasn't in it. There isn't realylanything unique about her whatsoever coupled with (And this is my opinion) her annoying voice and dumb pigtails just drives me mad.\n\nCan someone explain why they like Yuzu or what's so good about her to you? Is it just you have a weakness for Tsunderes, or something like that? Pliss help me understand."

They KNOW she's going to pull shit and not preemptively removing her is making their own personalities less realistic. I just feel the place would be better without her around."
