   "text": "Unlike any other gacha game, majority of your power comes from your effort on grinding. Even with mediocre luck on the gacha, as long you have good equipment (which you will have to grind), you can get to the top. There's some \"whale\" equipments as well but their advantage isn't outright broken and sometimes it's not even worth it.\n\nBut as most people have said, majority of us didn't start knowing about the grind. Most started because of probably artwork, probably music, or even probably just out of curiosity. The ones who stayed definitely should be able to attest this game is a grindfest. But that itself is personally fun IMO. I love progression and grinding it out gives me satisfaction.\n\nA few things I could point out why this mobile game is good (for me):\n\n* I can play it on PC (or browser (Chrome, Safari)). You can play it on your phone's browser too and don't have to download the app. It's fairly optimized for iPhone App; but for other devices, I recommend browser.\n* Progression system is very satisfying. Early on you'll be able to join Raids (hosted by other people) and you'll notice how weak you are. After much grind, it's pretty satisfying to see that you can eventually solo these Raids.\n* The raids play in real-time while being a turn based battle. It's very interesting concept and actually pretty fun. It makes playing with guildmates fun.\n* There's guild wars in it (nearly Monthly event). Probably one of the most serious part of the game (for those who like to compete). Albeit it's a PvE (against Monsters), you're competing against other guilds for gathering the most points (yet another 'grind'). \n* I can play nearly unlimited amount of time. While there's 'stamina' required to play the game, with enough effort you can play for nearly forever. My stamina consumption is way less than the small efforts I do to buy stamina refreshes. It makes me feel like I'm not playing a game with Stamina requirement at all.\n* The Artwork, Music, and Voice Actors are all great. The story picks up later on which the anime might not cover. Someone posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Granblue_en/comments/6hs16s/reason_to_play_granblue_it_has_all_of_my_favorite/) and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Granblue_en/comments/6hwnjk/reasons_to_love_granblue_pt2_sr_characters_need/) showing the hundreds of voice actors involved in this game. It has very extensive amount of characters. Although has little involvement, I'll also namedrop Nobuo Uematsu as involved in the Music and even if he didn't composed other music parts, you can tell he had influenced the music direction early on. My favorite boss battle themes [Yggdrasil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bxe-OSJ7ZU8) and [Leviathan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQ5TBh5Qkdk) just to give example. Oh and did I mention their art director previously collaborated on Final Fantasy V, VI, and IX, and Lost Odyssey?\n* The game is very forgiving for f2p players or casual spenders . Some f2p players I've known saved up draw for a 300-pull draw. Doing 300-pull draw at one banner (rate up period) allows you to pick your own SSR that's in the selection. If you're a casual spender, probably about every 1~2months, they have a Surprise Ticket Draw which will allow you to PICK your own SSR (out of nearly majority of the SSR characters, many of which can be 'core' characters).\n* Did I forget to mention I like the game?"

You get \"crystals\" from events, playing quests (story or side quests), special celebrations, etc. You also want to save all crystals for the end of every month when the double rate (for SSR stuff) event for gatcha aka legfest comes. TL;DR: don't use crystals on gatcha as soon as you get them. Try to hoard as much as possible even for month or two. \n\n-----\n\n> I don't want to pay real money lol\n\nI though the same at the begging ;p but fear not, Grandblue Fantasy is the most wallet friendly game when it comes to mobages. I played as pure f2p for like 4~5 months before I started using real money (to buy skins or buy additional gatcha rolls during legfest)"

It was kinda cool, I guess, but I would much rather have the characters actually introduced than just thrown around like that. Felt like I was being left out.\n\nVery clearly the ending though. Wonder what these next 2 episodes are even gonna be."

It's a world with many badasses and monsters are attacking a ***hub town***, it's not strange if some badasses come out and start defending the town ;) \n\nThink of it like Hunter x Hunter or One-Punch Man where there are many special individuals among the civilians.

That said, the plot for this first season was the part of the GBF storyline that just about everyone doesn't give a fuck because it's cliche as hell. After the Albion Arc (should have been eps 15+ +/-) is where the story starts to pick up in both pace and quality."
