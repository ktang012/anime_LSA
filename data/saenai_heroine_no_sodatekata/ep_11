By the way there's a cute scene after the credits!\n\n>Mr. Awfully Thick-Headed Deaf Protagonist\n\nMan this with Ero-Manga sensei are on top of burning their MCs good.\n\nAnyway it's the backstory episode with Utaha and Eriri and gotta say that it was kind of endearing. You got to see both creators get at each other and gain respect for their works. Especially in that last scene when both of them gave each other their autograph and have it in their room prominently.\n\nThat last scene before the credits is just as endearing since we can see most of the group barring Michiru getting filled with a sense of camaraderie. \n\nI'm really interested to see where this season goes! I personally expect to see some more best girl banters and some form of plot/romance development but since this is a harem romcom I don't expect much for romance but who knows it's a pipe dream. I hope LN readers can keep things to themselves for this one.\n\nAnd did Katou's ponytail grow out a lot more since last season? I don't entirely recall but it seems like it's a full-blown ponytail now which is [pretty nice I guess...](https://i.imgur.com/0g5XtrT.png).\n\n[It's aight](#flattered)"

I think he's just uncomfortable with how forward and physical she is, I doubt he's figured out why she is that way. His status as \"dense harem MC\" basically makes it physically incapable for him to recognize romantic feelings. I guess my point is that I don't think Saekano's characterization goes deep enough that the characters will have ulterior motivations that deviate too far from the character archetypes. I could be wrong, who knows. Either way the girls are much more entertaining. Still need Aki around, if only so Megumi will have someone to bounce off of. "
