Mainly that they've given the children these character traits seemingly for no reason other than to _not_ be their parents.\n\n* Given what we knew about Naruto and his character why would he ever be a deadbeat/absentee father? The \"explanation\" of him being busy makes no sense to me. The great ninja war was over, he wasn't even Hokage initially, Kakashi was. He had freakin' Shikamaru as his right hand man. Regardless, Boruto's way over the top daddy issues are grating to watch at best. Naruto's and Sasuke's character origins scaled well with who they were. Naruto's parents were dead, sacrificing themselves for him so he felt himself an outsider. Sasuke's entire clan was murdered in front of him. Boruto? Eh, his dad didn't go to all his baseball games, yet they write Boruto with this burning ire for his father as if he beats him and Hinata.\n* Why does Boruto lie about his eye in some scenes and not in others? Even in this episode there's a scene where he's talking to the group and directly mentions his eye then in the very next scene where the ghost appears and the group asks him if he sees anything he says no. For what reason?\n* This was also an issue in the original series-es but not nearly to the extent is in this one. Scene to scene the relative power of nearly every character is so insanely different it's frustrating. In the first episode you have Boruto and many of the other kids darting about super fast. I mean, one of the first scenes we see of Boruto in the series he jumps from a movie train onto a telephone poll drawn to be hundreds of yards away in an instant while holding a burger and soft drink. In this episode he's not fast enough to dodge nor is he strong enough withstand, evidently, ... paper.\n* The fucking eye. There's an entire episode dedicated to Boruto's eye and trying to reveal it as a byakugan. Not _once_ in that entire episode does any character go: Oh, you have a special eye? What is it like, what can you see, what does it do? Is it like your dad's eye that can sense evil intent? Nope, it's just \"Boruto says he has a special eye let's not listen to him at all and test him for the byakugan. Oh, he doesn't? Surprise, he must be lying.\"\n* The characters seem so much more shallow, possibly due to the fact that Boruto has introduced many more characters in a shorter time frame than the original series did. In Naruto by episode 11 you had less than 10 characters that had more than 2 lines: Naruto, Sasuke, Kakashi, Sakura, Iruka, Zabuza, and Haku. In Boruto you have basically the entire main cast of Naruto and Naruto Shippuden including their children every episode\n\nThe writing seems so much more juvenile, to me anyway. Best I can tell is that I've just outgrown the target audience."

But it isn't. Each possessed person is clearly acting on their own, but influenced by the ghost. They act differently from each other with different motivations, goals, and methods. \n\nIf I were to make it so different people fought you every week under my orders and influence, I'm clearly your big bad. I'm your villain. Your motivation is to stop me. But so long as I'm making you fight something different every one or two weeks, we have a monster of the week scenario. My Power Rangers example is pretty perfect here. The Big Bad of almost every season of Power Rangers makes the heroes fight something different all the time every week. Just like the ghost is. The solitary differences are the method of villain creation and the means of dispatching said villain. The concept of a big bad using people to screw with the heroes isn't new. And Boruto isn't a bad show for using the formula. But *it has been* using the formula. "

The episode with the super-star actor brings character interaction between Boruto and Sarada, and also sets up the stupid looking glasses joke between Boruto and Himawari. The episode a while back where Shino becomes \"the villain of the week\" sets up for this episode where Shino recalls the moment when Boruto saved him, and convinces Boruto's father (Naruto) to give Boruto more freedom in his decisions.

   "text": "> he looks similar to Guy in the Boruto movie, with small differences.\n\nFUCKING. KNEW. IT.\n\n>I don't think we have enough material to be sure what Metal Lee is like yet?\n\nYou just said Lee looks like Guy in Boruto. What exactly makes you believe \"Metal\" Lee isn't a rip-off of \"Rock\" Lee? I mean, even his name is a rip-off. It's just that old rock music vs. metal music because \"metal is harder than rock\" or something.\n\nThe lack of originality is producing the \"next generation\" is baffling. It's like they are doing it as some sort of joke."

Which is fine to think, but you're taking it way too far. Sorry we don't think in the same \"elitist\" mindset as you where the \"sequel is always a fucking joke grrrrrrr\" \n\nI also don't know why the new generation's personalities can't reflect the old ones. Do they have to be so far apart and original??? Cmon, they're the fucking kids of the old generation. It would be even weirder for them to NOT inherit their parents' mannerisms. Much less their fucking appearance.\n\n"

Even the title is a ctrl-c, ctrl-v of 4/6 of the letters na-ruto.\n\nDon't get what this show is doing, dude? Don't you get why I'm mad? This is milking the prequel in such an obscene way it's ridiculous. It copied its own character design. Everyone loved Lee, but, shit, he is all gone and old now. He can't be the kid ninja he was. IDEA: new rock lee! Only it's called metal lee and is 10/20 years younger.\n\nEverybody loved naruto and his iconic kage bunshin no jutsu, but he, too, is gone too old for a ninja school themed anime. So let's make his son a copy-pasta and give him that once forbidden jutsu just because.\n\nEverybody loved hinata. NEW HINATA. Shikamaru? New Shikamaru!\n\nBut, wait, shit! Sakura got together with Sasuke (AT FUCKING LEAST), if we copy-paste them like we did with Naruto-Hinata it's going to be weird, so... instead... FEMALE SASUKE. Perfect. Amazing. Good jab.\n\nSeriously, bro, this anime/subseries is a disgrace. It's putting way too little effort. It's jumping 100% on the fact that it already has fans that will swallow any garbage shoved down their throats. It's disgusting. People deserve better than this."

Just like rock music is derived from blues. Blues, in Japanese, is spelt as burusu, which is also how you spell the name Bruce. Rock Lee is called what he is because rock is derived from blues...and Bruce Lee."
