Still though, from Christa's perspective, it's not obvious/clearcut\n\nEdit  2: Actually I think what made it obvious is when Ymir said she would use Christa as insurance to live but was willing to risk her life to save her. Even Christa should've seen that part was a lie (not sure about the part after though). "

They repeat the same archetypes that have always existed in human history.\")\n\n[manga](/s \"And they think they're the first to make those choices, that they're the first to act on their petty, complicated dreams. Erwin wanted to find out why he was lied to - but then he comes to feel like the scouts' success is more important. Reiner wanted to help his mom - but he got swept up in the emotions and doubt that come with war. Eren wanted to kill all titans - now he's got different, more complex goals.\")\n\n[manga](/s \"They're all puppets of fate in Isayama's big show, slaves to the whims of the world.\")\n\n[manga](/s \"Bring in the Ackermans. They just *click* and decide what they want. And then they get it. They don't bother wasting time on reflection, on doubt. They accepted the world for what it is long ago, decided what they wanted from it, and *got to work*.\")\n\n[manga](/s \"And Levi is the biggest Mofo of them all. That's why Erwin decided to sacrifice all of the scouts to give Levi just one chance to fight the big bad. Because Levi is the only one *who could do it*.\")\n\nLevi sees the world for what it is, more than anyone else. A cruel place. An unknowable place. If Isayama had to pick a character he agrees with most, there's not a doubt in my mind on who he would pick: **Levi**."

They\u2019re such perfect foils for each other.\n\n- But Mikasa ain\u2019t here for your feels & good lord, she\u2019s a beast. I especially liked her speech to Kristoria: \u201c*there's only so many lives I actually care about. My enemies made deciding that easy 6 years ago. So you're mistaken to seek any compassion from me. Because right now, I'm all out of time & room in my heart to care*.\" I\u2019m pretty sure she would gut Kristoria on the spot if she had to. What a savage.\n\n- Seeing the 104th genuinely try to appeal to Bertholdt was kinda touching. And Reiner has to keep listening because one wrong move & Mikasa is killing someone not named Eren.\n\n- Even Bert gets his spotlight with a speech too, all but confirming that they\u2019re forced to do this. That \u201c*someone find us*\u201d was so heartbreaking, it almost calmed Mikasa down.\n\n- Erwin. What a man *swoons*. He made a huge gamble to bring those Titans & risk the lives of everyone but that\u2019s why he\u2019s the Commander. He has to make those kinda calls and not even a Titan chomping his arm can stop that.\n\n- Smart of Armin playing the Annie card right there & erase all that good from Bert. At least he created an opening for Erwin the gawd! And how\u2019s that for a cliffhanger. As if we could handle any more, Eren now has a fated reunion with the Titan that ate his mom.\n\nThis episode is the best of the season, surpassing even the reveal. Full of emotion, blistering pace and action. All those \"slow filler episodes\" made these moments hit harder."

It's crazy how no one calls out MHA for its overuse of flashbacks yet it's a problem here.\n\n>Can they really not find a more organic way to get that information across?\n\nWe literally had a whole episode of dialogue revealing key plot points yet people still complained so, no...there's no organic way that will please everyone. \n\n>the second season's pace just drags it out\n\nI'll give you that but there's a reason.

The original OP wanted a crazy battle and I pointed out that it happened. You then said that after that (the battle), they spoke for 10 mins which is clearly false.\n\n>Which again, doesn't excuse it from criticism especially when it's been dialed up to 10 for season two\n\nHey, you can repeat the same criticism every week if you want, be my guest. It's just silly to me because it's always been here and always will. More power to you."

That was happening while Annie was fighting Eren. In episode 6, Hange even told everyone not to mention anything about Annie around them. As far as they're concerned, she's back at the Military Police biding her time.\n\nSo when Armin says that, both Reiner & Bert not only realize they know about her but they've captured her as well and got info out of he through torture. Of course Armin is bullshitting because she's in the cocoon but Bert doesn't know that."

She also absolutely cares for Armin like he's family, which will be even more obvious later in an upcoming season. Also remember the civilians she helped save in season one's episode six. Sure, that's her duty as a soldier, but you could see her get absolutely *bloodthirsty* at the capitalist pig who was blocking the gate preventing the people from evacuating. She had a speech and everything, and in that speech she makes it clear that her anger is motivated by the fact that her comrades were dying out there while he was just fucking around with his cart, endangering all the civilians.\n\nI mean, even recently with the Bertholdt and Reiner reveal, even whilst strongly suspecting their double nature, she still hesitated when they revealed themselves. She didn't kill them, she went mainly for their arms, and later on she hated herself for hesitating. And in this episode she gives both Ymir and Historia ample time to step down. When Historia explains the situation to her, you can see for like a second how she has to force herself to not care about Ymir's predicament before regaining her composure, in order to save Eren. That's why she says that line you quoted, partly to convince Ymir that she's dangerous, sure, but mostly to convince herself that she cannot let her feelings get in the way of her ultimate goal this time.\n\nMikasa's heart is reserved for her family and she'll do anything to protect them. She still cares about others, but if they're standing in the way of her family she's not going to compromise. "

Right now with Kabaneri S2, Ancient Magus's Bride it's looking like Summer 2018 could be the arrival time (earliest would be Spring but I wouldn't bet on that).  Have to get the staff together and see how much longer the manga goes.\n\nThe bigger question will be: will the next few arcs get the 2-cour season that they deserve?  If so, S3 is gonna be BOMB.  If not, or it's 12 episodes we're gonna either see it rushed or question if we'll see S4 with the pacing.\n\nEither way, my hope is S3 gets confirmed RIGHT after the finale just so my heart won't be freaking out until October."

Seeing her being to overconfident in her ability and have her ribs get broken to end up being saved by a team mate so far below her skill is good for making her still feel human. Even after she manages to recover Eren thanks to the amazing plays by Erwin and Armin, You think everything is in the bag only for Reiner to peg her with a yet another titan. Its always good to ground your characters. No matter how skilled a person may be, They are still only human(Shifters excluded) and humans can be out done.\n\n\nAnd can we talk about Reiner here? This dude is swarmed by titans while still protecting his buddy and manages to toss other titans like  their footballs. The physical strength off his titan form is absurd. We saw it before when he sent Eren flying just by trading punches. I still feel so bad for these two. They know exactly what they did and have heavy regrets.

Just so we could learn something about the villains, like damn, I'll be super salty if this ends with both sides getting away and no one learning anything. The most that was revealed to the characters was Reiner & Bertholt being revealed, and then us viewers got backstory on Ymir and a glimpse of titan lore. But that's not really enough for a whole season, like please.\n\n\nArmin is the real MVP. Bruh dodged titans left and right, got on Reiner, and figured out how to make them squirm. Mikasa just got caught and didn't follow up on killing Ymir or Christa, so she was all talk this episode (seriously Christa is retarded defending Ymir, like this is seriously traitor shit). Erwin apparently can't see the titan right next to/in front of him. Armin was MVP for sure.\n\n\nI'm pretty sick of Christa's crap. Like there's an operation going on, and she's actively sabotaging it, despite the fact that Ymir is actively helping the enemies. \"But they'll kill her if she doesn't help!\" boi she could just jump off and escape right now, Reiner & Bertholt are surrounded and they're trying to escape, they can't kill her then. Idiot. Also we've had like at least 3 scenes of Ymir trying to push away Christa and Christa being all \"Nah b im stayin\" it's getting kinda old.\n\n\nIs there a reason Bertholt didn't transform once Eren escaped? Seems like he could help knock the titans away and recapture Eren. I know he's big and slow, but there's a lot of titans attacking the Scouts and he has the steam defense. Does his body just take longer to recharge because his form is huge?\n\n\nSo thought about this. If Eren recovers during this, couldn't he just bite the inside of his cheek? It's gotta be easier than biting through your hand, and it works even when bound and gagged. \n\n\nI wonder how that titan that ate Eren's mom wandered all the way out here. Also, no way Hannes doesn't die. They bring back this titan, of all titans, its near the end, Eren is frozen solid, and Hannes is defending Eren against the titan that he fled at the beginning that ate Eren's mom. This is the end for him."

I think you're more upset that the gag looks bad and it shouldn't stop him from doing so, which is fine. But the message with that is basically that with that gag, they can't bite anything at all. That's why during the Annie capture, gagging her was also very important, it's basically telling the viewer she can't bite at all. Poor way of showing it, but that's what we got."

Meaning the only thing important about Furious George is what he wants, which we don't know.\n\n\nWe know nothing about why Historia is so important besides that she might know something? But we have no hint what that is or why its important. We don't know why B&R want Eren other than their superiors are looking for the Coordinates or something like that (i forgot the word, they mentioned it once and I don't want to spoil myself looking it up), and Eren may or may not be that, whatever it is. Or what it does.Possibly his key? Basement? I dunno, and don't care since we don't know anything.\n\n\nSo we basically know nothing. If the next episode, which I think is the last of s2 (since I recall them saying its only a 12 episode season), ends with R&B getting away and Eren & Christa getting saved, we'll have learned about nothing. Something needs to be revealed next episode to make this worth it. Even if it just shows R&B getting back home and talking about the master plan with the bosses, or revealing what they think Eren is/why Christa is important.\n\n\nBut preferably someone gets captured and interrogated and reveals something please."

Not much more since it would mean revealing the foreshadowing. \n\nUnfortunately, a lot of this information you're looking for is **literally** given in the next manga arc (whose name itself is a spoiler). This current arc of season 2 served as a foreshadowing arc in the manga so that's why it seems so non-specific from your pov.\n\nOnce you've finished the next arc it's very easy to look back on this one and notice all the times Isayama was setting up a future concept, character, or plot point. I would recommend you begin **at least** reading the next manga arc after this season ends. It would be chapters 51/52 - 70 I believe (manga readers correct me on the exact ending chapter just in case). You can stop after, but I don't think you'll want to by that point lol."

I love it\n\n- SO FUCKING SCARY DONT SCARE HISTORIA\n\n- conny :[\n\n- fuck bertholdt but I feel bad for him, he had to do all this and I'm sure it took some strain emotionally, given that they're likely being forced to do this.\n\n- I KNEW IT. Granted it was obvious, but I knew they weren't doing it off their own accord.\n\n- mikasa ain't got time for your heartfelt bertholdt\n\n- good shit Erwin. Now just pray the proper folks live\n\n- I love Erwin he's so bold and focused\n\n- did that horse just look at the camera after it had its rider eaten?\n\n- I literally just said I love Erwin what the FUCK\n\n- okay that horse combo was funny\n\n- GO MIKASA\n\n- NO MIKASA\n\n- ARMIN WHAT\n\n- armin you look scary, you never look scary\n\n- oh shit the Annie card. Poor Annie if that's true.\n\n- it worked LOL\n\n- historia did something useful\n\n- CONNY NO\n\n- wait yes good point sasha\n\n- *sudden realization*\n\n- oh shit a titan bomb LOL\n\n- direct hit\n\n- okay now, what are the odds of it being that titan? It's not like that titan looks all that difficult to take down, though I do see Erin is kinda stuck in fear\n\n*end*\n\nThis episode didn't feel like it was five minutes at least. Holy shit tho finale next week. :["

Her conversation  with Historia really hit an emotional high note with me because while she's still as pragmatic as ever, her reasoning is so clear cut yet understandable.\n\nErwin is epic, basically as epic as Fuhrer Bradley and that's all that's needed to be said about him.\n\nNow for my complaints:\n\nI have not read the manga and I don't plan to. This anime is great and I'd rather just stick to it.\n\nI am disappointed that Historia did not immediately call out Ymir's lie when she said tried to deceive her into thinking she was being selfish. I know Historia is innocent and trusting but, as someone who's been so close as Ymir and is willing to sacrifice everything for her, I'm pretty disappointed by how little Historia understands Ymir.\n\nSecond, the final cliffhanger. So everyone's about to escape then Eren and Mikasa are faced with the titan who ate their mom. This.... is really out of no where. It has nothing to do the current, *intense* conflict happening but instead somehow Eren has to now face his past against a *normal* titan? Is this supposed to redirect his anger from Reiner and Berthold to avenging his mother? This has left me unexcited for the next episode and was a bad note to end on.\n\nThird, okay so the entire fight and desperate arguments were truly exhilarating and intense. Erwin bolsters morale to the point that everyone surges with the mindset that this battle will decide the fate of humanity. Amazing, spectacular, thrilling! \n\n*But* it's only a rescue mission... Erwin sacrifices an arm and an army to get back one person. He could have killed Berthold but he decides to keep his noggin in tack then take Eren. He could have killed the colossal titan there and then! Compared to Ymir's injuries when she defended the tower, Berthold will likely easily recover from it. \n\nI could be highly underestimating Eren's value to humanity. (Him being a titan who has sworn allegiance to humanity and holding *the* key to possibly the reason titan's all exist. But if the scout's could easily pursue Reiner's titan form, then they could have just tailed him. Bringing an army of titans was cool but overkill.\n\nGreat show though. Thrills galore\n"

I guess that's all they're good for considering that one idiot that somehow missed a giant 20-30 foot Titan standing right next to him.  Then Erwin gets snatched up by his arm and still keeps his eyes on the mission to retrieve Erwin.  After that he comes back and still fights and stands with his fellow soldiers at the very front.\n\nAlso Armin is a complete evil mastermind antagonizing Bertholdt like that.  He's probably the most underrated character given how crucial he is in certain points.  Armin definitely deserves some big things coming his way."

Meanwhile, they have to worry about shifters that might punch another hole in the wall.

This will be explored in later seasons.\n\n>what happened to Eren's dad\n\nThere are enough hints to figure this out, but this will be confirmed in S3 \n\n>what's in his basement (WHICH EREN HAS A FUCKING KEY TO AND DOESN'T EVEN GO THERE)\n\nEren can't go to the basement by himself, he would be overpowered by the vast number of titans in between him and Shiganshina. Furthermore the Survey Corps were planning to go the the basement at the start of this season but were stopped by Berty and Reiner making shit hit the fan.\n\n>why Bertholdt and Reiner desperately need Eren, and what's in their hometown\n\nThis will be partly answered next episode.\n\n\nI personally love this manga/anime because it's story is really interesting and presents many mysteries. later on it asks more philosophical questions that draw parallels to real life.

   "text": "Fanservice is when a production makes something to please fans, may this making a special couple canon or giving X character certain power. Sexual fanservice is called ecchi, you're mixing them up. And yes, Attack on titan is full of fanservice. \n\nAbout the other things you said you also missed a point about ecchi also im gonna make this a long post since i have seen some comments of you in this sub in the past, i just happened to remember your username by chance, theres two ways to use ecchi, the most hated one is putting ecchi elements in a show that doesn't even need it, thats the reason people hates ecchi, a sudden panty shot or whatever that does nothing for the story, i can completely understand the point here and the hate it recieves.\n\nThen theres true ecchi shows, this shows are purely made to show skin and character desing, it seems people doesn't get the super basic reason as to why this genre exists since a lot of people say ''idk why people like that trash, the story is bad and etc etc'' yes, we all know that, even I a fan of ecchi now it, because the point of ecchi shows is not even that, story is just an excuse in a ecchi show to give context to what all is happening but nothing more, the selling point of ecchi shows are fetishes and fantasies (if they're about self-insertion of not depends in the work, an example is ero manga sensei)\n\nHere comes the typical comment ''then why don't you go watch hentai or porn if you want to jerk off, virgin cunt weeb'' because hentai is stale as fuck and doesn't have the fetishes i like, for example i like the ''scantily clad female warrior'' thing, hentai is just about fucking and thats it, i can't find badass and hot looking female characters fighting shit and monsters in chain bikini in hentai (Queens Blade or Samurai Girls), and thats what turns me on or thats simply what i find attractive, so i have to go to ecchi, you understand now? (Thank god korean and japanese MMOs exist). Why would someone seek deep and interesting story in a genre that revolves around sexual fanservice? the moment you start putting too much sexually titillating themes in a production, automatically the quality drops and you start pandering to an specific niche that is actively seeking that themes in the products they want to consume. \n\nIs ok if someone wants to shit in the ecchi genre in general because objetively it is bad if you put it under the light of conventional standards but i really hate when the anime community in general starts kinkshaming fans of ecchi for enjoying something that they like, thats fucked up, theres nothing wrong in liking kinky shit and not everybody just watches anime solely for the story, i have known guys that just watch anime because they like pretty animation and they don't give a shit about story or dialogue, expecting that everyone should see something taking in count a ''pre-defined'' list of qualities is so arrogant. Peace.\n\n(Why i have to explain this basic thing to all people in r/anime? as a +20 years old and tired of explaining this shit to younger folks, ecchi and general fanservice in anime is absolutely nothing new, go see something from 1995, it was the same or even worse, japan has always been like this, what a surprise, it seems the new generations of anime fans just ignores anything from 2005 and before except from evangelion and the movies elitist likes, muh cowboy bepop, muh LotGH)\n\nedit. This comment is overly long and is not 100% directed and you, sorry there, i just got carried away writing and i started shooting everywhere and made the post like a bible, at least is gonna come in handy as copy paste if i need to explain why /ecchi exist/ to more redditors daily on here, sorry for using this space, lmao."
