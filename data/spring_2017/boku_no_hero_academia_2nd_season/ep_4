We're suppose to believe Todoroki is ultimately mature in his power, perhaps with some improvement from practice and aging (humans are most physically strong at an older age, like 30, so perhaps quirks are similar). He's also been trained from an early age relentlessly.\n\nDeku however only got his power like a year ago or whatever, has much much MUCH less practice and he hasn't matured into an adult either which will probably effect his power much more since as all might said earlier he needed to get stronger as a normal human before he could use the power properly so he'll get stronger in that sense, and if quirks are effected by age (which they defo seem to be) he'll also get stronger in THAT sense too. He also has to constantly worry about killing people and it held him back which will also go away, after all he could have one any time in the middle but he couldn't be sure not to kill Todoroki.\n\nHis power seems almost limitless in duration compared to without using his right side but as others have said he probably still has actual stamina rather than just frostbite to worry about. Deku on the other hand will always be more explosive, which is a good thing, in a full ass fight 20 years from now he can just explosively end it without dragging it out so stamina is less of a factor. He's still more mobile so Todoroki can't simply evade until Deku is fatigued."

This explains why the ice affects him. Assuming the fire follows the same rules, and from what we've seen it seems like it does, he has to generate flames with his own bodily energy. This means the flames have a limit, too. If he exhausts the flames power source, even with another trade off like burning himself, he can no longer mitigate the ice. Therefore, he is slightly stronger than endeavor, and has more utility do to the ice, but won't come close to matching all for one.\n\nThat said, if he only uses the fire to mitigate the ice, he can do some crazy bullshit until the power expires.

The percentage dialogue does not, in my opinion, refer to a future upper limit of Deku's strength.\n\nI don't think people should overthink it. Midorya has HIS OWN 100% and 5% options as of right now in the anime, nothing more. Trying to think of his 100% as being just 5% of OfA's potential power for him is kinda ridiculous and not concrete in terms of what has actually been said in the series. It's seemingly just some people's interpretation of something that I believe was referring to something else. Even IF Midorya's 100% can get stronger, I don't think the 5% mentioned in the context that it was (i.e. what Midorya can release without hurting himself) is referring to that. Again, it's just HIS 100% at that point.\n\nSimply put and simply what it seems All Might referred to - His 100% breaks his body, 5% is him holding back and delivering a blow that, while far weaker, lets him avoid hurting himself. Do. Not. Overthink. The. Percentages."

But as for examples of control without direct use against another human: during the cavalry battle, he used it indirectly against Todoroki to blow his hand away. Just before Full Cowl, he was using it to practice jumping. \n\nThe entire buildup to Full Cowl was about how he was too rigid. Before discovery, he was focused on what it means to be flexible and how to achieve it. As he discovers it, he says himself that his reactions were always delayed, then deduces he should flip all the switches from the very start to improve his reaction time. Even as Torino tests him again immediately after discovery, he talks about his reaction time. \n\nIt was never once mentioned (that I know of) that Full Cowl helps him keep his limbs intact, nor is it ever mentioned (that I know of) that Full Cowl helps him maintain 5% easier. The line you quoted only describes what he's doing differently. It doesn't say anything about how it's easier to hold 5%. I mean, you can say that not breaking limbs is the main benefit of the technique, but that's a claim that has to be inferred from the events in the manga and does not have direct lines supporting it. Everything the manga discusses before, during, and after Full Cowl is about his reaction time. \n"

So he's throwing out every single bit of that 5% of OfA that he can use.\" Says to me that he didn't try to reduce the output because he didn't have a choice. Maybe he could've reduced the output, maybe he couldn't have. But even Eraserhead says during his fight with Todoroki that \"his power's gone down, but he's gained some control.\" I don't see why it's unreasonable for me to \"insinuate\" that Deku has enough control over OfA to attack without destroying his limbs. Again, he did this already during the cavalry battle. Hell, even at 11:35 in this episode, you see him controlling it. If anything I don't see how you can say he can't control it. \n\n> Previously, a single OfA-powered leap would fracture both his legs.\n\nDidn't happen the night before he figured out Full Cowl when he wanted to practice wall jumping in the alleyway. \n\n> Despite the dialogue leading to his discovery of the technique, this clearly is the resolution to his biggest early obstacle as a hero.\n\nAs long as you recognize the dialogue doesn't support your claim, then that's fine by me. \n\n> Torino wasn't blaming All Might for failing to optimize Deku's reaction time, he was blaming him for the fact that Deku is nearly killing himself every time he tries to use his quirk. \n\nAgain, not supported by the dialogue. When Torino talks about how Deku's \"feelings of admiration for sense and responsibility too All Might have become Fetters. Shackles,\" what he says immediately before that is how Deku is \"rigid.\" But again, I guess if you want to lead into all your points with \"despite the dialogue,\" then there's nothing I can say since you seem to want to ignore the dialogue. \n\nI'll agree that he appears to be able to OfA much more freely after Full Cowl, and even though I disagree with your claim that it helps him prevent him from breaking his limbs, it's a valid inference. However, he himself, nor anyone else for that matter, says or suggests anything along the lines of \"Full Cowl helps me control my power and not break my limbs.\" \n\n"

He felt he'd reached his absolute peak so his only option left was to create a legacy stronger than himself. \n\nA small part of it could have been that personal drive though. That desire to always better oneself. Perhaps his jealousy toward All Might was more about his frustrations with his own limitations. All Might as the constant reminder that Endeavor had done all he could, gone as far as he could possibly go, and there was still plenty of room beyond that where he would never be able to go. \n\nThe way I see it, Endeavor is an example of who Bakugou *could* turn out to become. I think Endeavor's real purpose in this story is to show where Bakugou could go if he doesn't get the development he needs. Basically an example that we can compare later on when/if Bakugou heads down a better path so he doesn't become like Endeavor. I have faith in Horikoshi to do Bakugou's character justice though. The only reason he made Bakugou so incredibly unlikable is so he's that much more likable once his character has fully developed. \n\nEndeavor is at a pretty interesting point in the story right now. I'm really curious to see where his character goes now. I won't say anything about it because it's a giant spoiler, but if you're curious, give the manga a try. It's an amazing read and if you think the show is good now, well let me tell you there are things 100x better coming up. My absolute favorite fight of the series so far (manga readers know which one I'm talking about) won't happen until about halfway through season 3 of the anime, assuming they keep up with the same chapter to episode ratio they've been following. \n\nIf you do consider reading the manga, this episode covered chapters 38, 39, and a couple of pages into chapter 40. If you want to start the manga, I'd start right at the beginning of chapter 40. They're doing an amazing job adapting this as close to the source material as possible. Scenes in the manga get put directly into the anime with very few changes. So you can comfortably start at chapter 40 without missing anything.\n\nIf you do end up reading the manga, come join us over at /r/BokuNoHeroAcademia. New manga chapters come out every Thursday and we have discussions over there about them."

She was literally having a phone call with her family demonstrating that she consciously recognized that her phobia of the left side of his face was irrational - in fact, it suggests she was *creating an excuse that would allow her to justify harming him*, both to herself and others.  Stress doesn't make you insane or lose control over your faculties, that's a myth propagated by people who don't want to take responsibility for their actions.\n\nExcessive stress creates a compulsion for stress release.  Compulsions are not insanity.  She could go punch a tree .  Instead she took it out on a defenseless child who trusted her, both as a deliberate way to harm the child as well as the father.\n\nYou see, she wanted to hurt him.  Having a defenseless, lovable child be part of the reason why you suffer is in many ways worse than if the architect of your suffering could be blamed.  Not being able to blame or hate that which causes you pain and suffering creates stress and cognitive dissonance; she could release the stress rather easily if she could think about and treat her child as some evil enemy, but of course she can't.  You have the stress of the suffering compounded upon the stress of not being able to hate them... and then you have the added stress of hating and feeling disgusted at yourself whenever thoughts like \"I wish they were never born\" or \"doesn't he realize how much I'm suffering for him\" inevitably cross your mind, since of course it's not their fault that this is happening, and he's only five so how would he understand?\n\nSo you have the basic stress, plus the stress of having to be nice, plus the stress of hating yourself.  In desperation you begin looking for excuses like \"I can't stand the sight of his face\" or \"the kids are always acting like their father\" in order to internally and externally justify the abuse you're about to perpetuate.  And then you pour boiling hot water onto a 5 year old kid, and everybody says you didn't intend to do it, weren't aware that you were doing it, or couldn't have chosen not to do it, when you totally did and totally could.  She was a functioning, mature adult, presumably with a career and a job.  There are far more constructive ways for her to release stress than abusing her children."

That means is a-ok right? It's such a cool backstory to be trained since young age by the equivalent of a feral bear you have to call \"father\". \n\n/s\n\nLook, I understand that training in something since young is a cool idea, hell I still regret bailing out on karate when I was like 9. But you see, me training in karate would be my hobby, my side activity that I would continue to pursue (or not) when older. That training was Todoroki life, can you imagine getting beaten up most of the days while being verbally abused and watching your mother, the only warm thing in your life, being assaulted by this monster? All for reasons his non-developed mind can't quite comprehend? That's an actual living nightmare man.\n\nI like Endeavor's character but you have to realise he is an unholy piece of shit while still being a paragon of herodom? heroness? Heroism. He is pretty much a highly functional socially accepted (or tolerated at least) psycopath. And you have to be fucking blind to not realise that."

Not merely beating him up out of frustration or rejecting that kids existence so the kids become his punching bag till he dies. Like what happened in ERASED. \n\nBut it is not the case right now, Endeavour is a father who forcefully planting his dream towards his son. In a way Todoroki indeed become very powerful in a very young age, and will no doubt become one of the strongest  when he grow up. It benefits both Endeavour and Todoroki from any view you look at it. The only things that bad about this is he remove the freedom to do anything else on his kid, but thats common and happening everywhere even in real life so at a point this action acceptable in the society.(you can ask any chinese family with big company how their father forced his son to learn business to take over the company when they grow up)"

We can like stuff but still recognize where it's problematic.\n\nTo Miyasaki's point about being too steeped in the niche culture and a poor student of human psychology, MHA is pretty overtly a marriage of anime tropes with US comic book heroes. I think it does a better than average job of portraying humanity, but probably because both sources are kinda terrible on average."

Does anyone really watch the series because they get turned on by Midnight's sexual attire, rank and pick \"best\" girls based on who tickles their pickle the most, and consider Mineta's perverseness to be of any significant value? I'd say that's not what MHA is really going for.\n\nMHA is not in any way realistic, given its battle-shonen and comicbook superhero influences, but that's totally fine for that kind of genre. I think Miyasaki's point is more angled towards anime which is supposedly in a realistic setting (eg slice of life, highschool, romance, etc) yet clearly made without any consideration for how real human beings would actually interact beyond satisfying fantasies and embodying tropes without much depth. That's the kind of stuff that's basically a feedback loop for otakus who become disjointed from reality."

Deku losing this fight was the best way for the story to go right now.\n\n> It wouldn't be a very good story about Deku's road to the top if he reached the top too quickly. He's already had some pretty significant victories for this arc. He won the race without even using his quirk. He evaded almost everyone in the cavalry battle and managed to grab a headband from Todoroki (even if it wasn't the correct headband) while also making Todoroki use his fire in combat for the first time, setting the ground work for their upcoming 1v1 fight. Then he overcame brainwashing with his incredible resolve (All Might confirmed it wasn't One For All that saved him there). And finally he won the moral victory by making Todoroki finally accept his quirk as his own power instead of as his father's power.\n\n> Deku did a LOT of winning this arc. It was time for him to take a loss, before he forgets what losing even feels like. He still needs to lose every now and then to understand why he's fighting and how far he still has to come.\n \n> Besides, Deku would have won if he had let Todoroki continue using only his ice. But a true hero doesn't let someone else suffer when they have a chance to save them. Deku knowingly threw away his best chance at winning this fight in order to save his classmate from himself. That's the greatest victory he could have achieved."

I'm usually not a Blu-Ray guy, but there are so many amazing scenes that would look better without the dim that I just may have to make an exception. Looking for a bit of clarification on the last scene of the fight though. Deku goes at full power and opens his palm. Was he trying to grab todoroki(or maybe block the force from the explosion)? I noticed after he got blown away his right arm wasn't broken so I guess he didn't get off a full force swing(or arm thrust)?"

   "text": "He could not make a fist cos his fingers were torn to shreds. As for the arm, it conveys he now has more control over OfA than he did prior. He probably got blown away coz he was already airborne. Todoroki was standing, with an ice wall behind him. If Deku had accelerated off his rear foot (I don't even know why they did it off the front, its unnatural), then spotted a landing for his left foot, and use OfA on his left leg and right arm simultaneously, to power himself into the punch, Todoroki would have been the one sent flying. He probably dosen't have that much control yet, though. OfA accelerates you so quickly, after all... so jumping with your lead foot from  50 metres away probably Happens as fast as throwing a punch point blank."

If Todoroki didn't give it his all and Deku won because of it, I think it would have been an empty victory for him. This way it was a truly *fair* fight.

You kind of understand the structure of a society with quirks, you know how heroes fit into it, we've met our protagonists, last season introduced the Villain Alliance without giving away much about them. And then you have a tournament arc which is a ton of fun and serves to really give individual attention to our primary cast since up until now everything has been very Deku-focused.\n\nThe upcoming arc establishes the tone of the story from that point onwards. It gives definition to both Deku's current position as a student by framing him against the real world of heroes and villains, and gives much more meaning into what it is to \"succeed All Might\". It also serves to hash out what direction the villain Alliance will take, and particularly gives purpose and direction to Shigaraki while revealing more of what's behind them.\n\nIt also introduces more of the thematic elements of the story beyond the usual shounen \"try hard, believe in your friends\" stuff. It brings in the big picture."

What that means for Bakugo is that he can still knock him away, blast him into the air, and get him out of the ring instead of focusing on ensuring Kirishima can't fight anymore. \n\nPlus, there's the fact that Hardening against explosions is a double-edged sword. Being that durable means Bakugo can go all out without fear of destroying his opponent utterly. Imagine the explosion he used on the meteor swarm but aimed at Kirishima. Bakugo has the raw knockback and mobility to win this fight, even if he can't necessarily \"damage\" Kirishima."

The result was that major channels created an automated system that would reduce the brightness of flashy scenes when they were strung together. This means that scenes with fast cuts and explosive action have a reduced chance of triggering seizures or other ocular based reactions, as pallette is muted, reducing the amount of information hammering the eye without forcing the show to cut anything"

Of course we knew that he could get too cold, but since he has his fire side to heat himself back up, it did seem like he could just use them infinitely.\n\nBut even while using his fire to regulate his body temperature, Todoroki still has a limit on how much ice he can use, or vice versa for how much fire he can use. Part of the process of becoming a hero is training your quirk to increase that stamina. Endeavor has his fire on all the time, mostly for intimidation. But he wasn't able to do that when he was his son's age. Only after years of exercising his quirk was he able to keep it always on without draining his stamina."

Then he overcame brainwashing with his incredible resolve (All Might confirmed it wasn't One For All that saved him there). And finally he won the moral victory by making Todoroki finally accept his quirk as his own power instead of as his father's power.\n\nDeku did a LOT of winning this arc. It was time for him to take a loss, before he forgets what losing even feels like. He still needs to lose every now and then to understand why he's fighting and how far he still has to come.\n\nBesides, Deku would have won if he had let Todoroki continue using only his ice.

Like, a double off-stage \"tie\"... except Deku is obviously way too injured to do a tiebreaker, so Todoroki moves on through the bracket.\n\nEh, from my perspective I either go 100% in on the overpowered protagonist side of things (Mahouka being an example) or I like fights to be somewhat realistic; Deku was outmatched and cannot control his quirk, if he won then it would have felt very plot armor-esque to me since Todoroki has an inherently OP quirk with significant training to it.\n\nHe worked his ass off preceding the fight and gave it his all during the fight and still lost; nothing wrong with that, it adds humility to his character knowing that he isn't at the top yet and adds quite a bit of relatability to him. Sometimes, no matter how hard you prepare and try, you just don't win.\n\nPlus Todoroki's win here does add a lot to *his* character. If he finally embraced his fire side and then *lost* then his character development would pretty much halt; his growth lays in the fact that he needs to embrace the power that he doesn't want to acknowledge, a power that allowed him to beat his most worthy rival thus far."

He's clearly been resolved to reject his flame side since he was a child(when he was burned). The fact that he knew exactly how to use it instead of losing and realizing that he still has much more room to grow by now working on his fire side as well plays better to me than him suddenly adding an entirely new dynamic to his fighting style and perfectly executing it.

You are jumping to conclusions, based on your experiences and because of biases having read source material. It was well adapted, and most people loved it, it's one of fan favourites.  \nIt's VN readers who complain most about it then assume (incorrectly) what non-VN readers get from it. Look up [Episode 21](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/37v47r/spoilers_fatestay_night_unlimited_blade_works/) discussion here on reddit, nothing there supports your assertion.  \n\nHell, there are even VN readers that don't fully understand things. There are always people who won't understand something when you need to pay attention, it's nothing new. So some people not getting something means nothing.  \n\nThe fight definitely shouldn't have been longer, given how many people thought it was too long, and if it was shorter then it would obviously be harder to understand things. It was full of nuances, symbolism and multiple times spelling things out to the audience. Seriously, there are a lot more anime that are a lot more confusing and unclear, with tons of people \"not getting it\", it doesn't necessarily mean it was badly written or executed per se.

   "text": ">nothing there supports your assertion.\n\ni was obviously making hyperbole i already admitted that there are some people who dont understand something, there are people who dont understand many things, there are people who dont pay attention and genuinely dumb people, so what are you talking about? The thread shows how many people liked the episode, the fight the resolution but you suggested the opposite. No MOST people DONT feel this way. VN readers are mostly those who made the loudest complaints, \"Duh they didn't include xyz from VN, they failed, that's why people dont understand!\". Sure, whatever...\n\nThey delivered the message, most people received it. You should stop asserting that which is simply convenient to your own view of the show, when that isn't even really the case. Your assumptions about \"other\" people don't make an argument.\n\nThis thread has like 2 ppl \"complaining\".\nAnd I already said, some people not understanding means nothing, that's not evidence for anything other than their lack of understanding or that they didn't pay enough attention. Yes lots of people didn't understand crucial things about Eva and many other great anime. Your reasoning just doesnt stackup. It's not consistent with what we can easily verify. \n\nBesides you should judge solely based on your own experience, don't use other people as criticism, when your assumptions of their interpretations aren't even true.  \n\n>memeing about \"just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right\"\n\nso? They are memeing, because its memeable line. Lets not forget that it's not exactly what was said in japanese but rather its a subtitle, which may add some difficulty for some people to understand, and a lot of people aren't even natively english, so that's even another layer of potential difficulty, then there are people with short attention spans etc. You know that this is true.  \n\n\"just because you're correct doesn't mean you're right\" is only a translation of the original. Nothing wrong with memeing funny-sounding translation.  \nSeriously, dont use other people as your way of criticizing the show, think about your own experience.\n\n"

I cried, I cried, I cried some more. \n\nI feel it's time to officially announce that My Hero Academia is my favourite anime. \n\nDeku showing that there are more important things than winning some dumb tournament, like saving people. A true hero.\n\nOur Deku has come a [long way](https://i.imgur.com/bkKiGoi.jpg), what is [pain](https://i.gyazo.com/707b3586e9e1ac03eb13c15c93cc081f.jpg)?\n\nThis episode marks the start line for the series. This is where My Hero Academia begins to go beyond, plus ultra style. Take note anime only people, this is a series that will get even better. \n\nTo say that this episode had a lot of screenshotworthy moments is an understatement, hold my fucking beer guys.\n\nDeku the absolute madman pics [1](https://i.gyazo.com/6e60059d67558023c3172a4a75e5b281.jpg), [2](https://i.gyazo.com/b481d74b7d24b84a9bceb01b817dc995.jpg), [3](https://i.gyazo.com/3efb3ed2eb806c226e699425665da76c.jpg), [4](https://i.gyazo.com/2e6277a611cf624a380f4522f70980a9.jpg), [5](https://i.gyazo.com/89281a67ef55c1c8bd748ee74fdfe3ec.jpg), [6](https://i.gyazo.com/086a829082de0f00e9285c1871d5fbe1.jpg), [7](https://i.gyazo.com/1cc7d83545c5fd33225ba05a996adccd.jpg), [8](https://i.gyazo.com/a2028763779e630e56b1c35589f29a77.jpg), [9](https://i.gyazo.com/a921ce60a86b21080cfab4dd31ca830f.jpg), [10](https://i.gyazo.com/05ac82a85910bd3d4df27279a235fbb9.jpg), [11](https://i.gyazo.com/1a450340d820ea5c0f58570e07259844.jpg), [12](https://i.gyazo.com/f3905f2cc2ac175b211aebacc5dd29d0.jpg), [13](https://i.gyazo.com/3d0cca2bc1ee2f8f92032dd110d3b804.jpg), [14](https://i.gyazo.com/0a5513fa378e42e16b6e4933b6f0b569.jpg), [15](https://i.gyazo.com/090cc0041c1341dcfa62d9380b3f786a.jpg), [16](https://i.gyazo.com/c9e35a984295233cf91b854a931e8396.jpg), [17](https://i.gyazo.com/ae28ecb9508026b26b557b6a351eace0.jpg), [18](https://i.gyazo.com/03744ffd73541061153382023383e6ce.jpg), [19](https://i.gyazo.com/ccb2bbfcfc7ef4dbdd6b5ac5d42b8ca8.jpg), [20](https://i.gyazo.com/4a5db06fbb2c04a3801dada8d544bde7.jpg), [21](https://i.gyazo.com/77bed10cd317af3fe2c2ca7bd8a9b1ce.jpg), [22](https://i.gyazo.com/095f02fbb4ec99af33e07156eafec42e.jpg), [23](https://i.gyazo.com/feed4bf17fea8e81a56d9490e0a6c2bb.jpg), [24](https://i.gyazo.com/6dc987d15c0445d4e7b0c2394884b6ad.jpg), [25](https://i.gyazo.com/a054396ec555cc7c8e7982a111f56055.jpg), [26](https://i.gyazo.com/e0f001816fae5016a9d5b2f72f52384b.jpg), [27](https://i.gyazo.com/027eca34af45cb9c3cd90f9368376e76.jpg), [28](https://i.gyazo.com/39bdd2041280deca76ad7524e672d444.jpg), [29](https://i.gyazo.com/ff83df0578d4a837607bec9e10764585.jpg), [30](https://i.gyazo.com/7b125ecda026588683632c6c38574705.jpg), [31](https://i.gyazo.com/c06ef675265d02c8c61b7d6d96127a72.jpg), [32](https://i.gyazo.com/92b4fb98b0ac1648d2ed87dcb76a6b7b.jpg), [33](https://i.gyazo.com/b2c4ca0442779bbeda141e6bdca8f8e5.jpg), [34](https://i.gyazo.com/e9de24937c368aaf267d3deb7b925da3.jpg), [35](https://i.gyazo.com/6620a2c13117dc4d019bace2cd9a855b.jpg), [36](https://i.gyazo.com/0938da590504ac1409d9d98fbef71187.jpg), [37](https://i.gyazo.com/db4f398d570f92ca57a411f9dc6089be.jpg), [38](https://i.gyazo.com/805b410480a82b7b507c3edd476276af.jpg), [39](https://i.gyazo.com/c9564e7fad2d49ab8d802cb979bd807b.jpg), [40](https://i.gyazo.com/c4ef39509e7bfb2c424559d7ff73872d.jpg), [41](https://i.gyazo.com/a7fdf3805f645000f5cb14738b6bab70.jpg), [42](https://i.gyazo.com/02036b7aae651d41d5a9fa21d0164551.jpg), [43](https://i.gyazo.com/a2b3413d2c486b39fa38163d71a71f1d.jpg), [44](https://i.gyazo.com/2a393648bebb7177203c50e5365d47ae.jpg), [45](https://i.gyazo.com/5cfd31aa4ec3d653dfbba6e75c26ac52.jpg), [46](https://i.gyazo.com/ee1093686e7d74549b0252c6ea7a9033.jpg), [47](https://i.gyazo.com/b4f8f1c8b81589b1a4a93b544a784305.jpg), [48](https://i.gyazo.com/4ee36a43291148254c153cf7f677d936.jpg), [49](https://i.gyazo.com/0aebe721b32e00aceae2382ef4821729.jpg), [50](https://i.gyazo.com/b0f82c96b98d836fbb7c17ad951b1bcb.jpg), [51](https://i.gyazo.com/8295fbff5423621680cf7521fe2e7962.jpg) and [52](https://i.gyazo.com/420fc0231cadf37997b8eabc7b8ed8de.jpg)\n\nTodoroki the absolute sadman [1](https://i.gyazo.com/8fba5ecdb90c8d5997e3405b78fc93d2.jpg), [2](https://i.gyazo.com/114caadd2b79d741911e5faffd72e255.jpg), [3](https://i.gyazo.com/3438d746cb475830b57c650c3237ccd2.jpg), [4](https://i.gyazo.com/666d3c5cb78b481a432cf343c3a1dab2.jpg), [5](https://i.gyazo.com/18e23868e86c7603b3cf560e212b2082.jpg), [6](https://i.gyazo.com/58f04193123f89f5374dea383cb3835c.jpg), that tear tipped me over the edge, [7](https://i.gyazo.com/ce3ac266578bf77dac5a8909bf6c6a31.jpg) and [8](https://i.gyazo.com/26ae6f611c60cd31ab627bf76228c646.jpg)\n\nTodo, that is [a lot of ice](https://i.gyazo.com/b717141583e37ad58dc13942631cd190.jpg).

Nothing comes close to the new symbol of peace for me but I think Deku losing here was the right step, if he beat one of the most broken and OP characters in the show (seriously the limit to one of his powers is fixed by the other, how the fuck do you beat that?) before he even could use his Quirk properly, it would be a little much this early on. \n\nI wonder what Midoriya and Todoroki's dynamic will be from here on out. Friends? Rivals? Back to the same? Will Todoroki still be so cold (lol) to him and the other heroes?\n\nI'm still kinda sad that Midoriya lost though, to go through so much and push himself beyond the limit just to fail must be an unimaginable level of frustration. He had his own agenda, he needed to announce himself, and to lose in front of All Might and the world as the new symbol of peace, and lose 3 of your 4 limbs in the process, my god, poor Izuku. \n\nAlso I'm really pumped for whenever Midoriya finally uses Plus Ultra, I thought he was gonna this episode, no dice but (if)when he does, holy shit strap in your seatbelts ladies and gentlemen"

They have nearly 3 full years, before they even graduate. That's a hell of a lot of time. What sort of progress could be made in that time, if he already beats one of his major rivals? Deku's been training, with heroics as his goal, for about a year. As we can see in this episode, Todoroki's been training since at least he was 5 years old (so 10 years or so prior to the current time). Deku is yet to receive specified extended training, in order to hone his quirk and general fighting skills. Todoroki on the other hand has been working non-stop for over a decade with the country's number 2 hero breathing down his neck. It made sense for Todoroki to win, and so he won. That's the way a well-written show goes, i'm afraid. It is indeed Deku's story, and thankfully there's a hell of a long way to go. He'll have his time, as we know, thanks to the retrospective narration. But for now? He has to build to that point. It's about the journey, and losing is a part of that."

Matches don't have to be flashy to be interesting, its about the nuances and the attention to detail, and the development (both current and future) it'll have on the participants.\n\nMidnight didn't make Izuku go to sleep. Her quirk didn't reach him. He was genuinely knocked out from the force of the clash and the lingering pain of his previous injuries. And Izuku's attack in this instance wasn't physical. He didn't punch. He used an open palmed thrust (as he couldn't clench his fist any longer) in the hope the shockwaves would knock Todoroki out of bounds. Neither of the two hit the blocks. They both sent shockwaves which destroyed the blocks (but their existence served to limit the power of the resulting clash, and made sure neither competitor died). Izuku lost because he had no way to avoid being out of bounds. Todoroki always had his ice, in order to create an obstacle between him and the edge of the ring."

I felt the same way when All might told Deku that he could become a hero. \n\n\nI really didn't expect Deku to loose this early in the competition but it's also a great way to show that despite having this amazing power it doesn't mean that he will easily get to the top. So... who will be in the finals? My guess is obv. going to be Todoroki and Bakugou because they together with Deku feel like the top 3 of the class and their battle prowess is also above many in the B class. I vote for Todoroki to take it all, this has been his arc and what's better way to end it than letting him take it all?"

In pretty much any of these, the moment a visible bone break happens, the ref will step in and stop the match on the spot.

Right before Deku and Todoroki use their finishing moves on each other, we see Cemetoss and Midnight trying to prevent  the two of them from causing severe damage to one another... Cemetoss puts up walls between the two fighters, and Midnight sends out her sleep inducing pheromone... After the dust settles, only one of them is a sleep/knocked out... My question then is, did Deku lose the fight because Midnight put him to sleep as they were colliding, or was Deku knocked out as a result of the collision? My first conclusion was that Deku was blown back and hit the stadium wall with such force that it knocked him out... But after seeing Midnight attempting to halt the two fighters, I'm now questioning if Deku lost only because Midnight chose to stop him vs Todoroki (assuming she couldn't reach both fighters in time, or doesn't have the ability to spread her pheromones that wide).\n\nI know it's not gonna change the outcome, I just wonder if Deku could have survived/not been K/Oed after that huge explosion... I wants believe that Midnight stopped him, and that Deku could have kept going, that he would have stopped himself from going out of bounds, and would have been still conscious. Anyways, any input would be great."

And if Todoroki would've lost, it would be his problem for not taking this seriously when some are literally breaking their bones for reaching the top.\n\nP.S.\nOFC I loved this episode, the whole composition of animation, drama, music, feels, character development, insights which I rewatched 4-5 times but that just rubs me in a bad way.

Todoroko also regularly put ice walls behind him to keep him in place against shockwaves. As Deku is at this moment, there was no way he could beat Todoroki in a one v. one all out fight. hell, I'm not even sure if he could where the manga is at at the moment.

The fight simply wasn't as exciting as it was hyped up to be and imo very forgettable, besides that last attack.\n\nPersonally, I preffer it much more when the emotional core is formed before the fight(an example of that is the three way fight in Rage of Bahamut. All the motivations and backstories were known before the fight. When the fight happened, it was almost non stop action with very little dialogue and no flashbacks at all).
