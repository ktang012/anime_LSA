Sadly the one who is doing the garbage collection here is you while the *dickhead you* gets to do all the *input/output* ( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0) he wants. Sucks to be you man.\n\n[](#cantbehelped)\n\nNow you say, \"Bu- but that's now how it is. When I slept for those 8 hours, I slept for *him* **and** *myself*! Beat that!\"\n\n[](#faito)\n\nLet me tell you why that train of thought is going to destination fucked.\n\n[](#gendo-pls)\n\nConsider this example,    \nYou're trying to get in shape for summer so you can show off your hulking ripped body and get all the girls. You're in the gym, running on that treadmill getting a good workout. Now, An interesting thing happens in the body when doing physical work -\n\n> When you exercise, your body uses oxygen to break down glucose for energy. During intense exercise, there may not be enough oxygen available to complete the process, so a substance called lactate is made. Your body can convert this lactate to energy without using oxygen. But this lactate or lactic acid can build up in your bloodstream faster than you can burn it off.    \n\nSo, lactic acid is building up and your body starts aching because of it. But your workout is not done yet. If you stop now, you'll never get those six packs. When everything seems like it's heading towards despair, a great idea hits you. Why not just let the \"other me\" take care of it?\n\n[**Genius!**](#smugpoint)\n\nWell, how would you do that? Magically transfer all the lactic acid deposited in your body across another dimension?    \nLet's say you *were* able to do that. What happens to all that lactic acid then? It's got to go somewhere, it can't just pop out of existence. Well, the other you across the anisotropic has to take care of it. He was going to bone his beautiful anisotropic girlfriend and now all of a sudden there's all this lactic acid in his body. Sucks to be him.\n\n[](#yuishrug)\n\nNow hold on a second\n\n[](#bestiacheckyourprivilage)\n\nDidn't he rest already? He should've rested for both of \"you\"s (because by some buttfuck logic, being aware of his existence allowed you to put that burden on him). But we can't just throw that lactic acid out of the equation. We seem to have encountered a contradiction here. It can only mean that our initial assumption was wrong. Since, it is scientifically proven that our body produces lactic acid, its not this one. So, the other assumption, that \"one you can rest for both of 'you's, except that he is only resting enough for one person\" must be wrong.\n\nIn the end, the other you is fucked. What a bizarre case of inter-dimensional bullying.\n\n[](#nyanpasu)\n\nSoon, we'll see commercials in the anime - \"Got a terminal disease? Just do the *salsa* and give it to the \"other\" you across the anisotropic, he'll die for you because he clearly isn't *you* and fuck anything that isn't *you*!\"\n\n***\n\nEdit : I'm sorry if this comment sounded a little mean but I am just tired of people throwing half-ass arguments without any plausibility or consideration for holes in their logic."

And by applying that vague theory to a real life example, all I have proved is that \"sharing\" sleep in this context does not mean that one party sleeping for 8 hours = 8 hours worth of sleep for both parties, which, questions the credibility of your theory of \"multi-threaded application\" in relation to my queries.\n\nFurthermore, lactic acid is such a simple example compared to sleep, which, in fact, is something so complex that we still don't fully understand it's exact function. On top of which, it is something so essential that you will die if you don't get any sleep for more than a couple weeks. Assuming that \"multithreaded application\" theory can be applied to explain *that* and not something much simpler is absurd.\n\nAlso, by saying that \"we don't know enough to equate such intricate examples onto this issue\" and asking *me* questions about the assumptions of *your* theory regarding threads, you're giving off an impression that you didn't think things through when you started advocating for the \"multithreaded application\" theory.\n\nStill I'll join you. So, let's try to answer a few of those questions. I'll be answering them under the assumption that \"threads\" refers to 3 Dimensional bodies and does not consider the consciousness residing in those bodies. My argument for the existence of consciousness in other bodies is -    \n\n**Assumption** : All 3 dimensional worlds (or slices) are similar in their composition, i.e., they contain the same matter. This assumption is essential if we are to \"transfer\" or \"share\" sleep - something which is related to the body's physiology, hence, it is required that both bodies in question must have similar physiology.    \n**Argument** : If in this 3 dimensional world (or slice), *your* body possessed a consciousness even before it was aware of those other bodies, then those bodies, as they reside in a similar 3 dimensional universe separated by the anisotropic, just like you, must possess a consciousness as well.\n\nNow, on to those questions :\n\n* How are\", if they are, the \"threads\" synced? Does damage to one equate to damage to the other?    \nWe don't have enough information to make reasonable conjectures here. We only know that they exist, but we do not know anything about their parent (i.e., the \"greater individual\") or how things operate at higher dimensions.    \nAs for whether or not they share \"damage\" my argument is - If they can share sleep, they should be able to do that as well. Because sleep has a biological function as it is necessary for survival (we don't *exactly* know what it is), and pain and damage are biological phenomenons as well. So, if they can share one biological function, then they can share others as well.\n\n* Were there always multiples \"threads\"?    \nYes. For the said \"greater individual\" to exist, all of his components must exist as well. Granted we only have zaShunina's word as the only evidence to support the existence of this \"greater individual\". For the time being, we're assuming that he isn't bullshitting us.\n\n* If so, did they get used?    \nIf they existed before we were aware of them, then yes. Just like we were using our \"threads\" before we became aware of the existence of other threads.\n\n* Maybe the action of sleeping was the syncing of the \"threads\" and iteratively switching between each \"thread\" for every day. Maybe before, sleeping took more than 8 hrs, and it took 8hrs to switch to the next \"thread\" and during the next day the previous \"thread\" sleeps more.    \nAs stated before, we do not know what the underlying mechanism is, so any number of assumptions can be made in that regard. \n\n* What if the other bodies only manifested themselves after we learn of the higher dimension?    \nA philosophical question with no clear, definitive answer. If you were to consider this from a scientific point of view, then I'll point you to the famous Schr\u00f6dinger's cat experiment. It boils down to something like this - \"At the quantum level, reality does not exist if you are not looking at it.\" So, the answer to your question will be - \"We can't say because we weren't looking.\"\n\n***\n\nNow, before you start typing your answer, I'll ask you to reconsider my initial query. Which is : \n\n> How does your \"awareness\" of an extra dimension somehow rids you of the need to sleep?"

   "text": "> but there's no known reason why being awake is a problem\n\n\"Harmful consequences of sleep deprivation have been described in many studies. Most dramatically, prolonged sleep deprivation leads to death. Rats kept awake using the disk-over-water method develop a peripheral syndrome characterized by increased metabolic rate and decreased body weight, which culminates in death after 2\u20134 wk.\"\n\nHumans rapidly progress towards full blown psychosis during long periods of sleep deprivation, and just like the rats, eventually die.\n\n> Whether or not sleep loss is lethal, sleep deprivation has two consequences that never fail to occur. The first one is intrusion of sleep into wakefulness. When wakefulness is enforced, sleep pressure increases and sleep cannot be avoided, irrespective of stimulation.\n\n> The second documented consequence of sleep deprivation is performance deterioration, especially cognitive impairment. Partial sleep restriction also impairs cognitive performance, although subjects may not realize that they are impaired.\n\n> there is no convincing case of a species that does not sleep, no clear instance of an animal that forgoes sleep without some compensatory mechanism, and no indication that one can truly go without sleep without paying a high price. What many concluded long ago still seems to hold: the case is strong for sleep serving one or more essential functions.    \n[*Source*](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.0060216)\n\nA few arguments are that sleep has :\n\n* A *neural function* as it is the brain that takes the most \"damage\" from not sleeping\n\n* A *cellular function* : relieving cellular \"stress\" in the brain\n\n* A function that cannot be provided by quiet wakefulness and that benefits from environmental disconnection\n\n***\n\n> Sansa helps you become aware of your other dimensional bodies, which in turn lets you manipulate them.\n\nHuman consciousness is fairly limited in how much control it has over the human body. Can you regulate, with conscious effort, your digestive system? Your heart beat? Blood circulation? Metabolism? You can't. Most people can't follow more than 4-5 variables in their head without using a pen and a paper, and you're talking about manipulating the whole human body across a higher dimension, with conscious attention.\n\nNot only that, if you are switching \"bodies\", then you're also switching your brains (because sleep deprivation has negative effects in the brain), then how do you know the \"brain\" you've switched possesses the same consciousness? That it is the same \"you\". It could have been \"doing\" something else in that dimension, \"being\" something else. Being aware of that body should also include an awareness of its \"being\". The way it is shown is as if there are all these bodies \"on standby\", and you can switch to the one that is \"fresh\" while the one that is \"exhausted\" gets some rest. \n\nNow, showing that aspect of \"multiple beings\" will lead to complications that can't be resolved easily, which is why I think that this explanation of \"switching bodies\" or a \"body in higher dimension that sleeps for you\" is hard to wrap my head around. It would have been much easier to assume that *salsa* somehow changed their physiology, hence, eliminating the need for sleep altogether.\n\nStill, this awareness of higher dimension ties in nicely with the \"wam theory\", which makes me think - Will those three now be able to make wams as they posses the \"understanding\" of the anisotropic now after experiencing *salsa*?    \nProbably yes."

A history textbook in Japan would paint a different picture of WW2 than a history textbook in the US (and neither of them would really include everything that happened).

And you don't need to pick up a book to learn about that.\n\nOf course, this is not saying that studying History is useless. Having objective records of past instances of an event can help a lot to combat unfortunate events in the future (though an in-depth analysis of the present would be sufficient to indicate the same, but it's about saving time). And studying History can save you from a lot of trouble. But in zaShunina's context, where he is learning about countries and human nature, those textbooks are a poor example. Because every country writes their own story, and to really get an idea of how things are, without human biases, you will have to look at the present.    \nWhich is why he should just scan those books quickly and start observing."

Enough that instead of directly murdering them (which they also did sometimes), they would starve them by pointing their guns out of trains and shooting the Buffalo herds. I would argue that while some mixing did happen, the majority of mixing happened between British, African and Americans.
