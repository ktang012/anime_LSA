The casual kissing reminds me of a certain witch show (which I do enjoy seeing it being casual and not some kind of taboo that lots of romances like to do), the BL loving angel reminds me of the MC from [Watashi ga Motete Dousunda](https://myanimelist.net/anime/32899/Watashi_ga_Motete_Dousunda) and the general over-the-top group antics reminds me of [Jitsu wa Watashi wa](https://myanimelist.net/anime/29785/Jitsu_wa_Watashi_wa).\n\nThese kind of shows tend to have issues regarding pacing with the source material like with Jitsu wa Watashi wa and the Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches but hopefully this show will prove me otherwise."

Stabbing Seiji multiple times, switching from evil to innocent when Seiji's soul may go to Hell if she doesn't cooperate. Then when Yuzu, her little sister, declared her love for *Akane*, it made everything that much more hilarious.\n\nI do wonder if the anime will explore slightly more serious ideas on love. They did seem to hint at it with Seiji's chastising of Guri for thinking lightly about love, but, given the high amount of comedy, I'm not going to expect anything too deep.\n\nGreat first episode from RB. :3"
