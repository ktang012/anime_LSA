Each of these walls has 4 little circular extensions with a district within, these are mainly to concentrate human populations in certain areas so they can focus their defenses there since titans are lured towards large populations. Each of these districts has an outer and an inner gate. Note: when I say districts from this point on I'm specifically referring to these districts within the circular extensions on the walls.\n\nEren lived in one of the Wall Maria districts as a child, the Colossal Titan destroyed the outer gate and then the Armored Titan destroyed the inner gate, allowing Wall Maria to be breached. When the Colossal Titan attacked Trost district (one of Wall Rose's 4 districts) only the outer wall was breached, so Wall Rose itself was not breached. However, this time Titans appeared within the Wall Rose area itself, not just within a district. This would mean there was a breach in the wall itself, not a gate. The reason this is a big deal is because it would mean the entire of the Wall Rose area itself was taken over by Titans. Wall Sina's area is much smaller than Rose's, so once again it would mean overcrowding (when Wall Maria was breached they ended up staging an attempt at reclaiming the wall just to reduce the population since there weren't enough resources within Rose and Sina, this would end up being a repeat of that). Unlike the time with Trost, there's also no boulders readily available, so blocking off the wall would be much harder. "

   "text": ">they didn't really die out of stupidity, they were just caught off guard by a foe far more capable than they could've ever anticipated.\n\nI'm not so sure about that... I think they die of stupidity quite often. The first time they are caught off guard, yeah it's unfortunate, but after that you should really be expecting that the titans will do unusual things and account for that variability in your plans. They lose consistently to titans, \"good enough based on what we know\" isn't going to cut it.\n\nThe spear-net devices were a perfect example of a good plan (obviously since Erwin was involved :D). They lured the female titan into a forest without having to engage directly and tried to capture her totally hands off. Even when she foiled that plan by doing something unexpected, they gained lots of valuable knowledge with zero loss to themselves other than a few machines. They learned that boss titans can be lured out at humanities leisure, that they want Eren, they can control smaller titans, they can function with the mental capability and experience of a human, that they can harden themselves on command, that the titan hides among their own soldiers, and most importantly, THAT THEY HAVE MULTIPLE HIDDEN POWERS. Counter to how the anime portrayed it, that mission was a HUGE success even without a captured titan.\n\nThen Levi's squad decides to take all that valuable knowledge gained, mainly the fact that boss titans have MULTIPLE HIDDEN POWERS, and just totally ignore it to throw their lives away. At one point they even slice out her eyes and instead of leaving while shes blinded they decide to battle her head on. Wtf? Did they just completely forget the part where she was immobilized by 50 spears and they still couldn't hit the back of her neck?\n\nThere were only two options in that scenario: Distract and run, or fight and win (gamble). If you intend to win you use everything you have and decimate the enemy, but if you intend to run then don't send your best squad into a direct fight with an enemy of unknown power unless your plan was just to lose them and be a troll. What a waste. Levi/Mikasa/the squad + titanized Eren is a pretty strong front, they would have taken Annie out handily. Of course, they didn't know that at the time and should have just left with what they knew, but had they made the choice to fight in the way any smart tactician would have instead of half assing it they would have a decisive victory as Eren beat the face blinded Annie until it was mush.\n\nAnd Mike? I have no sympathy for Mike. An absolutely giant titan is walking by which he knows all the above information about and his first choice isn't to hide and wait it out? If you whistle out to your horse and have it run directly across a boss titans path you deserve to die. They know these things can think like humans.\n\nZero sympathy.\n\nErwin seems to be the only one who actually learns things. He realized that he needed to isolate Annie within the walls because something will (and did) go wrong with whatever initial plan he thought up. He gave himself room to work around the variability. Logistically speaking, the losses weren't that bad for what they could have potentially gained. It was pretty much all non-military civilians and I doubt any of it was important infrastructure.\n\nDisclaimer: This post was written after rewatching no game no life so it's pretty hyped up over having knowledge over your enemy :)"

I'm always surprised how this show/manga manages to portray the most ridiculous-looking Titans and still giving me such goosebumps. Maybe it's *because* they're looking so freaky.\n* AND HOLY SHIT IT SPOKE. It said \"You know we reside in the nape\", so it seems the big mystery will be which person is the monkey Titan. Let's grab the tinfoil hats, guys!\n* Mike's death was gruesome. And I know I should expect people to die, but it still took me by surprise. I'm so naive *sigh*\n* Also, more Nanaba!

As noted by the characters after the Battle of Trost the Armored Titan never showed because there was suddenly something more important, something they didn't expect. A rouge titan...*Eren*. The outer wall of Trost is what Eren blocked with the giant rock.  \n\nIn Episode 17 I believe they begin the 57th Expedition beyond the walls heading out from Karanes District because due to the giant rock they can no longer leave through Trost. However as you learned through the events of that arc this all was actually a plot to lure out what they believed might be a spy. [Which is why if you remember no one quite knew where Eren was in the position everyone got maps with him in different locations](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/62t0vw/spoilers_shingeki_no_kyojin_season_2_episode_1/dfpose8/) . The Female Titan then appeared and attacked the right flank of the position and eventually they made it into the Forest of Giant Trees or as seen on that map as the \"Titan Forest\". After the failure to capture the Female Titan and the loss of many soldiers the expedition returned to Karanes District. \n\nNot long after while Eren and the Survey Corps were heading to the capital for their failure and the massive loss of life Erwin enacted his plan to lure out who they now believed to be the Female Titan, Annie while they were going through the Stohess District. You know what happens then and Eren and Annie fight in the Stohess District causing massive casualties. Annie loses but not before damaging the outer wall of Stohess in her attempt to escape. This is where the Titan face in the wall shows up. \n\nNot long after the battle with Eren and Annie many members of the 104th are being kept at a outpost not far from the south western edge of Wall Rose and this is where they were for Season 2 Episode 1. The Beast Titan then breaches Wall Rose not too far from the outpost him and several normal Titans are then seen coming in during the episode. Mind you when I'm using words like \"not too far\" thats relative. The size of human territory(including Wall Maria) is about the size of modern France.\n\nThat help at all?"

And now Wall Rose has been breached by this new Beast Titan. \n\nMind you when Wall Maria fell there were so many refugees the government had to send 250,000 of them out in an \"attempt\" to reclaim Wall Maria. Only 100 returned. In actuality this was a culling, there was not enough food, resources and space for all these people and the government intended for them to die. Dot Pixis the Commander of the Southern Garrison Forces confirms this during his speech at the Battle of Trost. However in the very same speech he mentions that if Wall Rose were to fall it would spell the end for humanity as it would create even more refugees than when Wall Maria fell five years earlier with even less space. Civil war would be inevitable and it wouldn't be the Titans that would spell the end for humanity but themselves. *And now Wall Rose has been breached* \n\nFor size references: The distance from Wall Maria to Wall Rose is 100 KM. The distance from Wall Rose to Wall Sina is 130 KM. The distance from Wall Sina to the center is 250 KM. \n\nEDIT:  \n\n> And the first fight in the forest vs the female titan was actually inside wall Maria?\n\nYes. In the map I linked earlier you can see that forest labelled as \"Titan Forest\" \n"

Armin is confused because he was told that Eren was in the front right flank. Jean is confused because he was told Eren was in the left flank.

Really ? Who is next.. Hange ??  \n[AT speculation](/s \"I am still quiet sure that Reiner is the AT and him trying to help Connie escape supports that thought.  \nHe must have understood that they were being observed/held captive because they suspect more undercover Titans like Annie.  \nKnowing that, he obviously wouldn't want to stay there and leave with the first chance he gets.\")  \nI watched as a first timer, taking part in the rewatch and this still seems kinda unreal.  \nI mean watching Season 2 now..

   "text": "Just finished season 1, now onto the main thing. It's weird to think of all the people who would be going \"oh I think I remember him/her\" when everything is so fresh.\n\nI'm impressed with how fast this episode was. Didn't expect them to continue straight on where episode 25 left off, but rather take time with Annie and the situation with the Survey Corps looking for more titan humans hiding amongst them. \n\n**OP**\n\nDidn't like it as much as the first two, but it got beter. The song improves in the second half and the visuals are great all the way through. The tone of the first two wouldn't have worked as this needs to fit an advanced plot. It feels a lot like the campaign has advanced into the open. \n\nLooks like the armoured and giant titan are next targets - no wait, they are their next target. Erwin said so at the end of episode 25. \n\n**OST**\n\nThe new tracks compliment well and it's good that they're using many of the same ones from season 1. They are some of the best pieces of music not only in anime, but in film in general. \n\nThe choir track in the next episode preview sounds good. \n\n**Thoughts**\n\n* So they actually notice the titan in the walls right now? It was right there? Bodes well for the pacing\n\n* Sounds like the Walls Religions lot are either as familiar with titans as the soldiery, or they are in one the reason why it's in the wall. Whichever the case\n\n* Walls guys either know a lot about titans or are in one the secret to why one is in the wall\n\n* Eren's enemy this season is the [armoured titan?](http://i.imgur.com/OzYjl0l.png) Yes please.\n\n* Great to see the only group of competent Military Police guys are back.\n\n* Haji channelling her inner Raguyo Kirurin when she held that guy over the wall\n\n* Suspected that the priest guy had some way to survive when he wanted Hanji to drop him from the wall\n\n* 'Are all the walls made of titans' - exactly what we were theorising during the season 1 rewatch that ended two days ago. \n\n* Reiner has a point. The Survey Corps were pretty stupid to isolate the members of the 104th Training Squad and not assume they would notice anything amiss\n\n* [Photobooth titan](http://i.imgur.com/LQ5hBTY.png?1)\n\n* Surprising Miche lets Connie go to his village\n\n* I've just realised who Miche is - Might Guy from Naruto. Now to rid the picture of Guy going 'Drive out the titans with the power of YOUTH!'\n\n* The heck are those titans doing? Ballet?\n\n* Miche is second in skill to Levi? Way to hype him up... and now he's gone... or not\n\n* Good lord I never thought I'd jump at the sound when Armin burst in\n\n* [Timid sexy titan](http://i.imgur.com/EGMT3iM.png?1)\n\n* [Beast titan](http://i.imgur.com/rxQ9VuJ.png?1) has One Piece like proportions\n\n* The moment the ape titan went for the horse was when horsekind received a grim reminder...\n\n* Another talking titan, huh? Maybe beast titan and the one who worshipped Illse's corpse shared notes. It's interesting to see how it's and Miche's roles have reversed - intelligent to speechless, previously thought speechless to conversing. \n\n* The situation has completely flipped from Miche. He went from being calm and fighting animalistic titans, to becoming animalistic through fear himself when faced with a very gentlemanly titan\n\n* RIP [Miche](http://i.imgur.com/7tyPcv4.png?1). Damn to see him completely losing it in the end\n\n**Theories**\n\nWhat the beast titan says about residing in the nape is undeniable proof that there are a bunch of humans who control titans. He probably took Miche's 3DMG for the use of the human-titans when they're not in titan form.\n\nBeast titan and his team of four, who seem more intelligent than most titans, are fascinating. Are they rogues? Trying to set up their own civilisation? Will they extend the olive branch to the humans or use their intellect to have an advantage on destroying them?\n\nIt looks like titans will use [animals](http://i.imgur.com/q2SpeyU.png), and animalistic qualities to give themselves a big advantage. The human titans, the beast titan and his crew and this smacks of someone leading them behind the scenes.\n\n\n"

Seeing the manga come to life is a new experience for me and it's amazing.\n\n* OP looks fantastic, although I'm a bit confused by those dinosaurs but I guess they serve as metaphors.\n* I can't say I'm already in love with the OP theme. It's really good but it kind of builds and builds and then it's over, without an epic chorus that hypes you up for the episode. Then again, I didn't love Jiyuu no Tsubasa either at first, so I'm positive this one will grow on me.\n* Correct me if I'm wrong but apart from Eren's dream, that EreMika moment wasn't in the manga, right? Either way, I thought it was beautiful and I'm very happy they added it. It's nice to see Eren worry about Mikasa for once, so I appreciated this. Speaking of them, that tag team move they did in the OP was fucking badass.\n* Mike's death was even more horrifying here though, christ.\n* ED is brilliant from a visual standpoint but I'm not really feeling the song just yet. Bit of a shame since I love the first two EDs to death but I guess this one is a good fit for the visuals.\n\nIncredibly excited for next week already. Gonna give this a rewatch or two for sure."

At the start titans were really scary because, hey, fighting them with only humans sounds like a lost fight. Then Eren got Titan, and hey... Eren can pretty much, slowly but surely push these peeps back! Then they gave us \"enemies\" who are also titan shifters, dangerous.

It doesn't capture the scale of the terror that well when the titans appear, especially during the Beast Titan's appearance and the music playing during Mike's battle didn't feel right, the fight itself was kinda underwhelming and didn't really show his skill properly.\n\nThe OP was pretty disappointing sound-wise, but it has some cool visuals (what's up with the animals though) and the ED has some nice foreshadowing and it sounds kind of creepy but I still like both the EDs from the first season way more.\n\nSome weird directing techniques though, not a fan of the whole rewind thing they did and they did this weird rapid cut thing while Mike was getting eaten that was similar to Eren's dream at the beginning of the first season. Didn't really like that either.\n\nThe visual quality of the show seems to have increased, there's less drawing errors this time around than there were in the first season and the thick outlines are toned back a bit.\n\nDisappointing in some aspects, great in others.

On the other hand, my relationship with the franchise has been kind of like a marriage to someone I care for less and less with each new development. I'm hopeful that seeing everything in animation can rekindle that passion.\n\nThe episode looked gorgeous!\n\nThe opening was not all that great in my opinion, especially with what we had gotten last season. The ending song was nothing impressive, but the ending itself was... well... read the manga.\n\nAll in all, very good start to this new season. I wonder how far the anime will go this season? I'm expecting it to get to episode 70-75 of the manga. Which means we're pretty far ahead even now, and likely will be at chapter 100 by time this season ends."

During this time, it was discovered that by having children eat the flesh of the gods, they could absorb some of their power and become god-like creatures themselves.  This ability would be passed down from generation to generation.  However, most weren't able to control this and became mindless beasts that just ran around, trying to kill all people.  So the church exiled them.  The ones that were only partially able to control the ability become the abnormals who look weird and behave strangely.  The larger abnormals that could control their movement and biological abilities (hardening of their skin, growing larger to do things like kick in the walls, etc...), we taken in by the church, trained, and would generally act as shepherds of the failures in exile.  Eventually, some of the shepherds had had enough and wanted to take back their place, leading to a war and the current situation.  Most likely the wall titans are either former leaders of a previous revolt, or volunteers that gave up their bodies to help form the wall."

The ONE tried to ignore the commands (showing that yeti titan doesn't have nearly as much control as it thinks it does) and got squashed for it. The other 2 waited around until Miche screamed in anger. Then for SOME fucked reasoning decided to start nibbling at him. Leaving him to scream in pain for much longer than was necessary to get the point across. Titans have NEVER nibbled at someone like this before. They take big bites out of people or swallow them whole. Even the tiny one was trying to fit as much of Miche in his mouth as he could, as fast as he could. The other two were much larger and would have eaten him in a bite MAYBE two. Not letting him scream in pain and terror as long as he did. They extended this scene to try and ad a level of horror/brutality to the scene that was not needed or justified. It was stupid. It shows the glaring inconsistencies the writer and the series has. That depend SOLELY on the blind fan-aticism of idiots like you. Go back to tumblr."

It's ~edgy~ and gory and kind of like the Game of Thrones of anime ^I ^guess? in that it seems that almost no character is safe from death. Also it's very popular. \n\nI guess to return to my first question\n\n>> They extended this scene to try and ad a level of horror/brutality to the scene that was not needed or justified. \n\nI don't really understand what, in your mind, would qualify as \"justified\" horror/brutality.

No reason = dumb/poor writing\n\nIf this was an Anime like Nanbaka that runs off goofy shit not making sense. I'd be ok with it. But AoT Isn't an anime like that. The moment was meant to be horrifying. But it just ends up being stupid because of the sudden change in actions JUST for this moment. \n\nI'm watching an Anime classified as an \"Action, Drama, Fantasy\" Season one WAS pretty looking. It was also really boring. The main character has no personality beyond REVENGE! because titans are his trigger. It tries SO friggin hard to be edgy that it just comes off as sad. It's not game of thrones at all. Terraformars is far more games of thrones than AoT could ever hope to be. AoT still has main character immunity and close friends immunity. Proof being that Armin is still alive. Any of the other \"Friends\" that have died you barely get a name out of them. Let alone any interaction between them and Ehrin. \n\nI 100% can tell that you don't understand what I'm talking about. That is very VERY prevalent. I'm not talking about gore. I've seen an anime where an elementary girl was stabbed in the eye (100% shown NO censoring) and I was ok with that. Because it makes SENSE in the narrative. It follows the characters and the world that is built around it. It's good writing. Think of it like this. If Jason Voorhees suddenly switched his MO. There would be questions. Why is he doing this? Why is he going from a slasher to taking his time to torture his victims? Does it make sense in the story? Or is it done just so they can get the torture boner going for the twisted people? Or is it just bad, inconsistent writing/directing? AoT it's the latter option.\n\nThat scene should have played out like this. Miche gets his courage back. Grabs his sword and yells. 3 titans activate. He has enough time to start to scream But is suddenly cut off when 3 mouths that could cut him in half bite into him. Severing him several pieces. Killing him. He wouldn't even have enough time to get a Wilhelm scream out Instead we get literally 30 seconds of titans apparently nibbling. WHY!? Literally no reason. \n\nYou act just like every other fan in the series. I basically expect shitty behaviour and ignorance from fan-atics. At least you put yourself above it all (though not by much) and are trying to understand WHY someone might have an issue. Now that I've called you out. "

Though I am impressed they've stuck to their guns and kept filling their episodes with almost nothing to advance the plot. \n\nEDIT cuz a couple more thoughts:\n\nI'm astounded the writers expected me to remember those side characters when they're all so very forgettable. And jesus I'm all for a dialogue driven series but when the dialogue does nothing for the plot or the characters you may as well devote that wasted time to some decent action. And the only decent action this episode was driven laughably over the top by the scene of \"forgettable side character #27\" being eaten. The level of try hard that was to be edgy and disturbing was actually silly. That scene could have had some punch if I had been given any reason to care about forgettable side character #27, but I had none. All in all this episode wasted 90% of it's time, but at least that makes this series consistent. Also the Beast Titan is downright hilarious to look at so at least that was entertaining, though probably not in the way it was intended to be.\n\nMaybe it's just me, maybe I'm the problem and not the series, because I've never understood the hype for AoT. But I keep thinking \"if it's this popular there has to be something to it! I'll stick with it a little longer!\" and am consistently disappointed. I'll give AoT season 2 a few more episodes before I stop wasting my time and leave it for the people who actually enjoy it for whatever reason. "

   "text": "Super jarring CGI and a flashback I didn't care for at all, but other than that a really solid episode. Maybe not as impactful as Season 1 Episode 1 (except for the final scene, because holy shit), but it's nice that we pick up right where we left off.\n\nAs someone who read some of the manga then dropped it, I'm still very skeptical about how this season is going to progress. At one point the manga slowed to a snail's pace if you put the snail in a bear trap. Such a mess of backstories and flashbacks and whatnot and no real plot progression, and an progression we got was super difficult to understand during the first read. By now there's probably a shit ton of ground to cover, and there's no way to comfortably cover all of it in 24 episodes, if you ask me (unless the political jargon is cut short and simplified a bit, but then it might lose its hold on the story).\n\nHonestly, the reason I dropped the manga was because it got so far outside of its core that it became super boring. Like, it's called \"Attack on Titan\" (roughly), yet it strayed so far away from attacking Titans that it didn't feel like SnK anymore. If this episode is any indication of how the rest of the season will go, we should be in for some excitement, but I'm expecting a LOT of downtime towards the mid-season. I hope there's a way to blast through the uber-boring bits of the story so that we continue to be on the edge of our seats every Saturday.\n\nUntil next week, my dudes."

I don't wanna go too much into spoiler territory because I have no idea how to hide spoilers on this website but the politics of the universe really disinterested me in the whole thing. Plus I swear there was a long string of chapters devoted to fleshing out specific characters and after a while I was like \"okay, if the story is gonna take a 4 month halt so we can get a bunch of backstories then I'm gonna shut down.\" And so I did. Idk if it ever got better lmao do we even know what's in the basement after all this time?"
