What you get instead is one page of our heroine looking down from atop the tower with 0 lead-in to that... and then the introduction of Zouroku hanging out with the gangsters.  You also get at the very first meeting his \u66f2\u304c\u3063\u305f\u3053\u3068\u304c\u5927\u5acc\u3044, which forms the basis of his character.  And the paneling is very clean, non-frenetic, quiet in Zouroku's way.  \n\nWhich is to say that the emphasis of the series from the very get-go isn't on the fantastical elements of the show but on the more human elements.  And it's this dynamic that the series continually tugs on.  The very trite, very endearingly human within the fantastic.  \n\nFlipping that around completely changes your framing of the show.\n\n- - - \n\nIt's also important to note that many of the clues we're given in the opening chase scene about characters, about even the existence of some of the major players at work here aren't given until volumes into the series.  Alice to Zouroku is very much the gradual unveiling of the world, the gradual unveiling of who our heroine is, ... etc.  Mystery is very much an element of what's going on and why later revelations are so meaningful. \n\nThe implications here are a few:\n\n1) Hand holding. \n\n2) The mystery element won't be developed much.  Surprise.\n\n3) The anime won't cover enough material and won't get a second season, thus the need for revealing mysterious elements that would otherwise be left incomplete.\n\n- - - \n\nWhen Seven Seas releases their translation, go check out the differences in plot and focus.  You'll likely be completely surprised."

   "text": "> Alice to Zouroku - Episode 1 discussion\n\nThe reveal that he is a florist caught me off guard! Almost to an emotional sense.\n\nBased off his gruff attitude, dealings with the yakuza, and his stern way of parenting, we were led to believe that he is a tough old man. So, when we see this contrasting quality of his, it not only rounds out his character but also highlights further his kind (albeit direct) personality.\n\nWhile the CG is a problem, I'm more interested in how the anime will explain away the mass surveillance. From what we were given, the evil research facility seems to have complete control over all manner of cameras, meaning it should be relatively simple to track her down immediately (especially if she keeps wearing her pink princess dress). Something as simple as her being able to mask her presence to everyone but Zouroku would be enough, but, until then, it'll be a semi-plot-convenience that we'll have to accept.\n\nAlso, Zouroku has taken this development perhaps a *bit* too in stride. Even when Sana first teleported, he was hardly fazed. Not to mention how the whole car chase, with the various magics flying around, didn't seem all that odd to him. That could mean he's either experienced similar events before (which I don't think likely) or it's just that he is hard to surprise (which I think most likely but still seems as if he should have had more of a reaction).\n\nOtherwise, I like it! Sana and Zouroku are at a good starting point relationship-wise, and hopefully the anime focuses on it moving forward. We still need more on their individual characters as well as that mysterious research facility, and it's hard to say how the plot will proceed from here (since it's going to be tough for Zouroku to *really* help out with Sana's wish of destroying the facility). But these details should surface throughout the season.\n\nAnd a shout-out to the creators for giving us a forty-minute-long episode! :3"

   "text": "There's two main aspects of this series that come glaring through from this episode, one of which I hate, and one of which I *loved*. Let's start off with the good.\n\nI think the biggest attraction of this show for me so far and the reason those 40 minutes breezed by was definitely the interaction between our two main characters; Sana and Zouroku. Both of them have clear and charming personalities that interact and contrast with each other nicely. The dialogue between the two is great, and the show really manages to have a heartwarming side quite well like the scene with the flowers, or a meaningful side like the conversation on the staircase. The interaction between Sana and Zouroku is charming and natural, which really stood out this episode as each scene with just the two of them was really fun to watch.\n\nHowever, I strongly dislike the greater narrative that this show is building. I'm bothered by the mystery behind Sana's powers and who she is, but rather the way the facility is constantly chasing and battling her. The 'bad guys' of the series are really bothersome as the way they're handled isn't very appealing. They're rather standard institute suit and tie baddies with little to no originality to them. I'm not a fan of the Sci-Fi human superpower testing facility trope and it's not done well here. Baddies are characterless industry sunglasses like I said before and don't have any real personality or feeling to them that makes them stand out as anything other than 'the baddies'. I also didn't care for the fight scene in the beginning of the episode and the whole institute SciFi aspect of this show is killing it for me. The powers were handled poorly, the twins are pretty standard 'superhumans the baddies use' and overall the thriller SciFi aspect of the show wasn't done very well. \n\nThe character story between Sana and Zouroku is done really well and I love watching it, but I hate the institute-y bad guys greater narrative of the series. My enjoyment will heavily depend on which of these becomes the bigger focus in this show: Will it be a character story, or a mystery thriller? Only time will tell."

The institute has too big a presence to reasonably fade into the background now, but they're really only useful as the framing device for the show's selling points: (a) Sana and Zouroku's interactions, and (b) gruff grandpa dealing with a standard shounen plot. Both of those have real potential. But the institute is being played completely straight and seriously, which so far doesn't seem like the best way to bring out the show's strengths, and only time will tell if they can make it work.\n\nIf the show manages to give real depth to the institute later, I might come to enjoy that aspect too, but I'm not expecting it. Hopefully the sci-fi plot won't come to compete with the good parts of the show."

But I'm willing to stick with it for the time being and see how it pans out. Zouroku's character has me intrigued so I'm curious to see what sort of role he's going to play in the scheme of things. "

While they seem generic at first, a few things they did could widen them into a more rounded group.\n\nThe first big thing is the shot of wonderland we saw. Visually speaking, it was a wonderland. While they did control how much food Sana had to control her powers, from the scale of what wonderland was, it would seem that as long as you work for them, they let you run free mostly, using powers as you see fit. \n\nAs well, how they traveled with the drawing kid at the beginning, while they did need his power to fix the bridge. They had a limousine just to transport him and the girls, and the guy did seem apologetic that he did have to wake him up so early.\n\nIt may seem like they are generic government lab baddies right now, but I get the feeling that they are not treating the children as badly as it first seems. This could fit into an arc about Sana growing out of wanting to destroy the facility, as we learn that it isn't some cruel place where they torture the children to use their powers, as is often the case in these institute bad guy narratives."

Great mix of comedy, drama, action and some sweet moments, and the music was spot on as well. The Alice's dream power has already given us some really nice, creative action scenes so I'm looking forward to what else we'll see in future episodes in that department. \n\nI already love Zouroku's character, the kindly, yet gruff old man, he's so fucking cool, and the way he gave all the girls a punch in the head after they caused all that trouble, coupled with their confused and sad reactions was hilarious. The fact that he's a florist also somehow makes him more cool? I don't understand, but I like. \n\nIt's a real shame about the shoddy CGI (there was one moment when the car was stopped, but the scenery was still flying by outside the windows, lol), because the 2D art is great. The shot where Sana walked into the room full of flowers was outright beautiful. And the character designs are also very very nice to look at, even if their mouths are a bit low and look a little goofy. \n\nAnd that ED! Absolutely gorgeous! Lovely song, the same one from one of the PVs, and the paint style art was fantastic as well.\n\nHonestly, this is the best premiere I've seen so far this season, even better than Boku no Hero Academia and Shingeki no Kyojin, and that's saying something, especially after that SnK episode. I think I'm having a moment, honestly, this was amazing. I did the Wallace hand thing ([this](https://media.giphy.com/media/z7WDgVoPhLo7S/giphy.gif)) at least once during that episode and I'm not afraid to admit it. "

Doesn't mean much but still worth noting, especially with the foreign cars on display.\n\n* The kid with sketchbook has his ability shown exactly what it can do and at no point is it stated or shown directly, I quite like that.\n\n* It would seem the old guy lost his son or daughter and is caring for his granddaughter because of it, once again the exchange that makes this apparent is really well done because it keeps the subtlety of it.\n\n* I like Sana's character, she has a good balance to her, and this means the interactions she shares are able to be created fluidly, rather than her specific personality pushing the conversation.\n\n* Calling it now... shop clerk is best girl.\n\n* I like that ED, that's a nice ED.\n\n---\n\nOverall thoughts are mixed, I really like the story and think from a narrative and structure point of view it works really well. The characters are fun to watch, the premise is interesting and the set up has already created the necessary intrigue to get me interested in the long haul. On the other side the animation really lets it down, even when it's not a CG bloodbath there isn't anything to write home about. I wouldn't even say the directing is all that great, the layouts and composition was especially average.\n\nAll in all, this has definitely got me interested in the story and I will watch more, in fact there is nothing telling me in this episode that I will have any need to drop this... but I don't know if it will stop me griping about the animation."

Even a powerful institute like theirs has resource limitations, otherwise that woman at the beginning wouldn't be complaining that she couldn't get the computer thing she asked for. So they don't pour in a lot of resources into everything that might potentially have some benefit. Since they have multiple Dreams of Alice, it's fine for her to specialise, because if they need to get something done that she can't do, they'll call on someone else.\n\nIt also doesn't look like they bothered deliberately shaping anyone's imagination much since their go-to example was giving children some fantasy books and letting them develop on their own. Besides that, the adults are aware that powerful children are dangerous, so an overly powerful individual is not only an amazing test subject, but also a major threat. So it's easier for the institute to control her if her limitations are entirely predictable, on the off-chance she goes rogue.\n\nA potential reasonable limitation would be that the object with a chain would need the chain to be part of its normal function, and it would have to actually be functional. That would explain why her created objects are so mundane... and why she can't just create any object with a chain sticking out of it. So if they wanted to make up an object with a chain that doesn't exist, they'd essentially have to design and invent it such that it does exist. This isn't necessarily worth it if their goal isn't specifically to maximise her potential as an asset."

It later evolved to an ecchi fest, with like 70 chapters mushed into two episodes. Making the ending utter garbage filled with dues es machina, important characters who the viewers don't even know or understand the goals of, powers that make no sense, and so on. I could make a longer list but there's really no point, in short, it was a train-wreck. \n\nRegardless, the premise stuck, and idea of the show was extremely intriguing to me. I obsessed over it, but still never read the manga in fear of more disappointment. \n\nThis anime has an *extremely* similar premise, and so it's giving that premise another chance. I don't know anything about this anime other than the first episode I just watched. But I *loved* it, if this runs well, it's gonna scratch and long ass itch, and probably become one of my favorite anime of all time. \n\nI am **extremely** excited for the future of this series."

If they can fix the standard animation errors and avoid using too much CGI I can see myself finishing this.\n\nThey need to expand on the villains/bad guys, however. At the moment they're utterly uninteresting and the entire Wonderland/science lab subplot is not very well done (for example, are they going to consistently pull shit like \"use government/city cameras\" every episode? I sure hope not).\n\nIt's not as relaxing as I was hoping it would be, but it has potential. Here's hoping."

Like there wasn't any tension or urgency about anything.\n\nSo we have this high-tech research facility who know all about the girl's power but, apparently, had no means of subduing her. She walks slowly through a forest nearby and apparently this super organisation has no means of capturing her then. They send four cars and one power user. They track the girl down to the city but apparently couldn't find her even though she spent three hours squatting in a convenience store. There's this big car chase and apparently no one else in the city could give a damn. \n\nI just had trouble suspending my disbelief for this one. I'm supposed to believe this girl is in genuine danger and needs help, but can't. Coupled with stiff animation and horrific use of CG, I couldn't bring myself to finish the episode. A shame since the whole dynamic between the old man and the girl seems interesting. "

That's all a worry for later however.\n\nMy other main complains are mostly that the animation sometimes is a bit wobbly like in the car scenes and some conversations.\n\nHowever past that we got an amazing premise with a very unusual protagonist. If seen a lot of requests on this sub for anime with more mature characters and very often there aren't many recommendations in those threads. Thats why im glad to see someone like Zoroku. The way he just accepts reality almost immediately and deals with Sana in such a mature way is great to see.\n\nI can't wait to see where this show is gonna go next and I hope that it gets popular so that writers get more interested in changing up their protagonists to cover more different types of people."

   "text": "Okay, I have some pretty mixed feelings about this one.   \nFirst of all, the base premise is generic as hell. Some mysterious facility experimenting on kids with superpowers, and one of them escapes and zzzzzzz... Luckily, the old guy was there to provide a totally unique perspective on the whole thing. He's old, he's grumpy, and he's not taking shit from any of this bullshit sci-fi premise. If the show can focus on him and his reactions to everything, rather than the cliches of everything else about the story, we might be in for a good time.\n\nAlso another thing that separates this from your generic kids-with-superpowers plot is that there's a lot of focus on the systems surrounding the plot, instead of the actual plot itself. The chase scene at the start, for example, was shown almost entirely through background characters looking at screens. We were shown how the research facility functioned, and how they went about trying to recover an escaped specimen, instead of focusing on the girl herself. The same thing happened at the police station, and when we were shown the photos being deleted from everyone's phones. The show seems to be going out of its way to show us how the plot is affecting the people and the environment around them. Which is actually pretty interesting.\n\nOne obvious downside of that is, that it was really hard to care about Sana herself. I wasn't sure who I was supposed to be rooting for during the chase scene, because there was nothing to make me care about the escaped girl herself. We didn't know her name or anything about her, except for the fact that she's a cute anime girl, and we barely even saw her face. Why should I be rooting for her to succeed? For the rest of the episode as well, she's shown to be bratty and demanding, and not much else. Why exactly are we supposed to care about her, other than the fact that she's an important character?\n\nThe CGI sucked, as I'm sure everyone is aware, but I also wanted to mention the character designs, which look completely out of place in the sort of story the show seems to be going for. Everyone looks like a character from some 4-koma comedy manga, bringing to mind shows like Yuyushiki or Nichijou, and it makes it hard to take the action scenes seriously when everyone look like they're about to slip on a banana peel or some other stupid shit.\n\nAlso, did anyone else experience some awful sound quality? The version I watched was just atrocious. I'm sure it's not the shows fault, just whoever encoded the video I saw."

Loved the ED.\n\nThe research facility seems to have really brainwashed the other kids into thinking they really don't belong in the outside world. I have a feeling this anime will make me rage a lot at the research facility personnel, and me strongly disliking experimentation on living things in general doesn't help.\n\nWent into this with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't expect to like this anime so much because the first 10 - 15 minutes didn't really do much for me. By the end of the episode I was loving it though. The interactions between Sana and Zoroku in particular.\n\nMinor drawback was the dreadful CGI. Will never understand why it's becoming such a big thing. Lower costs maybe? I dunno.\n\nAnyway, great start for this anime."
