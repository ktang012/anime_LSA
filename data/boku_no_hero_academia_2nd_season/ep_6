If you remember from episode 3, it showed him attending school while he was still cleaning up the beach. \n\nThe Japanese school year is different from ours. We have 2 terms, or semesters, one that starts in the fall and one that starts in the spring. The Japanese school year has 3 terms, or trimesters. The first starts in the spring in April and lasts until late July. Then they have 5-6 weeks of summer vacation and they return for the second term in September, which lasts until just before Christmas. Then they get a couple weeks off before starting the third term in January which lasts until March. \n\nSo Deku started his 10 months of training in May of his 9th grade year which was his last middle school year. He turned 15 in July while he was doing his training. Right after turning 15, the first term ended and he did summer vacation. He likely did a ton of extra hours cleaning up the beach during this time. Then he kept up with his training throughout his second and third terms before the UA entrance exam which happened in March at the end of the school year. Then he got accepted into UA and began classes in April which was the start of his 10th grade year, which is the first year of Japanese high school.\n\nWe're not sure how much time has passed but there are some future events coming up if you've read the manga that help establish the timeline a bit better. For example, they have an end of term exam which takes place at the end of the first term, which we know is late July. So I'm estimating the sports festival to be somewhere around May based on what we've seen so far and what's coming up in the manga. "

We saw 5 fights, and prepared a 6th, whilst cementing Uraraka's character and determination to succeed, in the face of an explosive battle with Bakugou. It also reiterate the point, tied to world building, that in MHA, some heroes can be friends...but all heroes are rivals. It's a business, after all! \n\nAs for the 5 first round fights covered in this episode? They were all inventive, with different climaxes to each, and they each managed to show off the personalities of the participants well. On top of that though, they showed off another series message: not all men are born equal. Some of these heroes have flexible quirks, while others have situational. Take Momo, for example. She has an incredible quirk, with Creation, and with split-second decision-making, it can be powerful in the realm of one-on-one combat. But she's a kid with self-confidence issues, and it shows! In a team exercise, she's probably the most adaptable person in the class. And in academics, she's probably the most intelligent. But book smarts don't always translate to field strategy, and without that decision-making, she was simply outclassed. But after the match, you can see her frustration and anguish. This only sets up further character development down the road...and for a supposed side character no less! That's good content, in my mind. There's other aspects, but I won't drone on for ever and bore you with those. Hope that maybe persuades you to think differently about this episode, but if not, oh well. Each to their own, after all! I'm sure the coming episodes won't be 'disappointing' in any way though, so that's always a bonus :P "

Some people are stronger than others, and often through teamwork they can overcome that difference in strength. But in one-on-one matches? There's nowhere to hide. The strong almost always prevail. And in this world, people don't have power-sets, they just have a power. So if they're matched-up against an opponent who has an advantage against them, then they're just likely to lose, and I like the realism there. In shonen, the mangaka often force upsets, rather than writing them cleverly. Horikoshi doesn't fall into such traps, and I applaud him for that, personally.\n\nOf course there are closer matches to come, but those are between the more powerful students, where there are few quirk advantages. While in most shonen series, all of the cast want to just be stronger at fighting, in MHA, a hero doesn't have to be strong at fighting. A hero is far more than just defeating heroes. As such, in a tournament like this, its only natural that the battle oriented heroes-in-training sweep the others, who may be more rescue-inclined. Then again, that's my opinion, anyway."

Although you could make the case that flying through a thundercloud is a really fucking bad idea. Meanwhile, \"Ground types just send the electricity to the ground\" means \"It is easy to run an electrical current through their body\" Meaning they should be weak to electric type attacks, not freaking immune.\n\nIn the case of Kaminari's fight, his opponent still should have gotten zapped due to ground current. By ground current, I mean the same way that lightning kills most people: not by striking them directly, but from current running throught the ground away from the striking point, and using a person's legs as a shortcut because the ground has electrical traffic congestion."

Heroes may have gadgets to help and their costumes are designed to enhance their quirks and cover their weaknesses, but it's all only ever supplementary. Meanwhile Hatsume's tech allowed her to dance circles around Iida *while he was being assisted by her gadgets* despite her quirk being completely meaningless for the fight. Give a smart pro hero with a good quirk enough of those gadgets and they'd become an absolute monster. Hell, half of her stuff demonstrated there could outclass plenty of more mundane quirks. I'm sure she could build something to bolster strength to superhuman levels, or create a massive electrostatic discharger to mimic Kaminari's quirk.\n\nThe closest we've seen to a hero that doesn't use his quirk to fight is Eraserhead. He effectively turns every fight into a quirkless vs. quirkless battle and he sweeps the floor with them through superior technique and his binding scarf weapon. You'd think he would be the perfect candidate for Batman-level gadgets, but he just has his scarf."

   "text": "Going along with this line of thinking, I never really felt Ironman's worldbuilding on a believeable/immersive level. In real life, the key word is specialization. You have to specialise. There is the person who makes the machine, the engineer. There is the person who uses the machine, the fighter. Now, seeing as they both have the same limited resourse that is time, they both invested it into building and fighting respectively. The result is an elite engineer, who built a bad ass machine, that the elite fighter can fight with to the limits of performance, because he dedicated his life training for it. This theme is seen recurring everywhere in life. This is why I don't feel Ironman. If they wanna be realistic, any fighter pilot or random marine who is taught to operate a suit, should exponentially outperform Tony, and Tony shoild be nowhere near the limits of the machine like we see him do. In the same way, by now, many companies should be pumping out superior suits to tony's.  \n    \n  BnHA does it so right, which is why it feels so immersive. You get a sense that everyone has a role, and is suited for that role. With this in mind, someone as skilled in inventing wont have anything on the combat specialist in fighting, and wouldn't even think of a competition on that front. That is how they got that good at building in the first place. When babymama sees Lida, what she is thinking is along the lines of 'hmm... the short exhaust systems overheat too quickly, which might be causing a loss of power due to premature combustion from the heat. How could I improve the thermal efficiency of those systems?...': That is an elite engineer's mindset. Rather than 'whenever he is about to start running, he inhales sharply, and is faster approaching from my left, as he is right handed, so his stronger side would be powering the turn...': Which is an elite fighter's mindset. At the competitive level, everyone is specialised like that. You can't be both as top level at inventing world-ending level shit and then better than the 100% fighters at using your shit to win fights, even though you made it. Its not possible. This is the real reason why Onii-sama in Mahouka is one hell of a broken character, but the way they built that world, that's the point, so it fits.  \n    \n  Mei being able to just pump out a gadget for any situation/opponent would be the definition of asspulls galore, because its far from possible, even in this world's setting. It would be past even impossible, for her to somehow construct ONE gadget that will be able to put down *everyone*. As in everyone of those beasts with ridiculously powerful and diverse quirks who have investing as much time in combat, and using that quirk to take down an opponent as mei has in invention; like your comment infers. That would be ridiculously steaming shit, and I'm grateful that the anime dosen't fuck around like that. By the way, I hope you don't think Mei is quirkless... you don't get into UA if you are quirkless. "

He also compulsively researches other people's quirks and tries to come up with countermeasures for them. He has even come up countermeasures for all the students in the class, like he's Batman and this is the Justice League. In other words, except for the fact that he can't control his quirk without crippling himself yet, Deku looks like he's going to be become some unholy combination of Batman and Superman.\n\nDeku is terrifying."

   "text": "Really liked how they showed each fight even if it was short with each fight being different most being comical, but also giving insight of the characters.\n***\n***Kaminari vs Ibara (Quirk Reveal)***: Mostly showing off their personality, however its obvious both quirks are powerful. While Kaminari is very effective against some (Tokoyami is the first example) it can be nullified by others. Ibara is pure goddess....I can't wait to see her angry though!\n\n***Iida vs Mei (Quirk Reveal)***: Like most of the other fights very comical. Its really a nice layout for Mei as a character and of course more Iida humor.\n***\n***Ashido vs Aoyama***: Funny fight actually laughed out loud at the underpants. I'm glad they added the goofy knockout sound for Aoyama otherwise I would of just felt bad for the guy for the embarrassing moment. Pretty much what we get from this fight is Ashido is agile and physically strong which makes her quirk more dangerous. Aoyama honestly could have a very good ranged quirk, but he has a long way to go. Also needs to learn how to physically fight.\n\n***Tokoyami vs Momo***: The least humorous of the fights. While Tokoyami and Kaminari are totally different people their quirks are similar in that if they have a advantage they are extremely powerful and incredibly hard to defeat, but what they really need to work on is how to deal with situations where their quirks suffer. With Kaminari out Tokoyami chances have increased tremendously. Momo performance was disappointing at best. She has a quirk that is really whatever she can imagine. She is the smartest student in class A. Yet she failed. You can see the sadness in her eyes not that she lost, but that she did nothing. Compare that to the other recommended student in the class Todoroki and you can see how different their performance was. Character progression is starting here with a lot of the side characters if you haven't noticed yet.\n\n***Kirishima vs Tetsu x 4***: The whole rivalry has been hilarious, but their fight is a straight up brawl and as the other pro heroes say their passion shines through. These are two of my favorite characters. Simple powers but effective and their general attitude and demeanor makes these two fun to watch and easy to root for. \n\nI'm really glad they took the time to show the fights even if they weren't long fights, because the fights are really a good intro to the characters that we had some idea about and where future arcs could take them."

I mean, shit, that's almost a more interesting plotline than the actual plot of BnHA, haha.\n\nAlso Darkwing Duck Sasuke continues to prove that **DAT AINT FALCO** and not only overwhelm who I previously had pegged as the second most capable member of their class (only behind Todoroki in sheer ability, but if you consider all-around intelligence, flexibility, etc. she's been my #1), he did it intentionally only aiming for her shield and going out of his way not to hurt anybody (which I suspect he's been doing this entire time but they just haven't picked up on yet which makes both him and his ~~stand~~quirk even more badass).\n\n\nI just want to again reiterate that I went out of my way to avoid this show in the first season.  I'd been too burnt in recent years by everyone losing their shit over the \"flavor of the month\" show, then watching it later and being disappointed. BnHA is every bit as hype as fuck as people have made it out to be and then some.  I haven't been this excited about and invested in a show since One Piece was in the middle of Enies Lobby while I was in high school."

But making something that would make light would be complex. Even if you went with something simple like say a chemical reaction based flash bang. He didn't give her time enough to consider that.

(simply making something over and over in her head would make the process faster). But she is still young and inexperienced as combat using her power. \n\nIts still strong but someone like Bakugo and Todoroki have huge advantages vs her because their quirks are so naturally part of their fighting style they are just scary good with them in combat. Its kinda like someone who thinks about how a fight will go vs someone that fights using muscle memory. The fighter using muscle memory seems SO much faster because he isn't thinking about what he is doing his body is just instinctively reacting. "
