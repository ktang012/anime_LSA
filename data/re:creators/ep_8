   "text": "Well, the problem with that is that now that he's a real hooman and the universe has to calculate the logic of their world into ours... He's essentially bipolar. Tsundure in anime = Bipolar irl/trauma walls.\n\nIt could easily become a matter of him locking himself in the mecha/refusing to go in out of actual depression/trauma a la Shinji. (I haven't gone past 3 Evangelion episodes yet though, but I remember that whole shit being traumatic af for him, rather than bipolarism like in this kid's case).\n\n**That's what I think they're doing here with showing the effects of these 'caricatures' being translated into the real world. Their extreme personalities have consequences here.** \n\n* Madokaish-san's beat-em up until they turn good essentially makes her a violent vigilante. \n* [Celty](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/85308.jpg)/[King Arthuria-Sama's](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/6/275276.jpg) strict ideals to protect her version of England leads her to be a rash, sacrificial, gullible mess with tyranical PTSD. \n* [Shinji-kun](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/225177.jpg) has the trauma of not wanting to pilot the crazy-ass mech mixed with the generic main character enthusiasm **plus** the 'stop telling me what to do I'm a big kid/i'll prove myself' traits making him into a bipolar mess. When the author is speaking of him you can tell he's still unfinished and not fleshed out as a character. The traits he set forth were meant to later aggregate into a plot-twist/epiphany he hasn't reached yet.\n* [Red King](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/15/189718.jpg)/[Ban](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/8/30608.jpg)/[Renji](https://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/bleach/images/0/01/RenjiEpisode363.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20130727231650&path-prefix=en)/[Shizu-chan](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/5/110552.jpg) on the other hand seems to balance out as a logical rival-type character who has good intentions and is logical, but is merciless and sadistic if you test him. He also seems to be aloof (not realizing he could have just bought himself food), a likely-trope introduced in his story to make him seem less cold and more caring towards his friends even though he's supposed to be a bad guy. So far, my favorite character! Seems to come from a mafia/street-brawling/esper genre.\n* Military Princess (won't go into much detail because my theory might be a spoiler) but she follows the trope of the villain who lost hope in the world and wants to see it destroyed.\n* Old Revolver Dude - Already have a few characters similar to him I can think of, but I'll wait until we know more about him\n* Meteora seems like a [Lelei la Lalena](https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/characters/11/278274.jpg) type. Well adapted, but emotionless. This might become part of her development later on. Maybe having a breakdown or something.\n* Selesia so far seems like the generic protagonist in a political battle anime. No opinion yet.\n* Magane from the intro immediately gives me the vibes of [Roy Mustang](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/cc/fd/9b/ccfd9b69848b5b823ad90fc2f154af99.png) meets [Ougi](http://static.zerochan.net/Oshino.Ougi.full.1938375.jpg) given her intro, she's likely going to be a mysterious character with unknown motives.\n\nThat's all I got so far. They're all based on characters we already know that have made an impact on us. I just wish this was Prime exclusive so more people could enjoy this."

Most of them had it much harder there than here so I think a little change of pace is not doing bad for them.\n\nYou can make an easy example of this with Selesia, after learning she was a character in a story spawned outside of Souta's screen after some moment of confusion she adjusted herself to the fact that she was alive and active, while she doesn't like to see her source material, justifiably so, she doesn't find the need to question her existence.\n\nHaving said this, I don't think we should disregard these altogether. They have already done a similar thing to Mamika where she got horrified and froze up after seeing Selesia get horribly hurt. Last week on /a the fact that government hasn't done anything despite substantial damage and witnesses was an issue brought up by many and both sides were argued a lot. So we should wait and see where they take this issue, but knowing that the focus will be more on the action I'm not seeing this is going to be an issue for a lot of the characters."

I would take this to be a meta commentary by the show on the nature of character development. A character is inconsistent when his motivations and values do not line up with his actions.\n\nHowever, if this interpretation is correct, the lack of any value judgments about it (whether this inconsistency is ultimately good or bad for the character) means that it doesn't really amount to much. Its only purpose would be to highlight the contrivance that the show has created by openly acknowledging its poor writing, which would seem pretty meaningless to me.

In other words it's more likely that main reason for suicide was how whole anime industry functions, which is why Hime despises land of gods and why she can't forgive them. MC probably was working with her on early stages of designing story or character but ultimately didn't notice or helped when Setsuna needed it the most. By Chekhov's gun principle since 1st episode we were fed bits of information about MC leading to him being: a) partly creator of Hime b) being the one who will right everything and resolve situation. Last episode just confirms it in Meteora's words. Captions in last episode don't show much enmity for regular viewers so, just average comments, again, it's more likely that it's more about industry killing Setsuna and not about some simple cyber-bullying."

Trying to read the words in the video description for World Etude, but it's very small. It says something like \"I used to like writing and I was very happy that people supported me. A lot of things have happened. At the mere___, was the start of it. \n\nThis is Shimazaki Setsuna's ___. I suppose there will no longer __.\"\n\nSome of the video comments say \"the uploader's comment is scary ,\" \"what a godly song,\" \"I can't get enough of this setting,\" \"I want her to step on me,\" \"I keep repeating it,\" \"a military uniform and saber,\" \"Hey, what kind of feeling are you feeling\" and there's another comment that talks about antis who bashed her (Setsuna, I'm assuming). \n\nSome of the tags on the video include, Altair, Beginning of a Legend, Godly Song, Shimazaki Setsuna, \u4e8c\u6b21\u5275\u4f5c (which is a derivative work, so in this case it seems it's like a fan spinoff), pigtail princess, military uniform, almost an original character.\n\nIn Setsuna's last post it says \"This is my new work, as I mentioned before, giving a star's name...This is probably the last one. Thank you for loving this character...Good bye.\" \n\nAhhh ok, I think Altair is an OC from Setsuna's work called World Etude which is spun off from the original series called Yuukyuu Taisen Megalosphere (Eternal Great War Megalosphere). And maybe World Etude was a video/song series (?) seeing as it was up on ~not nico nico douga~\n\nWelp that was really unorganized/out of order since I kept going back and forth between scenes trying to read it.\n\nNot exactly sure the connection b/w Setsuna & Souta but it seems that they did interact w/ each other and she had consulted Souta before about wanting to draw (?)\n"

It's a pleasant surprise to see the council come off as competent and well-meaning, and they're shown to have reasonable concerns like costs and the impact on people. They didn't specify anyone getting hurt (except, perhaps, the creator who got kidnapped) so everything must have been limited to property damage thus far.\n\n...I was actually completely able to accept that Meteora just happened to have the magic ability of sending military-grade weapons at people despite seemingly coming from a medieval-esque world but having a sensible explanation works too. Importantly, it means her battle resources are pretty limited, as she only has the machine gun with one cartridge and some hand grenades left, although the council is surely willing to replenish her stock of things that aren't 26M yen each. Anyway, the cost was said as 165M, but 6 missiles at 26M each works out to 156M. Subbing error.\n\nThere have been enough slow episodes that I should probably readjust my expectations to something slower-paced and more cerebral than the action series the premise signals. Especially with Meteora putting the focus on normal people's imaginations as opposed to the creations at the end. And all of the incentives for the heroes are to minimise the battles and their impact on people (although that means the opposite for Gunpuku's team), so only having a few battles is the best way to show they're serious about that. I like that kind of show too, as long as I know that's what I'm watching."

   "text": "I'd say that the leaps of logic are probably part of her character.  It's entirely possible that her entire theory is just wrong, but it's enough to give people a good idea of what *could* be at stake. The basic idea of \"Military girl is up to something big from the way she was talking, we need to stop the flow of more characters entering this world and do some damage control while we figure stuff out\" is pretty sound at this point. Her theory gives more credence to what she believes is the best course of action, whether it's true or not.  \n\nAssuming it's not explicitly true, it kind of reminds me of the way Majora's Mask framed the 3 day timer before you realized the moon was gonna destroy everything: the happy mask man was \"leaving\" in 3 days. It's enough to get you moving while you're still learning the real motivation. As an RPG character, she might have had something similar in her game(which she literally just played before coming up with the theory) to give her an idea like that."

The government being conveniently left out is such a common setting in any story that seeing them actively identify & act upon the situation is refreshing by default."

She feels a lot more balanced; she's very logical and sensible when it comes to planning and acting on the fly, but she also looks like a girl that can let her hair down and have a good time around Selesia & Marine.\n\nSpeaking of designs, Rui Kanoya was also pretty well rounded, a bit defensive & shy, but can also suffer from outbursts and turn into typical shounen pilot. Oh boy, poor Selesia got rejected by a younger boy when she was just trying to calm him down. Speaking of Selesia, it's really great that her creator doesn't think of her as an object or a product of his own creation, but she's recognized as a human being along with all the other creations popping up in this world."

Something like a 'clash of ideals', Fate/Zero style. Mamika failing to redemption-talk Selesia was a brilliant example of this.\n\nAlso it'd be great if the creators could actually figure out how to successfully rewrite characters and influence battles in future episodes.

The director suggested making the Gigas bigger (55 m) in order to emphasize the difference.\n(Basically the Gigas is a little shorter than the Leaning Tower of Pisa, at 56.4m.)\n\n- Hiroe says Rui is a mixture of several characters from mecha shows, including Ikari Shinji.\n\n- When discussing Celesia's character, who had some moments of comedy relief, Hiroe said he wasn't expecting her to do so when he started to write the series. In a sense, he said the character became \"three dimensional\";\n\n- Hiroe purposely wrote the government and the female officer in particular as competent because he felt it was frustrating to have people in power doing idiotic things."

Most likely, Rui has a very shallow personality because of that element as anime only characters tend to not have *as* fully formed designs as those written for light novels or even manga.\n\nThat would also explain why Meteora seems kind of flat: She was essentially an information-fount NPC at the very end of a video game. All the \"characters\" generally seem to have as personality only what they were given by their original creators, which frankly makes the show much more interesting when you start comparing some of their quirks and outlandishness to the \"real people\" characters, who seem to have more complicated emotions and reactions to unfurling events."

   "text": "While this show has a lot of good ideas, the amount of exposition is staggering. It seems that from episode 2, we've simply jumped from exposition scene to exposition scene. I love worldbuilding but it's just \"characters sitting listening the exposition\" the anime. First it was Meteora, now this show tries to \"mix things up a bit\" by adding a new character who adds nothing to the story but exposition.\n\nIt also bothers me how much Meteora seems to know. From early on we're told that Meteora doesn't have any more information than the rest of the cast so she's just guessing what's going on. It's become increasingly clear that she could write a textbook using nothing but her \"guesses\".\n\nThe author of this show is just using Meteora as a plot device to explain things that none of the characters should know. This helps to build some drama since Meteora tells us that there's consequences to not doing anything, listening to her matter-of-factly ramble on for 20 minutes while no one questions whether she could be wrong shows that she's an exposition engine rather than some sort of detective.\n\nIt hurts to see a show with such interested ideas bogged down by lazy writing. _Something_ needs to happen soon if this show is to keep my interest. I'm not asking for non-stop action and explosions, it doesn't even have to be action. I just want this show to go 10 or even 5 minutes without exposition, is that too much to ask for?\n\nTldr: Too much exposition; it's not even good exposition."

I loved how they scolded Meteora about stealing weapons. \n\nOtherwise, Military Princess will finally have her identity revealed. Looking forward to that. Sounds like it was the girl that created her rather than Narrator-kun. "

Then they just 180 and say they're given special status to just live there and believe their story, without any proof. And finally, they're just like, 'hey go off on this train ride and we won't observe you or mandate any control of your potential terrorism.'\n\nEDIT: However, I do have to say that the one thing they're really consistent about is how they handled the money of the missles. \"Total cost is like 150 million yen. You know, with taxpayer money.\" Then they brush it off like it's just: \"Hah, whatever, it's just taxpayer money.\""
