The two factions have plenty of characters to introduce and so far we've gotten a glimpse of almost everyone but one characters in just 4 episodes. I think that's a lot, and it's a good thing MC-kun keeps his mouth shut to allow the creations to tell their stories.  \n\nYeah, I agree. I can understand why some might be tired of Meteora's exposition, even though I like it myself, but I don't get why people think Souta needs to \"do something\". We've been given obvious hints that he'll be important later and, as you said, there are plenty of other characters to follow in the meantime.  \n\nEven calling him the \"MC\" might be misleading. Yes, Souta is definitely the *de facto* MC, but there's a reason why he describes himself as the \"narrator\" and not the \"main character\". That makes it pretty clear that we shouldn't expect the plot to revolve around him all the time.  \n\n> I liked the huge contrast between Selecia and Mamika, one feels incredibly embarased when she sees herself in all kinds of advertising. And the other one instead of doing some thoughtful grocery purchases, she gets every single item with her face printed on it.  \n\nI really want to see that scene in the ED where Celestia and Meteora meet cosplayers. Probably not going to happen, but here's hoping.  \n\n> We still need to know wich side will Mirokouji choose, or if he'll just be partially neutral and jump in to aid whom he thinks needs it most when the time calls.  \n\nI think he'll definitely fall on the heroes' side, based on his interactions so far and artwork that shows him together with the protagonists, but I don't know if he'll start hanging around with them yet.

Which usually leads into loads of viewers asking really basic questions concerning the plot or world. The two different types of shows are simply paced differently.\n\nAt the same time, shows that are longer but don't have *any* exposition (i.e. SnK) tend to be massively popular because of the \"mystery\" behind all the action as little bits and pieces are thrown out over extremely long periods of time. SnK's entire first season literally boiled down to one or two major plot developments and then went on hiatus for years with people breaking down over how little happened and was explained.\n\nThen you have this show, which infodumps for literally one episode, and you have people bitching about it. All it boils down to is that you can't please everybody, but have to try and find some way of finding a middle ground. Especially since this is an anime original with *nothing* for LN or manga readers to spoil. You've got to do *something* concerning what's going on, and putting it all into one episode instead of stringing it along and having people forget shit is, from a directorial standpoint, a much better option.\n\nI mean, people are already forgetting what has happened in the first three episodes *already*, and what I'm getting is that having the framework explained in *one* episode is bad?

In short, rules of time and space bending around \"immigrants from the imagination\" would probably not tear the universe apart but rather exert pressure on it together, and cause it to mutate into World of TV Tropes, where narrative causality is in effect, million-to-one chances always succeed, and forces of good consistently prevail.

Because the main setting is the real world, I don't want to regard it with logic like \"well, since it's a story, it'll probably turn out that way\", but Gunpuku proved that logic right. Maybe that's one of an exposition-chan's special abilities.\n\nI was pleased when Meteora played her own video game, but wow, is her game so short that she can play it in one day? The way she described it, I can't imagine her doing a speedrun, but I'm not used to games with <20 hours playtime... well, if she started in the afternoon and ended not long before dinner the next day, maybe it's around that time. If it's a video game then I assume it's a completed story, which means it's natural for her to have different priorities from everyone else, disposition aside. There isn't anything in particular to worry about for her world's future, so she can evaluate her game as a piece of art or as an experience.\n\nOn Gunpuku's side most of it wasn't unexpected, other than Mamika listening in on Gunpuku's speech about destroying this world to save others. I'd thought she'd remain ignorant or something for a while longer because it felt like such a bad guy speech, going by the kind of logic I'd expect a magical girl to be used to. Perhaps she just takes it as a given that she's starting out in the right and that everything will turn out okay somehow without hurting people, but Gunpuku's speech was pretty direct about it. I imagine Mamika will try to make rationalisations for a while, but the world has already proven it won't be so kind to her worldview."

I don't want to say she is badly written, she just have a different mindset, probably because of the kind of story she is from.\n\nMeteora binge-played her own game, that was interesting from her, it sure helped her to trust her (unfortunately RIP) creator.\n\nThe way the AlicexMamika scene developed showed a lot about themselves and I think even the whole \"not being able to remember names correctly\" is also part of Mamika's character (that and she just went and bought her own merchandising, lol).

Like the other reply said, there's no 100% ironclad rules, but usually (and seemingly in this case) names in katakana (such as Selesia's) are foreign, and are meant to be \"translated\" instead of just \"romanized.\"  As a quick example, Alicetaria's last name (\u30d5\u30a7\u30d6\u30e9\u30ea\u30a3) is clearly based on the word February, so we should translate it to that instead of just romanizing it to \"feburari.\"  From a bit of google searching, it doesn't seem like any names spelled in english were given in the promo material, and similarly on the re:creators website there doesn't seem to be any english naming attached to the characters pictures, only numbers.  \n\nWhat we do have though is anime news sources, who take the promo material and translate it so we can know what's going on.  For example we have [this](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-02-10/re-creators-original-anime-reveals-2nd-promo-video-main-cast-theme-song-artists/.112079) ANN article from Feb 10 having the name \"Celejia Yupitilia.\"  Since there's no official information on how to spell it, they went with the 'j' route.  You can also see that they went with \"Alisteria February\" instead of \"Alicetaria,\" seeing as they had nothing to go off of.  Obviously we know now that it's meant to be \"Alicetaria\" since we've seen it in english in the show.\n\nA different article though, [here](http://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2017/02/10-1/new-recreators-anime-preview-arrives-with-cast-and-theme-song-introductions), from Crunchyroll, also on Feb 10, shows different romanizations and even an incorrect reading of the kanji in Souta's name.  I would also wager this is where the Celestia name came from, spreading from this article, over into the MAL and AniDB entries, where people can easily go to confirm the spellings of character names.\n\nSeeing as the only clues we have to go off of are what we see animated in the show, and what Amazon translates, until (and if) proven wrong, Amazon subs are the \"most official\" romanization that we have for the foreign character names.  It's obviously not possible to say with 100% certainty (until something official comes out) that Celestia isn't the proper name, but it seems highly unlikely considering the spelling of the name in katakana."

Episode 1-4s of multiple cour series always have infodumps after a mixed bag of action and confusion.\n\nIt also set the price to be paid and/or the goal of Military Girl bringing characters over: She's convincing these characters to meet and force changes to their stories, but all of that doesn't matter if the universe the creators come from resets. If that happens, *their* \"worlds\" cease to exist because they would never have existed in the first place. You can see some of this in the moments that \"Madoka\" overhears her talking to Suicide Girl.\n\nWhile ADHD is entirely possible with these reactions, this sort of exposition is absolutely necessary for a plot that could be potentially *very* convoluted and deep. Even the Fate series has their infodump episodes, and, since everyone's comparing this series to that, I don't remember people bitching about it in Fate/ZERO."

Everything else must be inferred, and Meteora being an \"intellectual\" as a librarian is basically the *only* other person for the job, no matter how flimsy or displaced her theories may be, because there's simply no other way to gather information (other than to find Military Girl and beat it out of her which seems to be pretty fucking hard to do).\n\nIn Fate, everyone knows what's going on but Emiya. In F/Z, *everyone* knows what's going on except sociopathic child murderer who doesn't give a rat's ass if he gets to kill more kids. In  Re:Creators the only person who knows *anything factual* is the antagonist and therefore not exactly approachable except by gathering info from the other \"characters'\" interaction with her before they wound up in the world of the creators.\n\nIf there's any problem, that's it. The solution is simply a massive infodump that's fairly spotty, but probably on the right track. Before now, what has anyone been fighting for except retaliation, \"justice\", or \"fun\". There's been no impetus for anyone to do anything. Now, instead of spreading out the world over several episodes and people complaining about \"when are they going to get to the point?\" (e.g. Shingeki no Kyoujin) we have one episode that *gets to the point* and the rest of the series to unravel the mysteries. Yet, it doesn't matter because the anime community is fickle and wants everything done the opposite of what is done whenever they feel like it instead of taking a step back and actually looking at the whole picture instead of just the frame."

   "text": "I was so happy last week with how was everything executed but after this week I can't help but feel this series is not living up to it's fullest potential and I think it's a shame.\n\nIt's not that they miss that many opportunities but I feel it stays at that point that it's not that good.\n\nLet's say this series has concepts and ideas of value 9, they always execute them in value 7-7,5. It's not a 5-6 but it's not an 8-9.\n\nI think grand part of the reason is that these characters are fictional characters invented within the story and thus they have trouble making them that much interesting. The story seems to be kinda self aware of this, because the magical girl is kinda like a mix of some magical girl characters with the design of Madoka.\n\nIt would be a hell of a license and copyright problem but I think this series would be able to step up its execution a lot if they use pre-existing characters with the premise. That's nearly impossible but you'd have every fucking anime fan watching a show where these famous anime characters visits the character world. Oh I wouldn't I love to see CCA Amuro meet with Tomino. Although depending on who you bring, things wouldn't change much... (Gintoki from Gintama for example is already way too meta about himself)."

They don't stop talking. It's 50% technobabble all the time! The other 50% is this edgy teenager stuff that makes characters go \"my emuutions b so impurtant\" and make them go on and on for minutes about what they feel like about everything.\n\nThings going for the MC so far: he's male. An absolute ghastly, no-presence MC-in-name-only placeholder. In fact, every character designer is male in this show. It's like they needed an excuse to put as many cute girls from different fantasy worlds in a single show but didn't want to be blamed for screwing gender ratio so they decided to make the \"normal\" people male. But even by adding a few secondary characters, the overall presence of male characters in this show is so faint that you might as well remove them altogether and make an anime about 4 girls talking under a kotatsu instead.\n\nI'm honestly considering dropping this anime. It's otaku-bait. It's so otaku-bait it's cringey. It doesn't have an interesting, intricate plot, a deep, emotional story, or even exciting fight scenes. It's just... talk. It's like the \"creator\" of this world was so infatuated with the idea he came up with he won't fucking stop talking about it."
