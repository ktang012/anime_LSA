For me Poland could take symbolic or rather alegorical form of a woman who was raped tormented and and put to the level of sluts. We traged her out of the place sacryficing your will, souls, minds, blood, bravery just to revive her. If this was the case of one man and one woman surely the man would be viewed as madman and murderer who is doing all this to revive his died wife. Selfishly.

On the one hand, Minnie C with the husband-power relying on strength and surprise, while on the other hand, Ichijou has summons and can put a solid defense (The Trojan Horse pinning Minnie in order to buy time to put Sana and Zoroku to a safe position, using chess pieces to block the attacks, even deal with invisible attacks from the rear). The strategies were actually relying on the psychological state of the combatants, with Minnie slowly becoming more desperate with her attacks as she sees her \"husband\" bleeding and Ichijou trying to hold back but ultimately change into her OP offense (The single digits) as the fight got tense. The music track also complemented the tension really well, though the sound design was a little odd at times (No metallic sounds when they walked on the containers....really?). \n\n~~Index S3 fights when?~~"
