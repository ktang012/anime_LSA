   "text": "\"*It hurted more when Akane stabbed me.*\" - 10 Really Cute Things to Say to Your Yandere\n\nFor such a silly show, I like how it actually has an explanation for everything that happens. I mean, Akane is a Yandere but not because she loves Seiji. She's been raised to believe that her knives are the solution to everything. If you get cheated or if your boyfriend is pissing you off: Murder him. She's not crazy for love, her mother created that psychotic nature. Seiji just happens to bring that side of her with every little mistake he does.\n\nOutside of that, Akane is a pretty kind girlfriend but not insanely attached. She will act cold to you because she wants attention and won't push her curiosity any further to give your privacy. She's not your typical yandere. She actually feels more... Human, so to speak. Which makes it weirder coming from this show."
