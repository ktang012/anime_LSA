Essentially, after what Ctholly did in the battle and with Willem partially becoming the beast chantre, the sky was safe.

Willem somehow ended back up in the sky with th help of his former teacher. Willem saves the fairies' home by becoming the beast and have the fairies kill him to prove their worth. They succeed, but beasts cannot truely die and Willem is in a sense sealed. Some years past, Willem apparently reconciled with the beast in him and managed to separate from it. On his way back to the fairies' home, he meets a child very similar to Ctholly, probably her reincarnation, and story ends.\")"

It seems he turned to stone and was frozen and who knows what else magical damage that hurts him when he uses the weapons now.  Its a interesting touch.  \n\nIm glad they got that out of the way now so the girls know hes 500 years old as well as one of the Heroes who used those swords of thiers.

I wonder how long he will live though because it sounded like his life was cut way short from fighting the big bad.  \n\nRegardless, i loved this ep and this series, and i cant wait for more.

He lost his entire race to the beat of violent human nature. He lost his body to achieve his goal, which brought him nothing. And as someone who is hanging on to life by a thread he is very understanding of the value of life and pointlessness of death.

It's trying to be sad through characters being regretful and angsty. But we never see why they are so. By that I mean we never see a battle. We just assume they like the children, even if they are essentially living bombs as well. Nygglatho saw Willem being unpetrified, she should be familiar with his fragile state. Sparring after an all nighter wouldn't be wise even for healthy people.  \n\nThere's just this lack of dramatic impact I'm missing. A drama has a more melancholy, oppresive atmosphere than this.
