   "text": "Good lord, this episode is a total nightmare with the amount of outfits. And I'm not even half way the episode.\n\n[**So much work**](#akkotears)\n\nEdit:\n\nOh god. This episode starts with the [visual gags](http://imgur.com/iMfHQvY.jpg) right before the 10 sec mark. Yoshino, Maki, Sanae & Riri wearing such different outfits portraying their very different personalities was a great opener. Pinkamori as the stereotypical farmer, clashing with the outlandish to the downright bizarre getups, Riri in that ninja Gi and Maki wearing Kill Bill yellow outfit (LOL, she's even wearing the typical [David Carradine hat](http://imgur.com/2JRoeRT.jpg) he used to wear in Kung Fu the Legend Continues TV series). And of course Sanae wearing a beekeeping suit (at first I thought it was a BNC suit) showing off her phobia of insects.\n\nKudos to the guys in charge of drawing [the machinery](http://imgur.com/sCzSnz5.jpg), they went for a very good replica of the [ER112](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSeqzn82kKs) from Kubota. Guess they have their own Diesel san among their ranks.\n\n[Silly Kadota](http://imgur.com/dqnfdQy.jpg), haven't you learned anything from the past order of Manjus?\n\nSanae is and will always be my Bae, but man, the jokes from our [beloved deadpan](http://imgur.com/LTQQgSD.jpg) ~~loli~~ youngster were so on point in this episode. Calling Kumano sempai a [bear](http://imgur.com/FKlVJpW.jpg) (nice puns btw) and also calling Shiori [little Satan](http://imgur.com/2vbh8yh.jpg).\n\nGotta love [this shot](http://imgur.com/9ouXaAn.jpg). All of the girls and even Kuma are wearing comfy sneakers, except for Sanae. Oh boy, that woman loves the though life. There's nothing hotter than a lady wearing heels and pants that show off their ankles. \n\nOh boy, [those dishes](http://imgur.com/2rXutUP.jpg) from the girls. Specially that [nasty soup](http://imgur.com/eOuzpLJ.jpg) our beloved [Riri](http://imgur.com/KKzm551.jpg) was cooking (WTF kind of book was she reading, and was she using it to cook that soup?). I feel for her; even her grandma is polite enough to propose eating outside for the night.\n\n[Cute shots](http://imgur.com/96UwT69.jpg) from Yoshino, she's such a delight watching [her eat](http://imgur.com/f7hQhRM.jpg). Nice detail on changing her [hair do](http://imgur.com/J1GaSdK.jpg) too.\n\nShiori's [grandparents](http://imgur.com/LqwWMsk.jpg) were great, typical sweet geezers offering their grandaughters' hand at the very first opportunity.\n\nSo the girls finally stumbled with a big roadblock. A big screw up due to lack of comunication. Guess we're finally going into Shirobako mode. Reminds me of all the delays due to the Director procrastinating the storyboard in the first cour of Shirobako.\n\nMan, the music has been great in these two episodes, specially in the last scene where Shiori takes control of this cruise.\n\n\n#EPISODE 8 OUTFIT COUNT\n___________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Yoshino's outfits: 5**\n\n[Working Large overall with plaid shirt & big farmer hat](http://imgur.com/wHg9Xkq.jpg)\n\n[Chef Uniform](http://imgur.com/OfaD8qM.jpg)\n\n[Casual blue overall & blue sleeveless shirt](http://imgur.com/PL5zruP.jpg)\n\n[Summer Yellow shirt & jean shorts](http://imgur.com/u4uf6QY.jpg)\n\n[Sailor one piece with unbuttoned blue shirt](http://imgur.com/5xrF6vL.jpg)\n\n\n**Number of Yoshino's variations: 1**\n\n[Queen dress + Summer Yellow shirt/shorts](http://imgur.com/q9fnUqz.jpg)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Shiori's outfits: 5**\n\n[Farmer/harvester outfit](http://imgur.com/pzkgz1p.jpg)\n\n[Chef outfit](http://imgur.com/y7llp10.jpg)\n\n[One piece green pea long dress with jeans](http://imgur.com/NeSeb4Y.jpg)\n\n[Blue long sleeve shirt with folded cuffs & light brown long skirt](http://imgur.com/YWdPMqn.jpg)\n\n[Yellow long summer dress](http://imgur.com/fL8CLCk.jpg)\n\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Maki's outfits: 5**\n\n[Kill Bill yellow outfit](http://imgur.com/wHg9Xkq.jpg)\n\n[Chef outfit](http://imgur.com/1y2WQTg.jpg)\n\n[Tomboy get-up Teal shirt & capri pants](http://imgur.com/IFZJwXa.jpg)\n\n[Purple folded sleeves shirt & shorts](http://imgur.com/4E20Fij.jpg)\n\n[Turquoise shirt & white shorts](http://imgur.com/Ljau3aR.jpg)\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n\n**Number of Riri's outfits: 5**\n\n[Red Ninja Gi](http://imgur.com/iMfHQvY.jpg)\n\n[Chef outfit](http://imgur.com/1WBHC48.jpg)\n\n[Teal shirt & navi sailor plaid skirt](http://imgur.com/7GrYbnU.jpg)\n\n[One piece short dress & blue shirt](http://imgur.com/q9uWp6D.jpg)\n\n[Black shirt with white collar & blue plaid skirt](http://imgur.com/3II5SdS.jpg)\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n**Number of Sanae's outfits: 5**\n\n[Beekeeper suit](http://imgur.com/2lCxdhx.jpg)\n\n[Chef outfit](http://imgur.com/c5CQRa3.jpg)\n\n[Blue Turtle neck sleeveless shirt & Capri pants](http://imgur.com/u4uf6QY.jpg)\n\n[Blue long sleeved shirt & white pants](http://imgur.com/9kJ7V5B.jpg)\n\n[Beige stripped strapped top & black capri pants](http://imgur.com/3II5SdS.jpg)\n\n___________________________________________________________\n#[WARDROBE SUMMARY](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/66b42x/spoilers_sakura_quest_episode_3_discussion/dgh1qya/)\n_________________________________________________\n**TOTAL OUTFIT COUNT SO FAR**\n\n**Yoshino** outfits: 7+5=**12**\n\nYoshino variations: 5+1=**6**\n\n**Shiori** outfits: 6+5=**11**\n\nShiori variations: **1**\n\n**Sanae** outfits: 6+5=**11**\n\nSanae variations: **0**\n\n**Maki** outfits: 6+5=**11**\n\nMaki variations: **1**\n\n**Riri** outfits: 5+5=**10**\n\nRiri variations: **0**\n\n\n______________________________________________\n\n\n\n"

You can say that Maki is doing a more direct cosplay to Bruce Lee's get up, I'll give you that. \n\nBuuuut, she's also wearing a Cowboy hat much a like the hat David Carradine wore in the classic TV show \"Kung Fu\" from the late 60s and also in the sequel Kung Fu Legend continues in the 90s.\n\nDavid Carradine (may his soul rest in peace) was pretty much Tarantino's dream actor for Bill's role in KB vol2. The [cowboy hat](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41DYCNi30GL._SX342_.jpg) is pretty much the signature of David Carradine's career. The way I see it this homage is more oriented to Kill Bill/Uma Thurman & David Carradine than to Bruce Lee."

   "text": "\"The Joye of Snacks\" is a cookery book published by Goatberger in Ankh-Morpork where many dangerous things originate. Attributed to a Witch of Lancre, it was later discovered to be a collection of the accumulated culinary wisdom of one Nanny Ogg.\n\nOnly incidentally about the culinary arts, this is one part cookery book and three parts grimoire, on a par with certain tomes kept under crushed ice in the cellars of the Library at Unseen University. No doubt, if the Librarian has ever received a courtesy copy, he will have repeated the word \"Ooook!\" many times, and determined that this is too dangerous to go on publicly accessible shelving.\n\nA less dangerous version using only mundane ingredients and the sort of things Lancre witches would scorn to describe as \"herbs\" has been released in our Roundworld under the title of Nanny Ogg's Cookbook. While this has the same relationship to the original that Woddeley's Occult Primer has to the Necrotelicomnicon, the recipes do work and there are interesting discursions into the mind and philosophy of Gytha Ogg. \n\nAnd having been written by a witch that has had 5 husbands and been married to three of them, and whose favorite song is the less-than-wholesome \"A Wizard's Staff Has A Knob On The End\", you can say that these recipes are of a horizon-broadening nature at least.

It seems she's still having problem letting go of the past and just wants to everything to stay the same as they are. Looks like she has this fear of taking responsibility too, I'm glad that she decided to take over for Yoshino on this project, with this being her first time taking leadership fuck ups will surely happen so I'm curious how she'll handle things.\n\nAlso we got romance as a side plot this time! [Shi-chan's sister is 10/10!](http://i.imgur.com/RdD3FAX.png) With the feelings between her and Mr. Chef obviously mutual I'm excited to see how those two will end up together :3"
