If it had been broken from the inside by a growing object pushing on the roof from within until it breaks, there should IMO be a lot more roof debris lying around the house. The boards we do see would be enough to account for the outer edges of the roof falling off the side of the house when the rest of the roof is caved in from above, but there's nowhere near enough boards/shingles lying around for them to be the whole roof. \n\nFurthermore, how would you get those limb positions from that scenario? A person turns into a titan, and while doing so sticks two of their legs and one arm straight up into the air through the roof, and only after the transformation is done do they let the arm/legs fall down? Likewise, the hole in the wall around the neck wouldn't fit the whole head being stuck through the wall. \n\nDoesn't discount it as possibly being a human-turned-titan, but the position looks a lot more like it was standing beside the house and got knocked backwards onto the house than exploding outwards from within the house."

(What follows, I've spoiler tagged just in case I'm right. Because if I'm right, I'd really hate to blow a large twist wide open. At the same time, it *is* just a *theory*. I could be completely off base, but this is just what I've pieced together given the info we already have on hand.)\n\n[AoT Theory](/s \"What I mean by that is, the credits show humanity giving something and being given something else in return, and whatever it was...they ate it. And it looks remarkably like a human body - whatever it was - which probably explains the looks of abject sorrow and horror of the kids eating under the arms of the king-like figure.\nAlmost immediately after this sequence, we see Titans rising up out of the sea or ocean and beginning to attack and eat people. Always eating people. It shows humanity running away, but it also shows very graphic close-ups of the Titans eating people and also growing in number over time. So, tl;dr:, it seems eating people turns others into Titans. This would explain why some are smaller than others - they haven't eaten as many - while aberrant Titans seem to be those that were created using Eren's dad's research.\")\n\nI'm still not sure if spoiler tagging this is the right way to go, as it would stop people from reading the theory just in case and thus end discussion on a topic I find to be worth talking about. Regardless, what's done is done, but if you're worried that what's in the black is fact, don't be. It's literally something that popped into my head after seeing the Titan in Connie's house's eyes and the end credit sequence.\n\nEDIT: Holy shit, I finally realized wtf is with all the animals running with Monkey Trouble and the glowing heart things. So, what is the one constant in this entire show? Eating. Food shortages, hunting shortages, food surpluses in hiding, eating people, potatoes, eating more people, apples, always eating more people. It's like the food chain basically rose up and said \"Fuck you\" to the humans. If I remember right, wasn't that literally one of the first lines of the manga/show? How humanity were no longer the top of the food chain? Maybe I'm thinking of another show, but I digress. The point is: Eventually, if the thing that is constantly getting eaten gains enough intelligence, don't you think they'd be pretty pissed? I mean, they'd probably eat you right back."

Sasha is a hungry hunter. She freaked out when she fucks up her tools, or loses a horse (Her family raised horses, and probably ate some. Losing a horse = Losing hundreds of kilos of meat).  \nProof: She went 1v1  melee against a titan without even attempting a killing blow. She don't care bout no titans or [bald men](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/shingekinokyojin/images/1/1f/Keith_Shadis_character_image.png/revision/latest?cb=20130820202306)\n"

When it left the house it had to duck to get out of the door way, and when she finally blinded it it was easily twice her height, maybe even as tall as a house (couldn't tell for sure)\n\nThe titan in Connie's village was strange too. It's arms and legs are way to small for it to be able to move, so how it got their is a very good question. Something of note as well is that it's eyes and Connie's eyes were about the same colour. From how it was laying down, it looked like either it fell on the house, or burst out of it.\n\nMy guess is that somehow people are turning into titans, and we saw someone first turn and someone with an incomplete transformation."

It suits the advanced point the story is up to\n\n* The talk Armin, Mikasa and Eren are having about the walls: breaking through only at the gates, and that they're made from hardened titan skin, is uncannily close to the theories passing around in the rewatch we just had about the reason of titans behind the walls\n\n* The solders it is already very practical, yet it comes at the cost of giving their lower torsos little protection from the cold due to to the necceccity of their jackets and cloaks being short. If I were in the SNKverse, as part of the uniform I'd have woollen bands that slip around the midriff, under the 3DMG kit\n\n* Looks like [good old Nick](http://imgur.com/9XBSqPg) is going to become a significant player. Never would have imagined the wall cultists would become important\n\n* Eh Eren, still hasn't quite taken to talking at a calm tone. Bless him\n\n* Sasha's villagers see her as the equivalent of the town dog. 'Stop! Spit it out! Get it our of yer mouth!' \n\n* [She'd](http://imgur.com/5Gvh4Vo) make a terrifying titan\n\n* ~~What's sad is [here](http://imgur.com/ijU0lCZ) they're beyond even trying to pretend they've not had to resort to cannibalism. There's no smothering the \"meat\" in grass and bark. They're beyond trying to maintain a facade of respectability~~ \n\n* More like he's a titan. But it's too weird, he's human sized and the kid and woman are acting like they know him, that they're resigned to him slowly eating her\n\n* This series has fallen down the ladder into the basement of [grimness.](http://imgur.com/ijU0lCZ)\n\n* It's good for character variety that Ymir is something of a bitch. Also she's got some polish behind that burning\n\n* Ymir is female Jean and Krista is female Armin\n\n* Krista and Ymir chemistry [[1]](http://imgur.com/n51E5ZQ), [[2]](http://imgur.com/0G6uJ9Z),[[3]](http://imgur.com/K9dKBbn)\n\n* In what looks to be a very grim season, we should appreciate it when [this](http://i.imgur.com/wKtxlaW.png) happens\n\n* Please not a death flag for Sasha\n\n* [INNER BEAST MODE UNLEASHED](http://imgur.com/im6JCKv)\n\n* The titans are [special](http://imgur.com/Y6i1mr8) this season\n\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nSasha was awesome and resourceful this episode, doing it all without 3DMG and in a dress too. She's got a great dynamic and has one of the more interesting backstories. Speaking of which, I appreciate how this season we're spending more time with side characters. There was Miche, now Sasha and it looks like Connia, Ymir and Krista will play a large part. \n\nPoor [girl](http://imgur.com/GDZjRVZ). She's shouldn't have been there to watch or listen to that At first I suspected she had something to do with selling out her mother since she had that \"I've betrayed someone\" expression. \n\nMy feeling of foreboding about this titan attack continues from last week. They're planning something. It isn't just a mindless invasion. \n\nSo then, a titan that'd the size of a human and another that can't walk yet has fallen on a house. The thlot plickens. \n\n"

Since Eren has enhanced healing abilities, Mikasa being a titan would explain why she is so skilled compared to everyone else and also would explain why Eren's father used to visit her family.\nFurthermore, all titans are somewhat weird and quirky, I think that might be becuse they retain some of their human personality.\nWhen it comes to the walls, if they are indeed made from that weird titan material, it might be a possibility than there were humans who figured out what was going on with the whole transforming into titans thing and they somehow managed to turn themselves into titans and form the wall, sacrificing themselves for the greater good.\nI'll put away my tinfoil hat for now\")\n"

Also, when a series that is going to be heavily dependent on character development only plans for 12 episodes, there's only so much you can fit in at one time if you want to cover decent ground w/o speeding through everything.\n\nPlus, I don't believe that every character of a series needs to be given elaborate backstories in order to be considered developed. Putting characters in various situations can be incredibly effective, and we shouldn't have to rely on sudden dumps about someone's past in order for them to be considered fully developed. Granted, as you said, the anime is adapting the manga faithfully, so my gripes are more with the series as a whole and not just the anime, but it kinda sucks when most of an episode is spent in the past while the current plot screeches to a halt, all for the sake of making you care about someone you likely already cared about."

That's just terrible writing. We as the audience have no obligation to know beforehand what would have worked or not, we just expect the characters to behave in a believable fashion following some sort of strategic thought process or common sense.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>let's just say that rounding up the priests wouldn't have done a thing\n\nAgain, not carrying out the logical next step and later retconning the whole thing to try and downplay that issue makes zero sense. The characters don't know what's going to happen in the next arc, their actions should be based on what information the have right now. As far as they are concerned, information with huge implications has come to light, and the clergy knows the details."

We have a clip from the Trost district showing the Garrison being called to deal with the situation inside wall Rose, and nothing else. Even if, and this is a big if, we assume that the entirety of the Garrison is being flushed out to deal with the situation, the Military Police, who are mostly concentrated inside wall Sina as the King's guard, could easily deal with the rounding up of the high ranking members of the clergy, who also reside within wall Sina.\n\nThere is literally no plausible reason for no one in the army being tasked with getting answers out of the clergy, and trying to hand-wave that fact away is the reason I find the current direction of the plot absurd and immersion breaking."

E.g the monkey titan and his friends vs humanity and their titans (cause the monkey can control them by the looks of it).\n\nI doubt it's to destroy humanity. Might be to cull people since they have limited resources? or create super soldiers in isolated(villages) areas if they fail (in this case connie's mother by the looks of it) and if it works out they'll have titans to fight with, if not well that might be why so many titans exist?

All of the screen time is given to side characters for no reason (boring your viewers to death right from the start of a season is not the correct thing to do) and the have been no new story elements since the start of the first episode. I seriously don't see how a 12 episode season can afford to waste SO MUCH TIME on this irrelevant content. \n\nMoving on we see that everyone is as per usual scared and shocked from everything ever and hasn't gotten used to it in the first 25 episodes, just in case we forgot how shocked and scared everyone was supposed to get. The same goes for the fact that they expect the audience to be shocked and surprised by giants eating people which is actually the same thing that has happened for the last 25 episodes of the first season, in almost every episode. Maybe it was funny the first time but who actually gets his feelings touched by stuff like this in 2017, not to mention it was done a hundred times before IN THE SAME SERIES. \n\nAnd lets not ignore the atrocious CGI used for the horses.

You didn't like the first season, but you know that a lot of persons do, stop making it sound like its all new to you.\nI enjoy this series and many do, and you need to accept that. \n\n"

It wasn't planned that 5 years later this would be the second episode of season 2. \n\nThis was just giving sasha some development, the series is not that strong in the character department so, pausing the plot to give a bit of character development isn't a bad thing.\n\nNext episode will be very plot and action heavy, so you can relax."
