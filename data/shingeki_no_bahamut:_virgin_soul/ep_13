Gotta keep our eyes peeled for good ol' Favaro.\n\nThe music was rad, the high-fantasy setting feels oh-so-right, and the various action sequences were too cool.\n\nHowever, the best part was arguably the cinematography.

That is one of the best, most unique shots I've seen in anime in quite some time.\n\nThat painter dude in the beginning definitely has more up his sleeve. I thought he was the rag demon at first, but that appears to be Azazel who has caught onto the evil king's ways.\n\nAltogether, a very strong opening for B:VS.

How the fights where smooth as well. The music, the colors, the lighting. HOW WELL they used show, don't tell. Even the backgrounds. Everything looks gorgeous and blends really well together. \n\nWe got to see Kaisar and Rita again!, even freaking Bacchus. And I must say, I love Nina. She seems really nice as a character, and I love over everything else about her is the VA. It's pretty unique for me, and a totally kinda cute voice that fits her character really well. I'll never associate her voice to another character, and unless the VA does next another role that is totally a 180 from this one, I'll recognize her. Loved it.\n\nReally, at times it felt that I was looking at a movie. Really worth it. And Nina transforming into a Dragon when she, it seems, clearly doesn't remember that little fact while she does remember the time when she was 6, surely gives us a pretty huge mystery to look for later in the show.\n\nSo, so good. The best first episode of the season by far."

It's so nice to see the old cast too! \n\nOf course, Kaisar is still a Knight, looks like Rita is working as a doctor of somesort based on what little we saw, Baccus and Hamasa are still the same, and Azazel! I feel like the main focus of this will be him and Nina. I hope we see the two of them interact next episode.\n\nMan this is gonna be interesting, Genesis was all about Humans, Angels, and Devils basically working together against Bahamut. Now Bahamut is gone Humanity has all gone \"fuck these otherworldly beings!\" and have started attacking Holy Sanctuaries for Angels and capturing Demons for slave trade.

But, if you were not emotionally invested in the first one or [Bahamut Big Spoilers](/s \"did not like the cast which is your case here\"), I don't *really* see that changing.\n\nWho knows, though? This season is getting 24 episodes, and I'm guessing it will introduce brand new characters for lead/important roles. So, it could be the case that it'll be different enough from the first that one won't have to see it.\n\n...*Still*, I say, finish the first. Otherwise, it won't have the same feeling/magic. At least from the get-go. :3\n\nEdit: Spoiler tag!"

Hard to say exactly how essential it will be, but it looks like all the old characters are returning so it'll probably be much easier to follow if you watch the first season.\n\n[First season plot:](/s \"The story is set in a world when angels and demons war with each other from their separate strongholds, with humans caught in between. Centuries ago, the angels and demons had briefly worked together to imprison the dragon Bahamut, who was so powerful he threatened to destroy the world. Favaro and Kaisar were rival bounty hunters and former childhood friends, with Kaisar constantly hunting Favaro to take revenge as he blamed Favaro for the loss of his knightly status. The bounty system seems to be operated by the wandering god Bacchus, who hands out payment for their bounties. Favaro inadvertently ended up contracted as a guide for a mysterious demonic girl named Amira, who had stolen a key from the angels.\")\n\n[More](/s \"While pursuing them, Kaisar picked up a follower/companion in the form of the zombie necromancer girl Rita, who took an interest in him. Amira was captured by the demons who had been tracking her, led by Azazel. Kaisar and Favaro teamed up to rescue her, and realised that Kaisar's family's fall and Favaro's father's death were both part of a plot by Azazel.\")\n\n[Even More](/s \"They escaped to the human capital and met Jeanne d'Arc, chosen champion of the heavens. The demons attacked the city to get Amira, but Favaro and Kaisar fought off Azazel and the attack was defeated. The bounty-hunters took Amira to try to find her mother, but fell into the demons' trap. Meanwhile, Jeanne was corrupted by the potion of a villainous alchemist, Martinet, who had been working with the demons, after the king was manipulated into betraying her. Amira was revealed to be an artificial creation that the plotters planned to use to awaken Bahamut. Favaro was corrupted by the same potion as Jean, whilst Kaisar was rescued by Bacchus and Rita.\")\n\n[The climax](/s \"The plotters used Amira to awaken Bahamut, causing her to be absorbed by the dragon. The angels tried to maintain a barrier to prevent the dragon breaking free, but were attacked by the corrupted Jeanne. Kaisar freed Favaro from control using an antidote made by Rita, and allowed Favaro to cut off his hand as a ploy to get close enough to defeat Martinet. Bacchus flew the two of them to Bahamut, and Favaro was able to slay the dragon, losing a leg in the process, but they were unable to rescue Amira. In the aftermath, Jeanne was cured with Rita's potion, and Favaro and Kaisar received artificial limbs before taking off to adventure together.\")"

The red dragon looked a bit autistic though.\n\nOh yeah, Rita is back. But Favaro isn't in the first episode? Color me surprised.\n\nThey even explained the Virgin Soul part of the title. That girl turns into a mother fucking dragon if you touch her. Her relationships are bound to be complicated. "

I thought the characters were obnoxious, the story insipid and stupid, and the animation good but lacking in the ambition it so clearly was going for. I should have loved it, but it just wasn't my kind of tea.\n\nConfession 2) This is absolutely my cup of tea. I love everything about this."
