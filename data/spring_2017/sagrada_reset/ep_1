But them mentioning that Kei being in there is bad is true, and who knows how many of those books he thumbed through before they got there... he could have a lot of new information.  \n\nI really like the setup for the story.  Kei's power is a really powerful one in the context of this world, so its interesting how people tiptoe around him in a way.  The power to remember everything is quite the burden.  As he said to Sumire at the begining of the ep, his memories are the complication, because he remembers the worlds that didnt come to be i guess.  Im curious to see more on that and how he feels about his powers.  looks like next ep we will see that."

They seem to mean essentially the same thing.\n\n> that the guy in the car casually says that they have an ability that can \"revive a demon\", this implies there is indeed an ability user with some sort of real revival abilities, which may lead to the Original Sumire actually being alive (revived) and we can end up with two Sumires the Copy and the Revived.\n\nYou misunderstood that part. The demon was referring to [Laplace's Demon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace%27s_demon), which is a thought experiment that if there were a demon that knows everything about the present universe (in other words, it knows the exact position and velocity of every particle in the universe), it would be able to completely know the future. It was \"killed\" by [Heisenberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werner_Heisenberg), since he discovered the [uncertainity principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle) (which is a part of quantum physics). This principle states that it is impossible to precisely know the position and velocity of a particle. Thus, Laplace's demon cannot exist and is figuratively \"dead\". However, abilities in Sakurada is not constrained by physics, so it is not constrained by the uncertainty principle. This makes it possible for Laplace's Demon to exist again, in the form of The Script."

If the future cannot be changed using the script then that means reading it is pointless in the first place. Another theory of mine: the script cannot be used to change the future because after reading it you forget what was written. That is why it is dangerous for Kei to read the script, because he is the only one capable of actually using it. The Bureau member hinted to this when he joked about even killing Kei for reading the script. Also this is further hinted at by the fact that the old stray cat man seems to remember nothing except for numbers. I think this is because since he writes in the script all day, he has nothing to remember since the script erases his memories of what was written."

   "text": "So this isn't strictly about the anime but I have nowhere else to talk about it. I recently watched the live-action version of Sagrada Reset (part 1) which was very interesting for a few reasons.\n\nOne, it decided to tell the story non-linearly, it follows the events from the plot to free the witch to the resurrection of Sumire with things about Sumire and their abilities being explained in flashbacks. If I hadn't already watched it in the anime I'm sure I would've been hopelessly confused, it makes the story a lot more condensed though.\n\nThe second, and more interesting thing, is that they actually combined the two arcs into one event. In the live-action Murase and Oka Eri plot to free the Witch and steal Haruki's reset ability to force Asai Kei to help them. This lets them resolve the Murase plot by Kei killing himself on Murases hand and forcing her to beg Oka Eri to return the Reset ability to save him. Honestly, I thought this portrayal was (plot wise) a better version than the anime. Murase's arc felt very strange and awkward to me and it also reduces what I feel was the needlessly convoluted way that Kei beat both Murase and Oka Eri to be more understandable.\n\nThe only other major difference I noticed is that in the live-action Haruki shows a lot more hesitation in resurrecting Sumire in a much more direct fashion. \n\nOverall, it was an interesting watch if one that would confuse the shit out of viewers who haven't already seen the anime."

This is because YOUR correct item is one such that you recognize its flaws yet still choose it to be free of Box B because you personally feel like its the one thing that does not belong, therefore making it ultimately good and correct for you (totally subjective, not objective).
