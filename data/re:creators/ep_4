No one would just sit there. As for Magane being there first.. well the author* mentioned that she just kind of does that, even he doesn't know how.  In any case, none of it came across as odd or strange to me; almost all events followed basic logic.\n\nEDIT: I misspelled 'author' as 'other'.

The reason i think this is that if you go back and watch the first use of her power in the book store, she actually uses it twice. Once to place writing on the book (without using the phrase) and then again to summon the hound of cthulu. Shes not as explicit but its definitely a power use when you follow the conversation:\n\n'I'll prove that this is my book, I left a note in this book on page 196 even tho i dont have a pen to write with\" \n\n\"Dont tell such stupid lies *snatches book\"\n\nAnd then Magune grins, as the store owner checks the book and is shocked to see there is a note even though Magune has no pen."

(Swords would make no sense)  \nYour argument is invalid and flawed on several fronts  \na) You assume that when a strong protagonist is taking on another equally strong protagonist, then he/she wouldn't be likely to use his/her strongest ability. Which is flawed. If Meteora is really taking on Mamika(Meteora lacking offensive powers) then it's logical for her to use strongest of her ability, which is real world artilery, not swords.  \nb) The Mecha boy won't attack anyone hand-to-hand if he has the luxury of using his gears.  \nc) In her fight with Meteora, Alice has seen how she lacks ability in attack, so multiple stab wound against a magical girl of the calibre of Mamika is something which she can't pull off.  \nd) Alice is just a Shonen Manga character like Mamimka(Shoujo to be precise) so it's evident that they would lack the intelligence and rationale of a seinen character.  \ne)Magane said that to Souta(my bad not to Alice)\n"

And I was starting to be inclined to agree, then it dawned on me that maybe, just maybe, the sloppy writing is wholly intentional and is actually really good writing. But you need a larger perspective of the overall story to see it.\n\nThese characters, AND their actions, are wholly defined by where they came from. Mamika, magical girl - of COURSE she'd sacrifice herself (in an attempt) to save everyone. Of COURSE she'd have a dramatic death. And of COURSE she wouldn't be able to babble the right words to the right person before she died. Because that's all tropes of the magical girl genre! She's the embodiment of not only herself as her story's main character, but also is confined and defined by the characteristics of her genre.\n\nJust like Alice being easily tricked/convinced by Magane is a defining characteristic of the main character of her genre - the grand tragedy, where misunderstandings are commonplace to create dramatic tension and tragic deaths at the hands of loved ones for no real good purpose. She's restricted by core values she believed her entire life (within the framework of her own story), which were then rooted in 'I must save my world at all costs, damn everyone else'.\n\nIn fact, every single fighter in this show has a very hard time thinking 'outside the box' if it's not already defined for them to be able to do so by their own genre they represent/world they came from. The only reason Meteora and Magane get to exposition so much... is that they are quite literally defined AS expositional characters that talk too much within their own story frameworks. \n\nI'd even go so far as to say the pacing of this story is defined by the real world, which moves slow most of the time, including reaction times (thus the government's response wasn't immediate to the Flare from the previous episode). And all the Coincidences and abrupt appearances are defined by the characters performing them, because that's the rules of how their respective stories work... which run against the grain of how the real world works.\n\nRemember how Meteora warned that their very presence in the real world was threatening it? Every action they take, every word they utter, is probably straining the fabric of reality - even the encounters themselves, with strange coincidences piling up, are likely tearing at the rigid rules.\n\nThe characters are growing outside of their pre-defined boundaries... but the decisions they're making are still completely within character."

None of those are tropes of the magical girl genre because magical girls don't die. They put themselves on the line to save the day and then the power of love or friendship pulls through causing them to win. Babbling the exact wrong words to the wrong person is not something that ever even comes up. Everything about Mamika indicates that she comes from a standard little kids magical girl show like Card Captors or PreCure."

Magic Knight Rayearth, Sailor Moon (in all its infinite glory), CCS, PreCure and its ilk, etc. What you're talking about applies only to the 'modern-aimed-at-young-kids' magical girl shows. You need to step back and look back further to see that the magical girl genre's tropes were so infamous for what I described, that it became lampooned over and over again until eventually the lampoons starting becoming the normal, and eventually we wound up with the kids show variants we have today.\n\nCutesy shows with dark turns were a stable of the genre long before 2000, and it certainly appears they have no qualms digging into the past genres, not just modern interpretations, for this show's \nrepresentatives.\n\nEdit: One other thought occurred to me too. Remember that this is supposed to be a show about what happens when fantasy-based creations suddenly show up in the real world, and how the mixing of the characters and the story-world rules they were created within contrasts/conflicts with how the real world works. Like how shocked Mamika was when her attacks actually blew bits off the skyscraper, or actually really did serious pain to the one she attacked. It's true she came from a little kid's show, but the mix of that level of power combined with reality leads us to an older-school trope where she's the sacrificial heroine in the name of all that is good.\n\nIn other words, leading from one trope of her world (no one ever gets hurt), to a forced situation that bridged her world and reality (everyone gets hurt), and we wound up with something in between... which was still a trope of her genre but not specifically of her world.\n\nIt's possible I'm overthinking it, and I'll be the first to admit that it's a bit of a stretch... but then, maybe it's not. Keep looking for that underlying theme that they took almost an entire episode or two to explain: the interaction of the real world with the fantasy world characters."

So that's why I'm going to tell the story.\"\n\nEverything that's being shown to us, is being told from Sota's perspective entirely, even when he's not present for specific scenes.

Since he's obviously a talented artist himself, chances are that what we're seeing is his way of describing it - or, in other words, a manga artist is describing things the way a manga might, or anime would, or video game would. \n\nI still believe this entire show really is a lot more self-aware than most people are realizing, - maybe the too subtle hints are the biggest issues.

She is giving directions and then carefully crafting emotional abuse by repeating what Souta doesn't want others to know, but the moment a 3rd person reveals they've been listening in makes the blackmail pointless so there's no reason to continue that line of thinking.

While I'm definitely aware of Sota's situation and agree that there's no need anymore for them to have Magane constantly repeat it, I still enjoy her rambling (when shes not talking about blackmailing Sota) since it's just part of her character and she's all about deception and whatnot. As for Mamika you'd be surprised how much can change in a matter of seconds when you're losing blood at the rate she was. Oxygen depletes from the brain and you eventually can barely even formulate sentences. At that point I like to believe that she was only able to say 1 or 2 words at a time and she wanted them to be Alice's name. On top of that she's doing cheesy things because her entire character and story is the embodiment of cheesy. She's basically Sailor Moon with the unrealistic idealism that there's good in everyone. Hell she doesn't even WANT to kill Altair. Even after she got stabbed to death she still wishes to save her. Just too hard not to be cheesy when that's what you've been doing your whole life lmao. All in all I do agree that they could have cut out quite a bit of exposition there by just not repeating what Sota did, but I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt since it IS 22 episodes. \n\nI'm finally watching Fate Zero at the moment as well since everyone and their mother told me to and that it's supposedly a classic anime with amazing reviews. It's a good show! But after finishing the first season of this 24/25 episode show, I've encountered roughly the same amount of exposition in the first 13 episodes as I have in Re Creators (which I dont mind at all). I'm just confused as to why so many people are mad about all the talking. Aside from just a little bit of redundancy, the majority of the exposition has all been relevant and beneficial in my opinion c: "

Who do *you* think did this to her?\"\n\n> \"How do I know it wasn't you?\"\n\n> \"Would we still be talking if you thought that it was me?\"\n\nProduces the same result, and still makes Magane out to be a jerk.\n\n> thus making her death a worthless sacrifice.\n\nMamika talking was worthless. Her *death* was not. The conversation between Magane and Sota happens regardless, which pushes Sota to open up to Meteora. If Mamika had told Alice that Altair was planning to destroy the world, nothing would change, since Alice is still out to get her own revenge on the world that wrecked her own, and bull-headedness is part of her character."

Like Mamika trusting Magane to relay the information properly, because she's a naive and overly trusting Magical Girl. \n\n\nMagane just being everywhere she needs to be is weird. I bet in her story she's a character who just seemed to be wherever the writer needed her to be, because she was that shady pulling the strings kind of villain. So it makes sense for her to just be wherever she can cause the most mischief, almost like an unspecified power she has. \n\nBut then is that good writing? Is the Meta not getting in the way of the story somewhat? You could look at it as the creators using the scenario as an excuse to get away with silly shit, or as a genius commentary on narrative structure and character traits, but it really shows how contentious this show is. \n\nThough it would be pretty unforgivable if these characters never end up developing beyond their base characterisations, they've made comments about changing which is a relief, but I wonder just how far they'll take it.  \n"

It's consistent with the theme and the plot contrivances and cliches that people point out are just a result of the characters following the rules they were designed around in their own stories. \n\nIf the show's main premise wasn't characters being transferred into the real world with little to no understanding of what's going on, you could call them poorly written characters. But they are cliche characters because they are taken straight out of an imaginary world where they had genre specific, defined roles. So far I haven't seen any of the characters act in a way that is contradictory to that formula. \n\nThe show's story lives and dies by the meta, instead of being blocked by it. There's no way it would have been a good show if it used this premise and DIDN'T make the characters fit well-defined genre norms. It would be way harder to properly execute on the theme. So if someone thinks that Mamika acting like a magical girl or Alice being easily drawn into tragedy and misunderstanding is bad character writing, then they are more likely just not a fan of the premise than anything else. It's the whole point of the show. \n\nIn my opinion at least. I've seen plenty of anime like this start good and go to nonsense over time, but I tend to enjoy them regardless. I don't really see the signs of degradation here just yet."

At least in my experience from the classic Movie and the first SAC series. I still have to catch up to SAC 2 and the latest GITS series.\n\nLast in my list would be Deunan Knute from Appleseed XIII, a good mix of a defiant character and a softie.\n\nNever seen the Bakemonogatari series, but probably a lot of peeps would recommend her role as Shinobu\n\n[](#frockychou)"

Souta opened up but still hasn't been able to tell the complete story yet, seems like Souta was the artist but he did not agree with the story direction and did not defend Shimazaki Setsuna as his doujin creation partner, which lead to the event. A high school student couldn't handle this guilt and with Mamika killed off because of him again, he is definitely breaking. It's great that Meteora is there for him, but normally it would take a loooong while for someone in Souta's position to open up and actually have the talks be cathartic. I like how Mirokuji is the antagonist in his story IIRC, but he is actually pretty decent out in the human world.

Magane basically transformed into Exposition-Chan no. 2 and spent 30% of this episode trying to guess why Souta was being a wimp this whole time (which everything said in this episode is already implied way too many times in previous 2 episodes that everyone would have guessed it by now, but even then we are still kind of unclear what exactly he did... I mean being jealous of a talented friend and wishing she/he will die isn't exactly \"guilt worthy\" just because she died), and she is getting a little too edgy for my taste with all her annoying exaggerated behaviors and how she just talks way too much now for the show to be enjoyable. I get it, she is cra cra, can we stop having 40% of an episode just illustrating how she is cra please? \n\nAlso the part where Alice misunderstood Mamika is just retarded.... Mamika had WAAAAAAY more than enough time to tell Alice \"yo gurl, Altair stabbed me, kill that hoe for me... And Meteora is totally cool. Peace out\" instead of just saying bunch of ambiguous shits and trusting Magane, which given their previous interactions, she should have all the reasons in the world to believe that Magane is not gonna be the trustworthy kind of person that will translate your death wish properly. I was afraid they would use that \"misunderstanding\" cliche to make Alice fight the MC crew for another episode before coming to an understanding, and the moment Alice showed up before Mamika was fully dead, I had this glimpse of hope that maybe they won't use that cliche afterall.... but then... NOPE. Goddamnit. (Thank God Meteora and the purple hair guy came just in time so that Souta will stop wasting the audience time... we don't need more misunderstanding cliche in this story which keeps wasting precious time that could have otherwise be used to move the story forward)\n\nThe show seemed to have quite a bit potential but I keep getting disappointed by it every week.

I want so much for this to be the show that it can be, but I don't think it will be, at this point.

They are leaving out the changes in characters like Mamika, Meteora, and even Alice. The main issue is that the characters are built differently, Alice has grown from a 1d knight to a 2d knight. She is just as naive and angry as her character is however she has adopted multi dimensional characteristics. Yuma went through the same as have many of the other characters.\n\nA lot of the people that don't like the show see the characters as archetypes like the fate series use when they are fictional characters that are not longer archetypes any longer.

I figured he offered to draw Altair, actually drew her... and then got told the drawings weren't good enough, and she went with another illustrator. It'd give him more than enough bitter resentment towards Shimazaki to in turn guilt him out when she dies. \n\nDoes he feel *responsible* for Altair as her creator? I don't really know.

Are boring, 10 minute exposition dumps forgivable now if they're meta about it? This reminds me of those meta anime scenes where they acknowledge that the guy accidentally seeing naked girls in the locker room is a cliche but then do it anyway. What value did acknowledging that it's a cliche or bad writing add to the scene? They just want to have their cake and eat it too. \n\n   I'll keep watching in hopes it gets better.

But what is also important to note here is that Re:Creator touches upon the idea that the characters are as complex as the effort their creator puts in. Perhaps the reason Alice falls for Magane's trick is that she's a *tragedy* character who was meant to suffer downfall under deception from a poorly written grimdark story, thus gullible to deception of poorly written standards."

The only normal person this episode was Sota but he barely counts as a character.   Even having some shocked police officers desperately trying to end the fighting would have helped.

Magane is such an interesting character for the series though with her weird position.  She is not even the gray character between the black and white since it's not like she's in between both sides of the argument.  Her only motivation is pretty much her soul entertainment.
