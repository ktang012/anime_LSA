IMO, the subtitle is an acceptable translation.\n\nEdit: this is slightly incorrect, please see the reply below by pwnjob."

   "text": "So far this show is on track to be AOTS for me.  There's a long way to go so we'll see what happens, but I've thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 episodes.\n\nI love the fact that it's a different take on both the small town advertisement show and the work show.  By small town advertisement show, I mean a show deliberately set in a small town either for the purposes of advertising it, or for showing why small towns in general are awesome.  Think Love Live Sunshine, Locodol, Girls und Panzer, Rinne no Lagrange, etc.  In all of those shows the people in the towns are this bunch of lively characters who dearly love their small town and are passionate about it for whatever reason- but in Sakura Quest, Manoyama is just some random small town.  The people who live there just live there by happenstance, because a job landed them there or their parents lived there and they took over the  farm/store/whatever.  I'm sure some of them enjoy living there and some don't, but most of them don't really think there's anything special about the town- it's just one town out of thousands.  This is a pretty strong subversion of the usual trope, and I'm curious to see where it will go.\n\nSimilarly, work shows (Shirobako, Fune wo Amu) tend to be about people who are very passionate about their job struggling against the odds to succeed.  The characters in those shows don't really have doubts about the value of their job or their desire to do it.  Here, everyone has doubts about their job- Yoshino is the most obvious of course, only deciding to stay on after 3 episodes, but the rest of the characters are similar, with the possible exception of Shiori.  Maki obviously did all sorts of different jobs in and around show business and came out to the countryside to do.. what, exactly?  Sanae left the IT world of Tokyo to run a lifestyle blog, or something?  Riri doesn't look like she has any job- her plan is probably just to take over the family store.  Even Shiori is just kind of going along with what someone else wants her to do.  Hell, even the side characters like the old farmer lady this episode and the bus driver are just doing whatever.  None of the characters in this show except the old man are passionate about their work or really about anything, so far as we know- they're all looking for a place to belong in life.  \n\nAnd I think and hope that this will make the show good enough to stand on it's own legs, quite apart from all the Shirobako expectations.  It's a much more, dare I say, realistic take on the whole situation.  Certainly there are people out there who are about passionate about what they do or where they live- but in my experience, most people really aren't.  They just want a small place to call their own, and to live their lives as they see fit.  So I hope the show continues to develop those themes."

I'm pretty sure Yoshino will use all her abilities learned in Manoyama in the future.\n\n>They are both headstrong and earnest and both started off having to work against their will.\n\nThat's completely incorrect. Yoshino had worked her ass off looking for a job, she got rejected by more than 30 companies; she wasn't **forced** to do the job, she accepted the job as queen of Manoyama since she wasn't going to get a job back in Tokyo. She even had cold feet about her job as queen and almost ran back to Tokyo, but she stayed and eventually warmed up to Manoyama; Remember she has the \"option to bail out\", she stays because she wants to. It's pretty much a spin-off of Doctor Hollywood, or if you're younger Pixar's Cars.\n\nOn the other hand Ohana as a teen supported by her mother didn't have that initiative to look for a job, and instead she ends up with her grandmother who treats her worse than the help in the victorian, abused both verbally and physically in the first episodes. She has nowhere else to go, so **she is forced to stay** by the events in the story.\n\n>They are both headstrong and earnest \n\nNo, they are pretty different if you look closely.\n\nOhana is very obstinate or headstrong if you like and also very childish, specially in the love department. She oftens end up pushing her ideas against the whole Kissuiso even though those might not be feasable or practical. She even comes up with very feisty terms like \"fest it up\" (bomburi)\n\nYoshino on the other hand has her ideas of her own, but she's a lot more receptive when it comes to listening to her cabinet and she doesn't force those ideas into others. She's more \"level headed\" and doesn't act on mere impulse after she ends up liking her job. She's cheerful but not loud or extremely feisty since she's already a young adult."

Yoshino is calm, level headed, a bit shy but cheerful, and modest.

She gave a very mean review of her own mother's Kissuisou Inn without even visiting it. She would have Ohana attend her phone calls when she wasn't in the mood to pick the phone up. She had Ohana prepare all her meals with the excuse that she was too busy when she wasn't really.\")\n\nA character doesn't always have to act according to his or her own age.

What critical means depends to a certain extent on the genre.\n\nHowever one may be able to support your assumption if one argues regarding the demographic: given that action reaches a younger audience, which has a higher probability of being less critical, it could make sense. \n"

The first episode gave us a situation and setup, the second started giving her a reason to care, and now the third has solidified Yoshino's determination as a character and the main themes of the series perfectly.

Many of my peers/friends/family and I moan about there being nothing unique or special about the city.  We want to move to other bigger cities or places to experience something else.\n\nSo when I'm watching Yoshino realize that so many young people are leaving town to get a job in the big city and how some disdain the town.  It feels a bit too real. Yeah they say this in the literal first episode from Yoshino's telling but we're experiencing the emptyness of the town and how the young people leaving affects it.  In a way, we're seeing the town's perspective instead of the young people's.\n\nI wonder how the staff in this series is going to tackle this.  It's a cultural issue for sure in Japan but it definitely has a worldwide appeal to it too as well.\n\nThis doesn't mean you shouldn't leave your own city for travel or work but if you leave forever, then doesn't that kind of suck for the people in the town that essentially raised you?  You don't owe them anything but they helped shape you as a person.  Wouldn't it be nice to give back to them, somehow?  \n\nI don't know, I'm rambling a lot.

   "text": "A queen can't rule a country on her own. Helps that her advisors are all quirky qtpies too, heh. Yoshino, in reality, doesn't have much going for her besides being youthful and an outsider (she's a cute, but that's for our benefit really), but it's because she became willing to really get to know the town that she was able to make that speech at the end, as inappropriate as the occasion was. I like that she, much like a Megumi Kato, seems exceedingly normal at first sight, but is actually pretty good at getting people on her side once she's set her mind on doing something. \n\nThe other girls have nice chemistry too and it's a toss-up between Oden and Sanae (love the older drunk and lazy nee-san trope) as to who my favourite is so far. Shiori is nice too but she's more like a mum, and Ririko hasn't had much to do yet. \n\nSakura Quest is living up to expectations so far - it's as comfy and chill as I expected, and the understated comedy is very welcome. Nothing besides the really ugly Chupakabura has been over-the-top so far, and since that's probably being retired, the show can continue with what it's been good at so far: advance the plot of Yoshino 'saving' the town while highlighting her own personal growth. It's rather predictable, but for me it's really all about the journey and being able to sit down to watch a comfy show rather than the plot, so it's all good. \n\nSome more characters were introduced but they weren't developed much - Sandal-san continues to be absolutely random, pity he didn't speak up in the show as his VA is the strangest cast for an anime since Max Powers in Kabaneri, but at least he's doing the previews. We have two cours though, so that's plenty of time to see more characters! "
