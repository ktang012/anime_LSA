Hope he doesn't turn into a Koujuro that's only good as a background piece.\n\nGoing back to our couple, I wonder how much of a hindrance will Takumi be. He's been checking Akane out since episode 1 (the track & field scene) and it's obvious he's interested in her as well. It amazes me a bit how many shots focuses indirectly on Akane's bum without being oversexualized (in a cute harmless way I might say)\n\nI'm glad things went well between Akane & Kou chan with mr Potato. I was actually thinking it would go some other way when he got injured, I was expecting Akane to aproach him and cure his scrapes (Chinatsu would be quite a lousy nurse).\n\nThe extra scenes at the end are quite cute, but obviously the one that pops out is the one about Roman & sensei.\n\nIt's interesting that in the extras there's either sex or physical contact implied in Setsuko & Nagahara's relationship, something kinda off based on how innocuous the series has been so far (I'm not complaining, I'm just putting it out there)"

The dad is a refreshing change from the usual clique of parents in anime who keep hounding the kids to drop their hobbies and extracurricular activities and to stick their noses in their textbooks instead. Not that there's anything inherently wrong with the depiction of that kind of parents (it's actually rather realistic, given that such parents are typical in the Japanese and most Asian societies). But it's good to see another facet of parents who're willingly to be more considerate towards their children and give them the freedom to do what they like.   "

I don't want to go too deep but I want to say something just before I start screaming about one thing... I'm really enjoying the variety we have right now. We have Tsuki Ga Kirei which is a super cutesy romance set with young teens,and then we  have Sakura Quest that is equally cute but focuses on younger adults/post college/uni. Sure Sakura Quest isn't romancey yet, may not be at all, but I'm just glad we can go from worrying about adult life things to then coming back to this cute little anime(that probably won't get much attention this season) and kick back and watch them have their own issues. I don't know, Tsuki Ga Kirei puts a smile on my face that is completely different than anything else this season, and I love it so much for that.  \n\nOkay, now to gush over that voice crack!\n\n\nSO DID ANYONE NOTICE THE VOICE CRACK FROM HOTAROU WHEN HE WAS TALKING TO AKANE AFTER RETURNING THE POTATO!!  LIKE THAT WAS  AN ACTUAL VOICE CRACK! Maybe I'm the only one getting excited about that detail, but knowing that we're dealing with junior high/elementary and for him to get a voice crack, AND THEN START CLEARING HIS THROAT TRYING TO GET HIS VOICE BACK! OMG THAT WAS SO CUTE~! I remember those days early puberty where even speaking was a hellish nightmare because you didn't know what you were going to sound like when you opened your mouth.... omg I'm so happy now.  \nI know it was probably the nerves getting to him about talking to this really cute girl he's starting to notice a lot more now, but it was still a really cute touch :) "

In this case, Kotarou made Akane feel at ease with his words and in turn, he learned something for himself.\n\n\nKotarou's friend x Sensei is really damn cute, I wonder if they know each other from childhood or something. *cough*\n\n\nChinatsu was alright, one thing that I didn't like but was realistic is the way Akane's friends are pushing her to date him, can't they just respect her feelings and stop it?\n\n\nAnother subtle thing to be noted is the way Akane responded after Kotarou returned her potato plushie, instead of being flustered as usual, she spoke to him like a close friend. I absolutely adore this anime."

I feel like Akane and Curly-kun are better developed characters from these two episodes alone than most protagonists in other school romance shows are over the show's whole run time. This show does character development through showing not telling exceptionally well, and it's like every single action a character does and every bit of dialogue has meaning and adds to understanding that character. \n\nI thought the first episode was good, but this one really won me over. I think this is going to be my AOTS, after Natsume. Along with the excellent pacing and direction, the way the romance between the two leads is building so naturally and realistically is extremely well done. I don't typically get invested in school romance series very easily because I usually don't care about what happens in fictional high school kids' romantic lives (much less middle school kids), but I'm already hooked with this show and I'm excited to see Curly-kun and Akane's romance unfold.\n\nAlso, Roman tickling Curly-kun made my day.

The personality and way that both Mizuno and Azumi act are extremely realistic and, for me at least, relatable. For instance, just seeing Mizuno shake because she didn't have 'potato-chan' there to relieve her social anxiety really makes me reminisce about how bad it was for me in high school (even now in college in some situations) to the point that I would tremble and grow antsy. Or the scene at the beginning where where the group of guys are giddily talking about Mizuno's butt, and Azumi of course decides to look at it, but his face immediately flushes red and he looks down. Little instances like that throughout this episode, and even the last episode in the restaurant, really make this show feel as though your looking into someone's life as they are living it without it feeling scripted or contrived. \n\n\nI am really loving this show so far. With the exception of The Eccentric Family season 2 (and maybe Shingeki no Kyoji), this is probably my favorite anime this season."
