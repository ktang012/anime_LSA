The way it is being told could be acceptable for a movie because conflict is reached within an hour (which is probably acceptable for a 3~ hour movie). However it isn't a movie so that one hour becomes three weeks until conflict is reached. \n\nWe're in a sense watching a movie cut into pieces rather than an actual series."

   "text": "This episode really focused on the matter of information discrepancy. If you tell someone something, part of what you meant to say is lost in the transmission and not always do people really understand what you meant.\n\nThis is pretty important in this anime because it means that when humanity agrees to something, they may agree on something they don't want, only because it wasn't conveyed properly to them. This is despite White-Hair-MC-kun (possibly) good intentions.\n\nWe also get to see an interesting difference between the alien and the negotiator. The alien wants humanity to fully understand, judge, and then call the \"right answer\" which is accepting his offer (or not?). However, the negotiator is more interested in getting the other party to agree than for them to understand and judge. He's simplifying, shortening and transforming the alien's explanations in order to get the point across quicker and more amicably to get humanity to agree with the alien's proposals.\n\nThe aliens' negotiating skills are so bad he gives unlimited energy right off the bat thus setting a massive global political shitstorm in the next episode by the looks of it. It'd be hilarious and I don't think it'll happen but I'd laugh at the irony if other countries started fighting over a larger piece of an infinite energy source.\n\nNow to address the weakest point of the show which made everybody's eyes' roll. \"Why Japan?\" Yep, that answer was very bad and much propaganda was had. But let's just pretend the anime is set in a world where that's true for a moment. I mean, the damn thing landed in Japan, so asking \"why Japan\" is quite important.\n\nThe alien, being from \"outside the universe\" is still inside the 4th wall so he couldn't just say \"coz this animu is aired in Japan, u dumb bitch.\" So he said Japan is high-Unocle content instead. This is even lampshaded by the characters \"but anyone would (share the bread)!\" The fact that Japan is high in Unocle doesn't really matter. What matters is that Unocle itself was a concept important enough to be mentioned.\n\nUnocle is about sharing stuff. Probably being in unity. Now he just goes and gives an unlimited energy supply to Japan. Logically speaking, once humanity's got an UNLIMITED energy supply it doesn't fucking matter what country has it. Everybody wins. HOWEVER, he who controls the wam controls the universe.\n\nMy guess is that the next episode is about the alien's testing Japan's \"unocle\" to see if the most unocle country is unocle enough. The name of the anime, \"the right answer,\" implies that there is also an \"wrong answer.\" So if Japan doesn't share their wam and decides to monopolize it instead that's probably the wrong answer.\n\nThink of it, the bread example mentioned a **finite** amount of bread. The energy supply is infinite, but the physical, materialized wams are finite in number. In a future world where all energy stems from wams, if you have only 1 pair and some spies steal it, your country is ruined instantly. It becomes a single point of failure, so it'd be better strategically to have more wams."

The point of this episode or the whole series, pointed out by Yaha-kui zaShunina of so called \"Advancement\", not about bread or Unocle or Why Japan. What he wanted of \"advancement\" is not the material(like technology and such) side of things, but more of basic humanity/mentality advancement. This is one of the trial/question by him, he wanted the right answer from the world. Basically what will the world do or think about the infinite energy, conflict or sharing, if the world find the correct answer, then in a way humanity(as a human) will advance one step. Thats why he said he knows what best for the human, he is testing the human:)\n"

It is also the most monoethnic rich country in the world (aside from Korea). \n\nBoth of these tend to decrease conflict over resources, and since international conflict is a given (from the ep 4 preview), it will at least be helpful if a country can provide a unified front for negotiation.\n\nMany multiethnic multireligious states have governments that have to be formally divided between different groups, like Lebanon. These states will internally implode first if confronted with something worth trillions of dollars like the wam.\n\nSo its reasonable that the aliens chose Japan."

Even [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality) doesn't rank Japan as #1.\n\nAnyways, Japan have a distinctly unique culture but has a terrible cost to it: they're very xenophobic i.e. they're not very welcoming of \"gaijins\", they're not open to new ideas and innovations, and they have an overly competitive education system and work culture. \n\nI just don't see Japan as a culture full of Unocle. It's more believable if Kado landed on some northern european country that have a tint of socialism like [Norway or Finland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model)."

   "text": "I got something different from the bread talk. Specifically, one of the politicians said that all humans would share the bread were it infinite, but because there is a finite amount of bread it doesn't work out that way in reality. Of course, that would be because when bread is scarce, people are too busy feeding themselves to worry about others (which is only natural).\n\nBread is a pretty transparent analogy for resources or energy here (especially given that zaShunina follows up the bread metaphor by immediately offering humanity unlimited energy). He said he chose Japan because many humans in the area were capable of sharing their \"bread\", but given what the politician said about altruism and scarcity I think this says more about the amount of energy or resources in Japan than it does about the inherent decency of the Japanese people. ZaShunina chose Japan specifically because it has many people who are well-off enough to be altruistic. (He may have translated this as \"heart\", but he also said it was only a 51% accurate translation.)\n\nDon't want to speculate too much about the preview, but it did seem like the UN was annoyed that Japan was holding a monopoly on the Wam, which raises the question: why aren't they sharing? Especially when it seems like zaShunina had intended them to?"

Artificially restricted resources are what allow the current world power structures to maintain their influence and infinite free energy would destabilise that. Even if every country was given one of these devices you'd have nations wanting to take others to maintain their control."

At least this level of blind patriotism still isn't as bad as it was in GATE. \n\nAlso out of the 4 episodes so far, Shindou, our master negotiator, hasn't really negotiated anything. It feels more like he's one of the scientists from Arrival, just trying to understand and pass along messages from an alien being. Even in Episode 00 which shows Shindou working his normal job before the appearance of Kado, he didn't negotiate anything, he helped an aging company develop relevant industry tech in a month's time to prevent them from getting bought out. Negotiation implies a back-and-forth or some sort of conflict to resolve, so far all sides have been \"I want this.\" \"Ok.\" Sure there's been one or two points that could be very broadly considered negotiation, but perhaps in future episodes we'll actually see some action.\n\nThat being said, I'm really enjoying Seikaisuru Kado with regards to literally everything else, and it is one of the few shows I'm actively following this season."

Perhaps because I've been so used to see highschooler getting transported to other world/gaining superpowers/making harem. Sarcasm aside, I like the heavy Sci-fi vibe it gives.\n\nI love you too. Thanks for bringing us a new tale^anime and, most importantly, I just love white-haired-emotionless characters. \n\nAnd you're like a teacher: outside the Universe? You mean the fourth dimension or something like that? \"Novo\" or \"Anisotropic\". Psychological vector \"Unocle\", which is something like our empathy/simpathy.\n\nWHAT!? Infinte energy!? Oh God^Yaha-kui ^zaShunina please grant me a Wam.\n\nThe right choice? It's obviously to accept your offer/help."

One comment said it'd be easy to make wormholes and blackholes with infinite energy. That in itself is very scary and shouldn't be done. \n\nI think zaShunina doesn't want us to simply take it, but to think about all the possibilities and what lines shouldn't be crossed when taking it. As well, in the preview, they were saying something about Japan having a monopoly on wam, which that in itself is not a good thing. All those wams should obviously be shared with the rest of the world, but again, it's understandable there will be trust issues and other such things.\n\nAlso wam is a stupid name.

So it's completely normal if you don't get it: it's impossible for us to even imagine what a fourth or fifth dimension would look like. It's like trying to teach a 2D being what depth is, how would you even describe it? That's zaShunina's problem with the whole linguistics thing and the accuracy of the terms and analogies that are being used by Shindo. \n\nBasically, the most important things you need to understand are:\n\n-He calls our planet \"The universe\", and he says he's from outside the universe. He's from another world with higher dimensions than ours called \"Novo\" (\"Anisotropic\"), and he shows that when he does the trick with his arm and the bottle of water. This also makes him probably impossible to kill for us. It's like he's just a player and we're the game. You can kill the character inside the game, but not the actual being who's playing it. zaShunina's current form is nothing more than a vessel.  \n-Kado, the cube, is a boundary object between Novo and this universe. It's also a transforming mechanism. Eg: it needed to \"process\" Shindou in order to let him out. Kado is basically converting formats.  \n-The balls, Wam, draw electrical power from Novo. You don't need to understand how it works. It's more playing with the idea of \"if you had limitless amount of something, wouldn't you share it with others who need that too?\".  "

A universe with more dimensions than ours will have radically different \"laws of physics\". Imagining what a being \"born\" in that world (assuming they have the concept of \"birth\") would behave like gets me really excited.\n\nWhat if they were omniscient, omnipotent & omnipresent (like a god) in \"their\" world? How would they \"act\" in \"our\" world. We have nothing to relate to when it comes to alien beings, so our depictions always add some \"ego\" to them.\n\nSeeing zaShunina offer infinite energy instantly reminded me of [this video featuring Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://youtu.be/HO6ONMLfg5A?t=7m32s). Maybe \"it\" is just toying with the humans. \"Oh look at that, they're surprised at a novo.\", as the show broadcasts in the alien universe with people going \"Aww... isn't that cute.\" \"Oh, and now they're going to fight over it.\"*canned laughter*\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI loved how the show brought up the shortcomings of human language talking about how it fails to transmit information efficiently, and how the \"ego\" plays a big role in it (giving the example of \"the telephone game effect\"). \n\nThe demonstration of the power of a novo was amazing. It must have been difficult to \"animate\" something going in and out of the \"fourth\" dimension. Props to Toei for making this so interesting."
