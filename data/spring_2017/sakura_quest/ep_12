Though her failure to find any means she ends up being exiled to another rural town to work as a \"King\".\n\n- Maki - Decided to return to her hometown Manoyama after being frustrated by her less-than successful acting career in Tokyo, only being recognized for some memorable drama side-character by her townsfolk.\n\n- Riri - A NEET who rarely goes out. Generally being shy around others. Only speaks with Shiori.\n\n- Sanae - Despite being a Tokyoite, decided to escape to the countryside as she couldn't stand the pressure of city life.\n\nUnlike the Shirobako girls, who were schoolmates with a common goal in creating an anime together, the girls here are all gathered by chance, having their own reasons for coming to this backwater town."

   "text": "Wow, okay. I think this is honestly my favourite anime currently this season. There's just something about it that is making it **sooo** enjoyable.   \n\nI love the characters. Yoshi is just super adorable and cute in almost everything she does, but she's still really immature and doesn't understand that simply moving back to Tokyo won't fix the issues.   \nShoiri is so sweet to trying to help her figure everything out.  \nWe got Maki to actually talk and contribute today as well which was really cool!    \n\nWhen she slayed the monster and thew through the manju into the air I couldn't stop laughing . The entire video was hilariously bad, but they owned it and tried their best. Seeing them all come together to try and help Yoshi do this was so heartwarming to see. They had no reason to do it, they could have said no, but they all wanted to help out. Everyone had their reasons I'm sure but it was a start in the right dirrection.   \n\nThis anime will stay at the top of my to watch list. It is only getting better, and I think as we go along and Yoshi gets more comfortable with living out here and with the townspeople, will start to see the real magic come in. :) \n(I do love how Yoshi keeps thinking going to Tokyo is the answer to all problems... And then we have two people from Tokyo now in the picture to who can sit here and keep her in check and make her understand that no, going to Tokyo doesn't automatically make your life better. The journey we're going to go on where Yoshi starts to see and understand this for herself is going to be both heartwarming and I think even a little emotional,and I can't wait.)"

She's so yummy.\n\nSilly Kadota messed up once again and orders 1K Manju because of his antiquated way of counting pieces.\n\nGuess we'll have plenty of [Manjus](http://imgur.com/a/cydsK) instead of [donuts](http://imgur.com/rnqpYnA) for quite a while.\n\nSolid Episode. It was a great way to bond the main leads. So far [Maki](http://imgur.com/KEX3rdm) isn't the shiniest coin in the pond, but her good intentions make up for her blunt comments. Riri seems to be the cute shut in girl fascinated by UMAs (getting some vides from Mashiro tan). Shiori will be the optimistic girl who'll always be there to support Pinkamori (Pink Mewmori) and obvoius Sanae wil play the bigger sis role in it.\n\nWatching Riri as the [genki cameraman](http://imgur.com/c7XWdTd) (Hey! she's more uppity than the whole cast of Sakurada Reset) Maki dressed up as the sexy chupacabras, and Pinkamori as the hero was such a delight.\n\nIt was a nice outcome to see the hard work didn't allow them to sell the 1k boxes, making part of an excuse for Pinkamori to stay longer. I wonder if the whole series will be her accepting her place as queen out in the sticks; just as the real Mewmori realized working as AD was her true call.\n\nP.A. Works never ceases to amaze me when it comes to details in their series. The amount of books tapes, and other accesories/items in [Riri's room](http://imgur.com/aT5Dm2H) is so nicely detailed.\n\nWe finally get to see the official ED. And I'm calling it already, it's the best Ed of the season.\n\n"

I'm definitely looking forward to rooting for this cast. \n\nI do want to point out how much of an asshole Kadota, the grumpy manager was. It was his idea to order the manju in the first place, and he did fucking didly squat to help sell them. In the end it costed the tourism board however much it took to make them.

Not feeling Maki that much.\n\nSome funny/cute/adorable bits from Yoshi. She is carrying the show by her own IMO.\n\nThe animation still looks... average? I don't find the right word. The soundtrack is good and the ED theme was really nice.\n\nYeah, P.A. Works is building something special with this anime."

The rest of the cast are nice as well, though Riri and the dev who hasn't spoken with anyone in two weeks are a bit too relatable...\n\nI'm also glad that atrocious commercial didn't work out, that would of been cheap af. Let's see how they will actually advertise the town with those cherry blossoms."
