I also can't help but feel like he's going to realize that the key to using One For All isn't to use it at all, but rather let it naturally be a part of you. I think what he's been trying is the equivalent of All Might going balls-to-the-walls all out, and he's just pushing his powers to the limit. I'd go so far as to say he's starting to use it naturally already.

He underestimates himself because he was quirkless, got bullied and suffered truma when he found out he doesn't have a quirk. He left like an outcast. I think they're really trying to get this point across, especially when he had the talk with Todoroki last episode when he said something like \"I'm not as good as you\" but then said he'll still try to win. They're showing us how he's starting to believe in himself because now he has a quirk.  \n  \nAlso, what I love and what makes this a great show is that they're not doing the generic \"he was weak, he became powerful and now he uses that power to be OP\" thing that a lot of anime do. That trope makes the person look the opposite of an underdog which is usually what people want from weak MCs. But they stuck to the underdog story. He's still using his brain to win, the quirk has the potential to be his downfall so he's still using the skills he has before he got it because the point is that his skills are better than the quirk. It's the man that makes the quirk, not the quirk that makes the man. It's the same person, the difference is that the quirk was a confidence booster which he needed to trust himself."

She needs a series of good fights to demo all her tech, and Deku's bounty nearly guarantees he will see all the action. And Deku's quirk is so powerful it destroys him, so he needs tech to supplement his quirk. So of all the contestants, he's the most likely to accept and use her tech. Seems like a win-win.\n\n 2. Another possible matchup is someone who thinks Deku would be an easy matchup in the final stage for them specifically. Someone with both the long term strategy, an air of arrogance, and maybe a paper to Deku's rock.\n\n 3. Finally, if you assume 2-5 agree the most likely plan to succeed is to band together against #1, and that the finishing order reflects power levels the bottom tier will be 1 man short. They'd be the team most improved by accepting Deku.\n\nWho's on that bottom tier team?\n\n- Captain Fabulous (Yuga)\n- Gadget Girl\n- Anonymous Invisible Guy\n\nGadget Girl already has incentive #1 to join, and the rest of that group would frankly improve their odds of both winning a battle, moving on to the third event, and getting press coverage."

Like, the dragon balls aren't deus ex machina because we know that they can bring people back from the dead. Similarly we see, pretty consistently, how dangerous One For All is to Deku in the manga and he has to adapt to the damage he does to himself. So not only is it not deus ex machina but it also has actual repercussions - you can't do much more than that.\n\nAlso sorry, but you don't have much respect for authors.\n\nIf you want to write a good story, you need to be aware of what makes a good story. A good twist doesn't always make a good story, that just makes a good mystery story. This story would not be possible if Deku didn't have a power, it'd have to be a completely different story - you couldn't have him in class A for example, he'd be completely outclassed. Ultimately you also risk him surviving and gaining popularity being contrived and plot armour-y because you have to come up with something which very well COULD be deus ex machina. Like, there is literally no way a normal person is going to win to a lot of the people in classes A-B. It would be bullshit if they did - to use Batman as an example that series is rife with plot contrivance and stupid gadgets that are useful for exactly one purpose.\n\nIt's got nothing to do with being cynical, it's about being realistic. The story that Horikoshi wanted to write was not one that could exist with a main character who had no power. As someone who has done a fair amount of writing, it's pretty insulting that you think that what Horikoshi did is in some way just for the cash. "

It's a power that has been shown to have a very blurry upper limit.\n\n\"But it'll harm Deku if he uses it!\"\n\nSo far any time he uses it he either had a clever way of circumventing that, there ended up being virtually zero repercussions despite catastrophic damage to himself, or he just \"happens to know how to use it\" that time.\n\nIt's an excuse to *not think about* how Deku might get out of a situation with his brains. Imagine if Deku faces a real difficult problem, that Horikoshi just scrambles to find a solution for. With All for One in place, he can ultimately just say \"eh, fuck it, I'll just make him overpower the thing\".\n\n(A bit of a loosely related tangent, but I thought that he didn't get damaged after punching the brain guy at the end of season 1 because they explained that his body had the odd property of somehow \"mitigating\" force expelled upon it, rather than straight out enduring it. But then they kind of write that away at the start of this season with Deku mentioning \"I think it was because it was my first time punching a person? I dno lol\". Which kind of sets up what I was talking about with \"just happens to know\" when necessary.)\n\nI was being flippant with my \"sweet, sweet cash\" statement, but it's still fairly apt. If the author originally wanted to write Deku with no powers, then yes, he originally wanted to write basically Batman. In other words, he set out to write *a completely different story*. I already stated in my first comment that I don't think this story would be what it is without Deku having powers, I didn't just mean figuratively as in \"it wouldn't be as good\", I meant it literally too, as in, this literally wouldn't be the same story.\n\n(Another tangent, but Batman's contrivance level vary massively from author to author. Sometimes he seems to have a literal super power of being \"always prepared\", while other times he ends up getting dragged down into a fist fight with an opponent twice his size. It's why I have a hard time getting into dc/marvel comics since they're basically an endless trough of rehashing stories as told by many differently competent authors. (Still love me a bit of Batman now and again)).\n\nOf course writing Deku with no powers would have been difficult, that is the challenge of writing an ambitious prompt. Would it have been at all possible without resorting to heavily contrived plot points? I don't know, I ultimately have no idea what the authors capabilities are. But even then, some people like stories that have massive complicated plot contrivances. Just look at Death Note or any similar sort of story where the characters have somehow almost supernatural powers of deduction, or basically know exactly what the other characters are thinking.\n\nIf you've done your fair share of writing, then you should understand that sometimes authors just write to get payed. There's nothing inherently wrong about that, a guy's gotta eat, but I don't like comparing stories that have clear passion and/or thought put into them, to serialized shounen that are almost the definition of \"let's pump these out until people get utterly sick of these. Then we make a new franchise and do the whole shebang again!\" Not to say that Boku no Hero Academia is one of those. It isn't. *Yet*.\n\nAnd why would it be insulting towards you specifically if I think one author is a hack? And again, I haven't actually called Horikoshi a hack, I just said that him giving Deku powers means that he's writing a completely different story from what he set out to write, and that it doesn't help that these powers are basically a lurking Deus ex Machina.\n\nYou're right, I don't respect authors. Or rather, there *are authors* that I don't respect. There are authors that I have the utmost respect for. Their skill, passion for the craft, and indescribable wit is something I long to achieve some day myself and I can't overstate my love for the existence of these people. But there are also a whole tonne of authors that I have exactly zero respect for. The amount of people pumping out bland, generic, cashgrab stories is rampant, especially in the anime industry. This season alone I think I've watched at least 6-7 pilots that were just complete generic trash with barely a shred of originality. Just because I show a little bit of scrutiny doesn't mean I don't respect authors. It just means that I apparently hold them to a higher standard than you.\n\n*Aaaaaall of that* being said, I still love Boku no Hero Academia as it is right now. I like the way that he's used his powers so far, I like the character designs and the flow of the story up till now.\n\nI wasn't shitting on anyone's work. I was simply making an observation regarding the nature of writing.\n\nThis comment ended up way rantier than I planned..."

It gives each character a chance to show of how they put their skills to the test and makes it a lot more tactical and clever than just trading punches. The way Izuku made it through without using his quirk was really clever. Brains over brawn! The three-way rivalry between Izuku, Bakugo and Todokori was great, and it feels fitting that Izuku would take it. Next event seems pretty damn interesting because it forces Izuku in a defensive position where he has to deal with interacting with the other students.

Also Uraraka of course, and someone else from class B.\n\nI think everybody else is going to avoid him like the plague; both his friends will probably comedically apologize and say they want to win too badly.  But I agree support-kun is the most likely pick.  In fact I think those two will just pair up with no third.  Support-kun seems kind of crazy, has no friends who made it to the finals with her, and she's also likely to be underestimated given that she's a support; either they'll both be left solo and be forced to pair up since you need at least two people per team, or she'll just be okay with joining Deku since everyone will be watching them, and she'll figure she gets to show off her gadgets even if she doesn't make it into the next round.\n\nFrom a writing standpoint, she's also a very likely choice.  The writer seems to like to just throw unlikely groupings together with Deku in order to show off characters better; in the last season we got to see Deku grouping up with Tsui and Mineta - two of the most random and least likely candidates for either a serious actual battle sequence or any character development both got a lot of characterization because they were on screen next to Deku.  I'm almost 100% sure Deku is going to get matched up with someone that isn't in class A, and just about the only people we got any significant characterization of in the last episode were the B-class metal kid, the support girl, and the C-class dude.\n\nDeku has demonstrated he's very resourceful and pairing up with someone with a ton of cool gadgets makes it very easy for the writer to come up with explanations for why he wins or at least still makes it in to the next round.  It also gives him a cool opportunity to train his power; if he's carrying her (probably more likely than her carrying him) he's going to need to use One For All to keep his arm and leg muscles from wearing out, but because he's not focusing on building maximum power to hit something as hard as possible he's not going to need to disintegrate them like he usually does.  So maybe as we're leading up to the start of the round he's like dying to lift her up (even though he's quite stacked she looks like she's still taller than him and is weighed down even further with gadgets), but just as the fight begins he manages to trigger OFA.\n\nAs for Uraraka, I think she'll join up with Iida and Mineta, with possibly a fourth person in the mix who has some ranged firepower; basically Iida can run around at full speed since everyone other than him is weightless and it'll be very hard for everyone else to fall off if they're stuck thanks to Mineta.  All you need to complete the transformer setup is someone with some decent mid/long-range firepower who can actually score the points for the team.  Although Deku can *possibly* be one to do it with his finger-flick canon."

You all soon will found out why Deku is the madman we all need in shounen manga. And the best part? This is only tournament 1 of 3. The manga has yet to get to their second year, so next years battles could be even more wild once everyone (Deku especially) gets better at using their respective quirks.\n\nGoddamn I love this series."

The only difference between them was a mine field and we could see that thanks to the flying ability, he had no problems catching up with Todoroki. Please, don't forget that there was a canyon like structure in between with several ropes to climb along and it was again shown that Deku was way slower than a flying guy or a guy skating on them.\n\nTelling me the story about a guy who will be the greatest hero of all times is ok, especially if he uses is braing instead of muscles / quirks, but cheating him to the first place is a boring way to tell me that. \n\n"

All he had to do was get into the top 42, but the way it is written currently makes everything going forward much more interesting. \n\nDeku getting first is more plausible than you're giving it credit for though. The scene of Bakugo attacking Todoroki is actually anime original, in the manga he is just about to pass so Todo freezes him himself then they are stuck there pulling eachother back. Also the minefield is hardest for the person in first because there are more mines than there are for anyone else. Todoroki couldn't have just frozen himself a path because the field is too big for him to do so, and he didn't want to create a path behind himself for other people which he states in this ep. Deku is near the back of the pack when he approaches the minefield along with the other students whoes quirks wouldn't have helped them with the previous parts of the race. Bakugo can't simply fly forever and doing it as much as he did this ep alone was too much for him, he almost certainly had to land offscreen. \n\nAs I said, it doesn't matter that Deku got first place because the story would have played put extremely similarly either way, but now things are more interesting in every conceivable way. \n\n "

They also setup the giant robots as some sort of huge challenge everyone would have to face at the end of last episode... and then almost nobody actually had to face them. \n\nWe've got a lot of fans shouting excitedly about Izuku's \"genius tactics\" upthread, and I'm happy they're enjoying the show. But for me, I don't really get the excitement - given the hype, I was expecting something showing his progression more, like if he's mastered the only-break-one-finger power flick from last season during his training time and surfed on the robot panel by doing one of those flicks behind him, or something like that. Instead, I feel like Izuku is just winning because of the narrative cheating by letting him catch up between scenes, and making everyone else act stupid (e.g. if Bakugo is so dead-set on winning and can fly over the minefield, why would he bother landing to confront Todoroki? He's obviously going faster than Todoroki since he caught up, just keep flying and win!)\n\nIf the fundamental consideration here is that Izuku isn't used to using Quirks so he \"thinks outside the box\", I feel like that is being undermined by how little the other characters use their quirks. If Todoroki is so Quirk-accustomed and so competitive, why wouldn't he freeze the ground on all the paths, and the ropes as he passes? PinkSupportGirl's hover-shoes should let her pass right over the minefield rapidly. Can't Momo materialize a parasail and fly right over the canyon and minefield? Steel and Hardening guys should be able to just run through the minefield not worrying about the damage, but instead we see them walking carefully. If no one seems to be using their Quirks all that much, how are they any different than Izuku, and if they aren't any different why is he then the only one who can think \"outside the box\"?\n"

Let's recapture what happened:\n\n- Bakugou could start way earlier than Deku, if we take the robot fight as the real start point. Between Bakugou's \"start\" and Deku taking the shield, we can see numeral attacks of the other students against the robots. If we take also into account that the girl who can make everything out of her body, then we know that there was a rather a long time, because she said she would need more time for more complex things and she have a cannon there. a cannon, that is not so easy. \n\n- Bakugou's travel speed is also much more higher than Deku's and every meter between the canyon and the robots is a win for Bakugou. We know that the track is around the stadion, which looks rather big. Also we see that the canyon has some dimensions, so the arena has some distance to the track. That makes the radius bigger. We saw in the first season that Bakugou is one of the fastest on the 50 meter track, I think he was 2 seconds faster than Deku, who hadn't to carry any shield at that point. So I would argue that Bakogou gets a time bonus for every meter.\n\n- The canyon is no problem for him, flying across it. Here he should gain again some time, seeing how slow Deku is while carrying the shield.\n\n- Again, there has to be some meters between the two obstacles.\n\n- At the mine field, Bakugou reaches Todokori (sounds wrong, sorry), a bit too late in my opinion. Ignoring that, they \"fight\" at the end of the mine field, and now every other student and Deku can reach it. Now there are two possibilities: They fought for a super long time ignoring everything, or the anime ignores every logical time frame. At this point, the anime looses the logic already.\n\n- Now Deku reaches the mine field and has to build his bomb. Looking how long he needed for one, that should be a long long time, you can see 15 mines in the hole plus some more under them.\n\n- Even, even if he is fast enough for all that, now he has to reach the finish before the other two. Again, Bakugou was on the 50 meter run around 50% faster than Deku, but who cares now ?\n\n"

So the fact that Bakugou blocked it is because he was prepared. In the case of the obstacle race, the strongest attack Bakugou saw was the one Todoroki performed against the 0-point robot. It had a delay before activation. It was also weaker (because Todoroki didn't want to immobilize it but freeze it enough so it'll crumble and fall).

At the end, Deku also had to set up his big explosion, which should take a rather long time. \n\nI can't even believe that Todoroki was faster than Bakugou, but it's acceptable. Not so much with Deku. "

Kinda weird that after carrying that hunk of junk, he didn't seem *that* far away from Todoroki and Bakugou. Though I guess that may be explained by him being fairly strong from having had to work out for \"One For All\" and Todoroki being drastically slowed down by the mines and Bakugou.\n\n> Guy with jet engines should have probably been in first place\n\nTrue, seemed like his category for sure but i'm OK accepting that he tried to outrun/brute force his way through the mines and paid the price by being blown back repeatedly.\n\n> people who can fly should also have an insane advantage\n\nWas there anyone like that except Bakugou (kind of)?\n\n> people who can turn their body hard should have been able to run through the mine field no problem but they walk slowly\n\nWere they shown walking slowly? I can't remember. But yeah, that's what I thought too. Overall though, all that really mattered was that they were behind Todoroki/Bakugou who have had huge quirk advantages in most areas and ahead of Midoriya, who's been lugging around a hunk of metal and just running.\n\n> Girl who can make things out her body didn't bother do make anything like roller blades to go faster.\n\nYeah, there'a actually an important stipulation to her power that I don't think the anime has mentioned yet, but she can't just make whatever she wants whenever she wants it."

But it would be fun if the author really does think of \"luck\" as a Quirk. \n\n\nLarry Niven had fun with that concept in _Ringworld_ and its sequels. There's a lot of potential to use it that way in Hero Academia without having any _Deus ex Machina_ issues arise. I mean, we already know that his \"luck\" hasn't protected him from average threats, and has never manifested as obviously as it did for Teela Brown and the other people recognized by the Puppeteers as the long-term outcome of the Birth Lottery.\n\nOne for All, combined with a Quirk for luck *would* make him the ultimate hero."

I'd say he's probably just inherently lucky as he's a MC, our story revolves around him and thus he's going to have some amazing moments that can only be attributed to luck *in universe* (from our perspective it's just plot armor).

The fact that she chose mortaility is something her luck couldn't compensate for.\n\nLikewise, if Midoriya has a \"luck\" quirk, it made him so lucky that he was given the One for All power, out of all possible people in the world who could receive it.\n\nNot saying that this is how the story will unfold, but saying that if the author has read  Larry Niven's most famous book, the reference to \"luck\" might not be accidental."
