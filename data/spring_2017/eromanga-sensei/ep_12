I don't really know exactly what it is or if it's the same from country to country. \n\nI understand perfectly that people that are in those ages think it's something form another world since people are pretty divided by age in schools and are taught since small that age difference matters but once you hit 20s the whole age thing gets thrown out the window, as long as the other is of age of consent, ofc."

I get that since its a light novel they have to pander to high schoolers, but the main character being a published and successful light novel author in middle school is just dumb. I didn't like it in OreImo and I won't like it here, but it wasn't the point of OreImo. Just put the main character out of high school and the sister in like 1st or 2nd year of high school. Stop using a high school setting to force interactions between other characters you fucking lazy author. And the sister is like 12. Which means she has been drawing what amounts to softcore porn professionally since she was 9/10. Can a company even pay someone for their art without having some sort of registration about who they are? And killing off the parents is dumb. Really I'm just watching this because I liked OreImo and ClariS."

If the writer writes her terribly or tries to make her as cute as possible, it can feel like she's got less character and is just there to pander to the audience.

Instead, she stays in her room being useless all the time. In other words she knows she's putting nothing into this relationship. This makes her feel a combination of guilt and appreciation for her brother, but the guilt took over. \n\nHer thinking that they're not a family is due to her disliking herself not due to anything on his part.\n\nSo after his remarks \"we're a family\", what it looked like to me is that she got really guilty about how she's acted for the past year, (as I bet she has been throughout) and the main way of coping she knows is to isolate herself (Not a necessarily good way of coping but it is a very real one), so she told him to get out.\n\nAfter that I bet that she thought \"I'm not being a sister right now either.\" alone in her room, and got more depressed, confirming her belief that she isn't his family.\n\nAnother thing that could be going on is that she is avoiding getting close to people because she's scared of losing them.\n\nAnyways, I'll probably find out more later in the series."

Of course, the latter half of the episode where both of them see each other's face after so many years of seperation also explain the reason why she shut herself in. I think this is a really good attempt of beginning an anime, it gives more screen time for other future main characters to shine *cough Yamada Elf-sensei cough*. Also the brother and sister's interaction is really really sweet and Sagiri looks like she's competing with Kanna on the moe-est girl of the year already\n\n9/10. Very promising start, let's see how this goes, especially the romance stuff, since blood-related isn't an issue anymore unlike Oreimo"

If Sagiri never leaves her room, than how does she have all that stuff like PS4 pro and Xbox One, posters of novel e.t.c?

   "text": "Honestly, that episode made me rather happy! I expected it to go full ecchi on us and thus thought it'd be rather terrible. Turns out it's not like I expected at all and that's fine.  \nIt's impossible to not compare it to Oreimo (IIRC, it was written by the same author). When it comes to protagonists, I think Oreimo's got the better MCs. The dynamic between them was fun to watch if a bit frustrating at times.  \nFor Masamune and Sagiri, it's only the first episode but they didn't hook me, same with the dynamic between them. But it's got time to develop both of them to more compelling. I hope Sagiri will become more of a character instead of this \"Am I cute?\" *winks at audience* feeling I get. Say what you want about Kirino and her being unlikable, but she felt like a real character in the first minutes in my opinion.  \nOn the topic of theme, I think Eromanga Sensei's better than Oreimo based on the first episode since it looks like it doesn't want to be pure comedy and tries to be heartwarming at times. And it has potential to show it due to the protagonist's pasts. If it executes such scenes well and doesn't go full ecchi or \"I wanna bang my sibling\" that hard, it can be a good surprise.  \nThe humor was average to me. The \"Don't touch me\" scene was hilarious to me though.  \nAll in all, I actually have hopes for it to be good and will also follow it to the end."
