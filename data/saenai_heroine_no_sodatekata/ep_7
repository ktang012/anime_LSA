Tomoya is normally quite dense and I want to kick him from time to time, but if he stuck to script and apologized to and sweet talked Eriri in episode 9 last season, I would actually look down on him more, because that was not something Eriri needed at that moment.  \n\nHer pride as a creator was challenged by Izumi's new found talent, so she needed a little \"push\" from a fellow creator / otaku culture connoisseur to solidify her resolve.  Besides, with years of baggage  buried between the two, a heart-to-heart shouting match between two close childhood friends could actually be a healing experience.  She abandoned Tomoya in the first place and shunned him in schools for years, while he continued to share anime and games with her without spoiling her social status in school, so at least in that regard she owed him an acknowledgment if not an apology.  Delaying this exchange further would only drive them apart even more as time goes on.\n\nSo while people may think Tomoya was heartless last season in episode 9, I think that was one of the high points of his character."

That scene confused me a lot last season because while I somewhat understand the reasoning for that fight happening, it seemed to resolve by them just shouting at each other that she would become the best artist in his eyes or something to that effect. I remember no apology made on either side.\n\nI'm also suspect about what Eriri's entire issue with Tomoya was at that point. If it was because Tomoya just liked Izumi's art more than hers and she was hurt, is Tomoya just in the wrong because of that? Is it because she felt entitled to Tomoya's praise because they were supposed to be close despite the fact that they are outwardly distant (by her hand)? Idk what she was expecting or what she was doing in that scene.\n\nI guess if I apply this logic? to Tomoya's baggage with Eriri, I guess she had no realistic choice but to abandon him. \n\nBut I still feel that \"abandoning a close friend\" and \"not liking my art more than hers\" are just two whole different levels of grievances that made the resolution of the fight even more awkward; \"I forgive you for liking her art more than mine\" vs \"I forgive you for abandoning me for years\" just sound way different.\n\nIf I have this understanding of their fight wrong though, pls let me know (I would love to figure out that mess)."

She never considered his feelings from when they were younger. Aki's issue involved how he viewed Eriri as an artist and as a friend who abandoned him. \n\nI wasn't really a fan of how the show resolved their arc, but I put most if not all of the blame on Eriri. Aki was within his right not to apologize about liking another artist's art. However Eriri never apologized for abandoning Aki and shunning, yet she still wanted his attention."

Yet, they are all somehow competing for the MC and are unintentionally trying to win his affection through their work. However, at the same time, Eriri and Utaha simultaneously found that it would be fruitless as Aki has more or less dissociated his romantic feelings from his work. He also seemed to be more drawn towards Katou. At the end of the day, do they really want to make this game that much? Or was it a favour for their dear Aki-kun? If that's the case, is it still worth it to continue if you won't win anyways? These are some of the thoughts I could see them having. Accordingly, they might have triggered this slump. Utaha was able to fix it a bit but that's mostly thanks to her professional experience. Regarding experience; it's a valuable tool in the industry. Alas, it's not one Aki-kun canprovide them with. Should you stick to a company/employer even when you don't see any room for growth? Or is it time to move on? Are the risks worth taking? Aki has to step up and inspire them to give their best or they'll make a mediocre, half-baked, unfinished product.\n\n[](#lifeishard)"

It's still an issue since they're young, but not as big as not telling Tomoya of such an offer. I owned a business so I've seen stuff like this. It's not like they thought any less of him. Utaha continued to talk to Tomoya and interact with him. They just got a better offer. I can understand why Tomoya and Katou feel the way they do especially since this is their first project and their age. They feel they should have been told beforehand.

Personally, I've never been that bothered being put into a somewhat similar situation.\")\n\n[LN Stuff](/s \"I think you misunderstood me. I don't think there was any real backstab like you.

He helps Tomoya get costumes to bring back Eriri the first time, provide him with a ride with the second incident regardless it being late and extremely short notice, thoughtful enough to buy clothes, encourages him to continue with his dream, believes in Tomoya to be able to pull things off, pulls the group on course again in multiple ways, provides Tomoya with a new artist entrusting Tomoya with his sister, is thoughtful enough to give Tomoya space to work things out multiple times, etc. He may have a bit of an attitude problem but his actions are a Grade A friend. He does all of this with little fuss and almost no questions asked. Never really makes a fuss about how little praise he gets either. He just puts up with it. Even with Katou. He never blows up on any of them, even when they are both can get rude to him which he deserves to some extent. I'll recognize his actions. He's a good guy.\")"

   "text": "The issue with the argument here is that his obsession over 2D or whatever you want to call it hasn't even been a thing for much of this season. Tomoya's development is that he's entering this unfamiliar territory and being made to choose between what the creatives want and what he's most comfortable doing.\n\nOn the contrary to your observation, Tomoya trusts and cares too much about Eriri. The reason they got into this mess is because he couldn't bring himself to push her, and now it's too late. He can't keep pushing back the deadline because the entire circle is relying on Eriri to complete her work before Winter Comiket, which is around the corner (iirc, in the LN, it's literally like 2 weeks away, and they still have to script the art and make physical game copies).\n\nTomoya was being pushy about the deadline most of the episode, yes, but towards the end he is genuinely concerned. He doesn't know if it's right to listen to Eriri or just tell her to fuck off with her bravado and just accept that she can't finish in time. But he decides to trust Eriri because, frankly, he's too weak-willed to say no to her. He was even willing to scrap a third of the game to take the weight off of her shoulders, but it's *Eriri* who wouldn't want that.\n\nI don't think MC is a bad guy -- he's just an inexperienced producer who has no idea how creatives work. His interactions with Utaha demonstrate that. He is constantly battling between Eriri's well-being and her pride. This time, he chooses her pride and it ends badly."

I think your perception of how he is not sure how to manage people on a team is spot on.  \n\nHonestly ineptitude at leading a team isn't the issue I have with him. \n\nUtaha ep + some other things I've seen during both seasons so far makes me feel like MC treats his teammates like game-making tools rather than people.  He's so caught up in making the best game ever that he stopped paying attention to/is unable to see what is under the surface.  \n\nAlso, all the extra work and tight deadlines are things that happened BECAUSE of underlying issues. Teammates not getting along, Utaha looking for validation, etc.  I mean, they're doing a new route because \"OMG THIS IS SO GOOD GUYS! THIS LAST MINUTE UTAHA ROUTE IS GOOD.  LET ME WRITE A THIRD ONE TOO BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I WANT! THE ART PERSON CAN MAKE THE EXTRA STUFF IN TIME.  I BELIEVE\".\n\nLike @ralphanese said, being a team leader is a delicate balance.  Right now MC treats team members like machines.  Considering he was the one who asked for help, I think that's pretty messed up.  The deadlines are self-imposed.  The game itself is mostly just important to him, and (maybe) Kato.  It's just one guy's dream indie game.  I don't feel like the stakes are nearly high enough to justify the way he is treating people who volunteered to help him.  Quite frankly the other members of his team were doing just fine with their own careers/lives without him.  This whole project is really for his benefit.\n\nSticking to deadlines is super important, but so are the people around you.  I'm really hoping the show finally points this out at some point.  MC wants to be a bad-ass director/producer but really he's just some kid bossing his friends around.  He's on the road to becoming that shitty boss nobody likes at work, who demands everything from you but doesn't give a shit otherwise."

Even if it means ruffling their feathers and staying on their ass to make sure something is done.\n\nThe issue with Tomoya is that he trusts too much and thinks too little of his deadlines. They keep getting extended at the behest of his creatives, and they're taking over the project.\n\nAs you said, he's sitting around, waiting for stuff to just fall into his lap. "

We've got this http://i.imgur.com/OOKJFX4.jpg shot of her with her arm broken, and then there's the terribly lazily animated shot of her running in the grass... or we could also talk about the legs in the shot of everybody in river, most points going to Izumi http://i.imgur.com/R7NhG2f.jpg...\n\nTo be honest, though, I like where they went with the art style for the OP; I thought it was quite pretty but badly done.

I love her so much.\n\nAnd when Eriri called him Tomoya in the classroom my heart skipped a beat.  They made her cuter and it made me root for her a bit more even if the blonde tsundere isn't really my thing.\n\nKato is getting the main heroine treatment it almost feels.  They give her different hairstyles at different lengths and clothes whereas Eriri and Utaha have generally static looks (ex Eriri with her hair down vs hair up and her in her uniform vs tracksuit) \n\nI'd love to see Utaha with some different hairstyles.\n\nThe art style was interesting for this episode.  I liked everybodys models but Tomoya's.   His just felt wrong, especially when Utaha and he were on the rooftop.\n\nThis series is making me have feels like crazy.  I'm said that it's moving so fast "
