Man, if you don't love her, be clear about it from the start. We can agree that Guri has been a big part of the problem, but the indecission from Seiji (which is compulsory taking into account he's the MC of a harem anime, even if it is a deconstruction of the harem genre) has been a crucial part of Guri turning dark. In fact, it serves as a parody of how most harems ignore that the indecission from the MC would inevitably lead to characters turning sour and depressed."
