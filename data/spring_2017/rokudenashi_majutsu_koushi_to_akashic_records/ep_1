It's still pretty dumb and bad in some spots, but I think it's better than where it started.\n\nRe;Creators, I think I can see where you're coming from.  In lieu of telling an interesting story with compelling characters, it delivers on an interesting premise by providing a narrative reason for various character archetypes to interact.  I don't think you could call it a deconstruction, but I think it's fair to call it \"meta\".  It then goes a little bit further by examining how those character archetypes might get along and influence each other if the characters were allowed to branch out a bit.\n\nI guess you could call it a gimmick, but I think it's one of the better shows this season.  BnHA, AoT, Kado, WorldEnd/Shuumatsu are my other picks, with the exception that the first half of AoT was pretty boring."

The whole \"haha your teammate happens to be in bad shape so guess you gotta look at that instead of finishing me off\" just feels like a cop-out, and in the end it just means you have to go back and defeat a guy who is already shown to be defeatable.  \n[](#nicoisdone)"

Sisti x Glenn is probably end game especially because Sisti seems to be the only one who is actually interested in him.\n\nOne of the better Magic battle high school shows I have watched. One where lead female mc wasn't an annoying ass bitch. Coming in to the show I actually thought I would have hated Sisti, but she turned out to be pretty adorable instead (Rumia still number one of main cast and blonde prof number one over all). Glenn was the high point of the show imo. Especially the episodes where he just fucks around were one of my favorites, although the serious episodes weren't too bad either. Enjoyable cast and enjoyable show. If i could read japanese I would probably pick up the LN. Now onto the next magic battle high school show of next season. Is there actually one this upcoming season?"

She's like the strongest mage, WHERE'S THE BLOODY BIKINI SCENE THEY PROMISED US!\n\n4 - Why wasn't Sistine's parents and family at the wedding? They didn't know Leos died - so what's their reasoning?\n\n5 - When did Sistine get so powerful? She was shown to be proficient in her magic, but not good enough to be able to stop an Executioner by herself.....the perfect deus ex machina.\n\n6 - The first half of the episode was promising, Glenn was actually taking the situation seriously.....but then the usual \"I will fight with you senpai\" trend starts and the quality of the episode drops fast.\n\nSeriously Glenn? You're laughing and joking around while fighting the guy who killed your previous lover....is that a smart decision?\n\nIs abandoning your custom weapons for your fists **really** the right call?\n\n7 - There were a million and one ways for Lowfan to get his fight with Glenn, why use Sistine? Kidnapping any one of his students would've given you the final result much quicker.\n\n8 - YAAAY, let's learn more about the mcguffin this series is named after.....only 10 minutes before the show ends. I still have no idea what the Akashic Records are, but they did reveal [that](/s \"HAHAHAHAHAHAA\")\n\nI like this show, but it ended with a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nThey've been hyping up Glenn's past while he was an executioner, only to disappoint us.\n\nI think Rokudenashi's director needs to go and watch Trigun to learn how to make a goofy/badass character work.\n\nThis show suffered from not having 2-cours....it was rushed beyond belief and you can especially feel it in the last few episodes. I loved the show and think it's one of the most enjoyable this season, but the last few episodes have been less than stellar.....and there's almost no chance of a sequel.\n\nI will miss Glenn's crazy antics.\n\n\n\n"

   "text": "Boy, that sure felt rushed. \n\nAnd turns out Leos doesn't even get a boss fight, as he was unceremoniously killed off and replaced in disguise by the real final boss Jatice since last episode while his carcass was left to rot.\n\nGlenn going all deadly-killer mode sure was badass as well, though it nearly [traumatized poor Sisty](https://i.imgur.com/0UXhFbH.png) until she got her shit together and ended up saving Glenn instead.\n\nIt's always good to see the heroine be a useful fighter alongside the male hero instead of being a useless damsel-in-distress. Sisty managed to dispel Jatice's spell more than once and disrupting his desired duel with Glenn, distracting him long enough so that Glenn can give him the Punch of Justice, twice. (I LOL'ed seeing him somehow end up in a [crucifixion stance](https://i.imgur.com/tq3LYzA.png) by chance)\n\nDespite being hyped as Glenn's supposedly badass master, Celica's screentime is criminally minimal in these 12 episodes, and so far, she's not done much to showcase her badassery.\n\nPS Rant: Upon realizing we may possibly not see a second season fills me with frustration. Just how much longer must the anime industry and fans in Japan put up with the practice of anime adaptations being treated as mere \"glorified commercials\" for the source manga and Light Novels by the book publishers?\n\nIt's like making only one season of Game of Thrones or only just adapt the first Harry Potter novel into a movie just to sell the books. Why can't they have more respect for the anime medium?"

More expensive and longer to make compared to LNs. Author writes stuff, editor edits it, some illustrations here and there, and you have a book you can sell. It's probably a more involved process but I think it takes more staff to make an anime. Surely there are some exceptions. In the movie side, there's kimi no nawa which had an international release. \n\nI don't have numbers but volumes of LNs probably earns more vs anime blu rays.

If it wasnt going to be an ad anime then they wouldnt have skipped so much. But ig they did their job as i cant wait til it comes out in english! As for the anime itself. The magic fight seemed good to me. Not too much anime clique yelling, not too crowed, not too spammy with spell calling. Fight was short and not drawn out for potential for more plot convenient event. Wish there is an OVA about celica or a histoey on akahic records or about glenn's class after the fight. I also have some questions. \n\n1. was sistine afraid of Glenn himself or was she afraid of the event unfolding before her eye and not Glenn himself but how he is reacting to it? \n\n2. Isnt the coat he is wearing IMC coat? Does that mean the class knows about it now? \n\n3. Official marriage and yet no parents show up. Wow. \n\n4. If No.11 can see/predict the future why hasnt he seen sistine? \n\n5. So has Glenn accepted that sistine isnt Sara? I have a theory and that is Glenn never saw sistine as sistine. But as a replacement of Sara. Thats why he kept calling her white cat since he called sara white dog. Is that a valid thing? "

I'll have my way in this comment because, reading the others, I don't think I'll get too downvoted ^^^^^please.\n\nOkay, first than all, I eat my words about Sistine being the most useless female lead I'd seen in a while, she DID SOMETHING, actually she was a bit too powerful at the end... Or maybe final boss (and his useless stand) was too weak.\n\nSpeaking of which, the whole thing with Jatice (whose name I will forget by tomorrow) was incredibly rushed and had no meaning at all.\n\n\"Hello, there, MY NAME IS blablablablabla\".\n\n \"Oh, yes, you were Imperial dude number 11! Justice!\".\n\n\"Indeed, AND MY GOAL IS TO blablablablabla Akashic Records (FINALLY) because I want to *blablablablabla intensifies*\"\n\n\"OH, so you are basically trying to do the same you did years ago, when you killed my ol' pal (we never got the flashback episode because she is literally a carbon-copy of Sistine). I THINK we have a problem here\" and the fight started.\n\nBut now I can't blame Sistine for being scared, our zombies (yes, we have zombies in a magic anime) were actually normal people, he and his imperial friends killed lots of people in those fights. BTW, we never got to know how the new dudes fight, or anything else about that mysterious dust that make people zombies. They definitely needed an episode 13.\n\nFunnily enough, I have no problem with how they treat woman and... The uniforms... Mostly because I came here with no expectations about that, I mean, it's a magical school battle harem.\n\nThis last episode screamed second season, which I would actually watch, because it was a funny ride. All things considered (and given that Tsugumomo was a 6 for me) this gets a 5/10."

Add to that a surprisingly interesting plot and you got one hell of a fun series. It still suffers some of the problems this genre faces in general (\"HURR DURR PERVERT\" jokes, and of course a cliffhanger ending), but this blows the rest of them out of the water otherwise.

The majority of the villains in this anime were either poor or laughable and were able to cheese their way in and out of situations (like really Glenn, you couldn't kill the main bad guy who you hate when he is vulnerable because Sistine needs to catch her breath?). \n\nThe comedy was sometimes on point, while at other times it substancially undermined the plot's more serious tones. Although there was some character development, it was sparse and only occasionally shone through the otherwise flat characters.

Get Glenn just one best girl (obviously Rumia, Sistine has been constantly jumping between good and terrible) and throw them into the heart of the Akashic Records plot without having to give each girl their own backstory arc.\n\nWhich I guess that's what Glenn's backstory is. Only one best girl contender and an engaging plot for the Imperial Court Mages to unravel. Give us a Fate/Zero-esque prequel please."
