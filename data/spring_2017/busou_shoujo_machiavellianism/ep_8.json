I love seeing more methodical fights like these even if it isn't as flashy as the fast-paced stuff that most action shows use.\n\nSatori looks like a lot of fun with her small but quick changing expressions in the OP.

And while calling your attacks is nice and all, they didn't need to do for every move.\n\nThis is just a thing in anime, since time immemorial. So it's kind of a take it or leave it kind of thing. It extends from the romantic notions of martial arts going back centuries and generations, where the naming, practicing, and mastering of [katas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata) are venerated and celebrated. Most Japanese fans eat this shit up. Personally, I think it's neat. It just wouldn't be anime without it."

Nomura's fight with the bear involved a bit more strategy and hilarious build-up than was shown, and, er... French girl's final move was more elaborate than just jumping down the stairs and magically winning. The point of the narration was to make sense of those silly situations, but the anime mostly employs it for useless exposition.\n\nThat said, I don't actually dislike it. It's got that really campy martial arts movie feeling to it, with everything somehow being derived from some ancient fighting style and infinite training, in order to achieve really shoddy choreography and special effects. I could imagine some really obvious harness holding up Warabi while she was doing her spinning attack. "

It would've been better if they went there from the start. \n\nThe power levels are kind-of correct. One of *the* Five Swords can deal with three shitty underlings, and two Minor Swords can sure Musou-slash 30 clones easily; sounds about right. I'd like a bit more of development from the Three Senpai Musketeers, tho.\n\nEven if it's funny to see everything being turned into an ougi, there's times when it's too much, the animation could at least improve and let those moments shine instead of using them as a tool.\n\nSomething about Satori as a wild card was pretty cool, and by other comments I'm hyped to see her fight. Waiting for next week! \n\nEdit: Forgot to mention, Satori's speech was coordinated with the OST, and that was beautiful, gave her an even more creepy aura."
