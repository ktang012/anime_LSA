Selestia's creator was the man of action here and he was only at the scene for like 2 minutes.

Meteora simply doesn't have any idea what's going on as she literally just arrived and was immediately attacked without being given a very good reason.\n\nRegardless, Alice wouldn't have cared (as she clearly didn't when Sota tried to explain that Magane spread lies in order for Alicetaria to becoming violent). Her character is the the stubborn, foolhardy hero in her world, and she hasn't changed a bit since coming into the world of the creators.\n\nSo, basically, saying that it's poor writing is just wrong. All of the issues you had were directly addressed in the episode, you may have just missed them.\n\nEDIT: As for Sota to simply say \"Altair did it\", he'd have to have time to explain why he knows this, and how he came about the knowledge in the first place (which he really didn't, Magane was the only person to hear Mamika's last words). Alicetaria isn't the type to just sit there and listen to some chump who's pretty useless (as pointed out by several characters already) when she could, and would, just act impulsively according to her character. \n\nI swear, every time I read the comment sections for this show it's like no one's actually paid attention, or just forgotten key plot elements from the beginning of the series. Instead it's just Meteora bashing because she talks too much, as if that's never happened in anime ever; especially considering her character is *literally an NPC librarian with nothing to do in her world but read and tell the hero the history of the world at the end of the game*. She's *supposed* to be long-winded, this isn't a writing flaw it's just keeping in tune with who she actually *is*. The same is to be said of *all* of the other creations, aside from Mamika who took it upon herself to change (and in the process found it to be incredibly difficult); it's what makes them infinitely more interesting than letting them change their personalities completely overnight."

Yes it is reasonable.You seem to be forgetting that these characters are not, and should bir, be extensions of the viewer. *Especially* Sota. You can't keep bashing a character for the *exact same reasons* that it's doing something within their range of abilities, that's novice level analysis.\n\nSota is a good protagonist. Not great, not terrible, just good. Why? Because he's *consistent*. Everything he's done up to this point has followed his own internal logic, and *that* makes a good character, not making one that serves you what you want when you want it because that's not what *people* do.\n\n>Uh, her character has changed drastically.

The problem here is that you're trying to rationalize a character's actions based on information only the audience possesses.\n\n First of all, are you kidding? She's literally stated she hasn't changed at all several times throughout the show. And constantly doubting others and going through some \"existential crisis\" fall sin line perfectly with her character in the book. Hell, she killed her own author for those exact reasons.\n\nAnd of course Aliceteria knows Maganae is lying. Alice specifically says she's doesn't care if it's the truth or not, because the only way to get through her grief is to have an \"enemy\" to blame. \n\nIn any case, I'm definitely not rationalizing Sota's behavior on information only the audience knows. I was stating that Magane is the only one who knows the truth, everyone knows she's a liar, but Alice just doesn't care anymore. The delivery from Sota certainly seemed out of character at first, but you have to remember that he keeps constantly thinking he's useless and powerless, so when something Selesia gets stabbed through the torso *that's* when adrenaline kicks in, and you have no idea what you're capable of on an adrenaline high.\n\n>If Alice wouldn't have listened then that's on her.

You can't look at anyone and tell them that made sense.\n\nWhat? Sorry, none of that makes any sense. Alice didn't listen because *she didn't want to* because Meteora is a much easier target. Sota not saying anything? He literally explained Magane's entire plot to Alice, who still didn't care. This isn't forced conflict, this is conflict through ideals. And there's *major* differences between the two, so don't throw out some phrase you heard about but never really learned what it actually is.\n\nForced conflict would be if, for no god damn reason, Magane lied to Alice who then proceeded to attack Meteora the, not acting confused when Sota runs into to stop her, and to take it a step further she *certainly* would not have had that expression on her face when she stabbed Selesia. Forced conflict is the Buu Arc of DBZ and entirety of DBGT. *This* is not forced conflict.\n\nAnd to assume that someone on their last legs, their literal death-bed if you will, can think straight, see straight or even speak coherently is ludicrous.The blood loss alone would make you bonkers. It made total sense, seeing as how Magane was the one who saw her flying in the first place.\n\nAs for why she's always places first, the author (Hiore) states even he doesn't understand why she's always at the right place at the right time. He feels it intensifies the mystery surrounding her. While I both disagree and agree with this line of thinking, the only way the plot could have moved forward would be if someone like Manage found Mamika. If anyone else had found her, the conflict would be over, end of story. *That's* terrible writing.\n\nAlso, \"listening\" and \"hearing\" are two separate things. Everything Sota said went in one ear and out the other with Alice, who is personally undergoing her own mental break. Besides, we have no idea if \"Altair\" is even known to Alice as her name, she's never once called her that. Saying \"Altair did it\" would make zero sense in context and would just be ham-fisted writing,\n\nWhile these are anime characters, the direction they've taken them has been to make them feel more *human* than any other characters before. Not even *KATO* has succeeded at that, whereas *Re: Creators* has succeeded extremely well in this aspect considering the massive amount of exposition needed to get it right in the first place.\n\nAnd if you think Alice was coherent *at all*, you clearly did not see her face the entire episode.\n\nEDIT: I realized something when talking about Meteora being Exposition-chan, and why there's so much misinformation in the episode threads: You all didn't listen, it just went in one ear and out the other because you found it boring. All of her dialogue during her massive exposition dump explains practically *everything* people seem to not understand. While I agree just using Meteora for the exposition was slightly annoying, but that's just who she is: the person who only exists to deliver massive exposition in the game. This isn't a show for people with ADHD, clearly, but all of the exposition that we went through in the first five or so episodes was absolutely necessary to form the world's basic structure of how things will and won't work. And then I see, literally every episode, people bitching about something that just can't happen because of the exposition I actually paid attention to.\n\nApologies to those that *did* listen to Metora but still can't figure things out. Meteora just gave the show its boundaries, but there's also a lot more to gain just from how characters' reaction to certain situations that end up explaining how they think and feel. This is key, as the characters almost never talk about themselves - aside from Sota and his internal monologues. This show requires people to *pay attention* to the little things, the details tucked away, as they're the real fascinating plot and character  points.\n\n"

She literally shouldn't exist at all because of her word-play power which only works if the story wants it to work. Most of the characters can just fight her without talking to negate her reality bend, but you know what? The story won't be that logical (you can literally google her weaknesses in thier world). \n\nMost people don't like watching shows that show the intrinsic human condition with all of its flaws, I certainly don't (really disliked NGE, but loved the 2.0 movie to bits).  \n\nNow Altair's reason for destroying the world is really petty and revenge can be petty, the reason is still unreasonable though. \n\nAnd the whole Magane finding Mamika is so damn cliche and the friend believing the villain to fight the good guys. This is really bad writing as it was so predictable. Also there wasn't any detail of what happened at the site of the explosion. And the plot holes. How did Magane find out where her author lived? Same with Alice-chan. These popular authors tend to be elusive and these characters just find them so damn easily. Now I don't understand why Magane wasn't put down like a rabid dog is anyone's guess. She is clearly a murderer and should be tailed by secret service members and maybe sniped from range. I am not sure of her combat and supernatural abilities, but she did jump and move pretty quickly though. \n\nAnd this episode with no one telling Alice what the hell was going on. Bad writing. If Souta said \"Altair killed Mamika\" and Alice still didn't question her motives than it would be more believable that she is in shock and just wants to hate, but not saying that shows how bad the writing is. Literally a normal person would have said \"I believe Altair was behind her death\" and Souta is pretty damn plain normal person. If I as a viewer feel that the plot conveniently omit information that would otherwise change the outcome in a natural way than there is a problem with the writing - the plot just doesn't feel organic. This show can be compared to Steins;Gate with how much meta exposition it has in it, but the quality of the writing is drastically different between the two. Maybe this will pick up mid season just like in Steins;Gate. \n\nThis show started out so well, but the writing and over all plot scream Aldnoah Zero level of bullshit. Funny thing is this dude made Fate/Zero and Aldnoah Zero so I try to stick it out as Fate/Zero was really good. \n\nNow that I think about it you can probably see the uncanny similarities of some of the characters in this anime compared to Fates series.

Altair with her retarded revenge speech and motive. Alice with her anti-intellectual ego. Magane with anti-narrative powers. Souta hiding critical information when he calmly told Mamika. Yuuya fighting like an idiot when he was clearly one of the most competent characters earlier on in the show.\n\nBasically the elements that I didn't pick up on might as well not exist at all or are so contrived and trivial as to be un-interesting and not very important. There can be plot holes if the plot is interesting enough to bulldoze pass them. \n\nI even said in my post to you that this show might be the same as Steins;Gate in that in the second part of it, it will be very good.

I feel as if Souta's conflict is holding the whole show back and it would have been better without it. There really isn't much emotional investment in this show. \n\nAlso as I post all of it is my opinion and I really do believe this to be bad writing as I just do not care very much for the conflicts at all. Mamika's death was utterly cliche and I hate the director for using her death like that to push the story. There should have been a better way. Same thing with making Alice extremely irrational. "

The mechanics of rewriting, the nature of fictional characters in our world and the issues with their descriptions and their memories of their backstories were supposed to be a central part of the plot. They did give a lot of exposition for that, so I hoped they had all planned.\n\nI mean, if what they decided to include was just *\"ok, to save Selesia let's use the power up from episode 3 instead of having Matsubara make up a new one\"*, it's all cool.

I doubt anyone actually writes as it goes along since anime production is complicated and you're make a shitton of episodes at the same time\n\nEvangelion for example, at some point it needed to start scratch an plot point in the middle of the series due to an terrorism act on a subway station on japan, and if you read the initial series plan, a lot of things would be different, but in the end we got our Evangelion that somehow worked and even had an ending that totally tells 200.00% planned from start.\n"

There are still some points that really irk me, such as Sota and Meteora having a large conversation in front of Alice, yet only mentioning *once* that Meteora didn't kill Mamika (*albeit, Alice probably knows, but is too prideful as a character to change her mind*).\n\nAltair seems to be able to manipulate the creations, but to a certain extent. I feel that her mimicing the Mecha was a bit of a waste on her end, but it proves just how powerful the Mecha will be, since it seemed to use up a lot of her powers.\n\nFinally, we also get to see creators having an effect on their creations. The fact that Selesia's creator could make a change to her character brings some questions to the table, but it also confirms something: Creators are very important, as they seem to be the only thing that can keep a creation intact. This makes me think that with Meteora, Magane, and Altairs creators being deceased, if they ever do die, there is no coming back. But I guess we will find out more with Selesia's situation next episode.\n\n**I swear, if the writers do anything to my sweet, sweet Selesia...**\n\n[](#modabuse)"

Her agency as an individual is confined to how she was written and these shortcomings are harsher/deeper than just being prideful or in some way flawed as a character. It could be that they are literary lacking parts of a real human. Mamika, for example, was horrified when she actually hurt someone when she used her powers for the first time. That was something she didn't know could happen because it just didn't happen in her world."

Their default state is to behave like they are used to. In that regard it seems like the antagonists are kept away from real people (to be easier manipulated) while our protagonists creations interact and work with real humans and adapt (and become less \"archetypical characters\" and more human)."

If a fight is necessary, I understand Superman going hand to hand because he doesn't know about kriptonite. But once he has been affected by the gas grenade and loses his powers temporarely, he should have flown and attack Batman using his lasers. There is a moment in which SM regains his strength yet he continues the fight\n\n3. Batman just sets up the spear without having no way of knowing that the fight would end up close to it\n\n4. Superman knew when Lois Lane was thrown of the building, yet he didn't know about his own mother being kidnapped.\n\n5. Lex brings Martha to Metropolis/Gotham instead of keeping her as far away as possible in case Batman switched teams\n\n6. Lex had no way of knowing the result of the fight. There were no cameras, drones or anything. And if you say that there were they were just not shown, how did he not order his mercenaries to kill Martha after Batman and Superman become friends?\n\n7. No one calls his mother Martha. In fact, if it weren't for the freaking mother of all coincidences, Batman should have no reaction to a random name. If Superman had said \"save my mom\" and we got flashbacks to Batman's mother it would have made way more sense.\n\n8. Batman thinks Superman is dangerous and has to be killed at all costs. Him having loved ones doesn't change anything about that. Even bad guys want to protect their loved ones. SM having some humanity doesn't change anything.\n\n9. Related to point 8, Batman doesn't even consider the fact that it could be a trap that SM says to save himself.\n\n10. Batman knows who Superman is, therefore he should know that Martha Kent is SM's mother. That's not a secret. Batman is a detective, he would have at least check Clark's Facebook\n\n11. Batman has the element of surprise with the kriptonite and completely wastes it. The initial machine gun should have had kriptonite bullets for an insta win. \n\n12. Lex's plan.

I watched it on an 8 hour flight a year ago)\n\nThe spear set up is possibly a \"Batman Gambit\" thing though. It's kind of his *thing*.\n\nThere are plenty of scenes that will also crumble against this level of scrutiny, and I agree that Lex was a pretty bad villain, but I just don't think this scene was the shortcoming of the movie. The scene was fine, and I just hate the criticism it gets. It's the kind of joke people make when they don't even know the context.\n\nA similar one is the \"7.8/10, too much water\". The game had too many water Pokemon. It was a valid criticism. It seriously limited the ability of a number of Pokemon because there was a lack of variety. Or when people criticise the casting for Ghost in the Shell when in reality it was the villain (And boring cinematography) that made it suck."

Maybe the tweet made the fans think about Selesia in how cool it would look animated, and thus Selesia from the Anime got the powerup.

I haven't gotten round to reading the webcomic, so the Saitama written by the author himself doesn't really exists to me.\n\nApply this to a wide enough audience, and there will be the specific interpretation of the character that is the most popular - it could be the anime (that should expose the work to an international audience more easily), it could be the manga, it could be the original webcomics, or it could be a book / LN.

Magane, on the other hand, seems be be limited only by her imagination and responses from others, which may eventually threaten the integrity of reality at the pace she keeps using and abusing her skills.\n\nBTW, I wonder if Magane saw and understood the stunt Selesia's author pulled - that could turn into a nasty tool in her hands..."

   "text": "Okay, this episode has **almost** killed any of my further interest in the show for the sheer amount of blatantly irrational and idiotic things these characters are choosing to do. You can argue \"they're fictional anime characters, they're meant to be stupid\" all you want, but that would be even worse, since the show is trying to play this nonsense straight.\n\nAlicetaria believing Magane over Souta and Meteora and COMMON FUCKING SENSE, is the last straw in her idiotic scarecrow. Her whole ridiculous resolve in avenging someone based on the testimony of a psychopath is not dramatic, it's idiotic. If the testimony came from someone respectable, sure, but does she have an IQ of like...20 or something?\n\nThen we have Yuuya, I don't know if he legitimately wanted to give Magane his persona-thingy, but up until now he's been the most competent person in the series (besides maybe Meteora) and suddenly he forgets how fighting works and even after being told that the only way Magane can do anything is if he talks to her he falls into that trap again? If stupid is dynamite, that moment was an atomic bomb.\n\n**AND THEN** what was that Deus Ex Machina bullshit pulled at the end?! First we have Selesia going god-mode, but only for a moment because apparently the writers would be aghast if she had any fucking major role to play in this conflict, then Altair just fucks off because \"oh, it's not ripe yet\". She might as well have looked at her watch and said \"WAIT GUYS! There's more episodes to go! We have to retreat so we don't win and so the good guys can't earn anything themselves!\"\n\nI'll keep watching because the set-up for this had set me at high hopes, but this was astronomically terrible, in my opinion. For a show that is all about writers and their creations (particularly with Selesia's Creator ranting about useless cliche bullshit) it sure seems to pretend it can get away with the useless cliche bullshit."

Throughout the series we can see how desperate to fix it, to the point of believing Altair due to her promise of a simple solution. The same applies to the previous two episodes. When she lost Mamika, she was desperate to find her killer and avenge her, to the point of listening to Megane. Mamika told her to listen to Megane right before dying, so what other choice did she have? Even though she might know how that Megane is deceitful, in her eyes, Megane has to be right, otherwise she doesn't know how to express her grief since she wouldn't know Mamikas killer. You can see that in her face when she wad facing Sofa.\n\nAs for Yuuya, I'm pretty sure Megane already cursed him once, which stopped him attacking her with his sword as he would hit himself, so he couldn't fight to his full potential. But his character has been shown to be cocky and to not shy away from a fight so it's not unreasonable that he would continue to talk to Megane throughout the fight.\n\nYou have to take into consideration that they're mostly clich\u00e9s fictional characters brought to the real world,  so they will act irrationality and dumb cause that's how they were made. You cant ignore that. \n\nBut yeah the whole thing with Selestia was a bit bs, but I presume they'll explain why it was only temporary."

   "text": "Okay, in regards to your points:\n\n1. Magane never actually said SHE didn't kill Mamika, and even if we ignore why Alice suddenly decided to not blame her for the death the question has to be asked that if she still is searching for somewhere to point her anger and grief, why did she not merely ask \"Then who killed Mamika?!\" when Souta was talking to her? Why didn't anyone directly ask or answer any of the accusations in that scene? Souta talked about her experiences, and she got completely sidetracked by her hatred of humanity rather than what was supposed to be consuming her in the scene. The entire thing was inconsistent, and they didn't create any reason why they wouldn't be able to discuss anything. Meteora even says \"we must reach an understanding\" but then literally says nothing to Alice for that whole encounter. It's not the situation of Meteora being framed that is necessarily unconvincing, it's the way it has been playing out, with no one acting within their character for the sake of convenience.\n\n2. Yuuya being cocky and not shying away from a fight has basically nothing to do with him continuing to talk to her. Talking isn't fighting. And the fact that she cursed him already is exactly why he shouldn't have fallen for it. His response to her suddenly being immune to his wind-technique should've been to focus more on his swordplay, to pull a strange gambit that would mitigate her evasive acrobatics. Literally ANYTHING ELSE than what he did would have been a smarter decision with the information he was given. He's not just supposed to be a cocky fighter, he's supposed to be a good fighter, hence why he is the final boss in his game. He's meant to be an incredibly adversary, and considering that just a moment before he fell into the trap he shouts \"You never shut up!\" shows that his character shouldn't hinge of verbal communication during a fight, he's been almost dead silent in almost every other engagement.\n\n3. Finally, I already addressed the \"they're cliche characters brought to life\" argument for horrifying plotholes. It doesn't work because the writers of the show made that decision consciously which shows their laziness and if anything is a cynical excuse, **and** the show tries to play these situations off as organic and dramatic. If the show is so self-aware of its fictitious characters being idiots, why are the real people who created them or leading the government ever comment on it or try to intervene with some logic? It's an excuse, not a justification."

   "text": "The episode brings into light most of the cast's personalities.\n\n\nAlice for one is akin to Demona of Gargoyles. Both suffered injustice but commit the same injustice as well later using their dark pasts to justify their actions. However when put in situations where clearly they were in the wrong, they did accept but continued their vendetta as its the only they have left. However, this reached to the climatic scene where Alice began to ask herself \"What she has done!\" She wasn't a knight anymore.\n\n\nYuya's case is his relationship with Hangaku. If there is any truth from Magane, Yuya's relationship might be a forced one. Yuya did say that he was on the run and many of those he was close to were hurt in the process. Hagane might be one of the reasons he developed this personality we know today and his lashing out at his Creator. It's unknown how Yuya is feeling after Hangaku is no longer with him but this is a future he must take up on and find a path that wasn't meant for him.\n\n\nMost of Sota's life has always centered around Setsuna's death. However thanks to the events that have occured, Sota finally realized that his chance has appeared. While he wasn't Meteora's God but he represented what opinions Meteora had regarding her late Creator, someone who really loves the work he has created and those that live in it. You could even say that in Meteora's eyes, her father was there to protect her.\n\n\nCorrelating with the recent one, Selesia's relationship with her Creator and because of it, it proves the theory that was mentioned many episodes ago. By gaining support from others, the power was granted. However, I also believed that Selesia's Creator recent power was the result of both fans and his fatherly love for Selesia.\nWhile the episode left off with most of our heroes injured but there was an opportunity discovered. Meaning when they recovered, our heroes are better prepared for future battles ahead."

   "text": "Okay, after watching this episode, two things happen that change the story a little bit:\n\n1) Altair uses powers that we have never seen before and she starts fading when she uses her powers too much. Then she decides to retire after Selesia transforms and attacks.\n\n2) Selesia gets the power up/special attack that her creator and illustrator created during the episode 03, this time the new attack actually works and Selesia attacks Aliceteria, but the transformation doesn't last and then she returns to her previous aspect and the wound didn't recover.\n\nAbout the first one, Altair is a \"well-made secondary creation\" of Shirotsumekusa, a character from a mobile/social game. She's not just a fanfiction or a doujin, she's a secondary version of that character, but with an original story. \n\nDuring episode 08, Marine (the illustrator of Selesia's novel) said an important thing: \"Saying they're different characters isn't totally accurate. Altair is a well-made secondary creation. A lot of secondary creations are just parodies, but a secondary creation with a plot that goes past the original story sometimes gets accepted as a separate story in it's own right.\"\n\nMinutes later, Meteora says: \"Although they do share a common base, the traits that define them as characters, their personalities and goals, have diverged, and Altair is very different from Shirotsumekusa, an icon with no backbone. This change caused the worlds to separate, and the new world of Altair gained the recognition of others and Altair's world was established as a completely independent world.\"\n\nWith this, we totally know that Altair is not exactly a fanfiction, she changed a lot from the original character and got the recognition of other people online. Because of that, a new world was created with his version. I think we have to clarify this before creating new theories about her.\n\nWe still don't know how she got out of her world, what is her story or how she entered the other character's worlds, but we know that she wants to revenge her creator, Setsuna (who is apparently a friend of Sota), and destroy the real world. I personally think that she retreated from the battle because she caused too much changes in the real world, and that the collision of the two worlds was causing her disappearance. She retreated because she would have disappeared if she continued using her powers. But that's just my opinion, I can't wait for next week's episode to get more answers.\n\nAbout Selesia, during episode 03, they met Marine and Meteora decides to do an experiment to know how much the creators can affect the created. They created Selesia's new attack: Matsubara wrote context for the new attack and Marine drew the illustration we saw during this episode. \n\nThe attack doesn't work, and that's not because of the lack of information by the creators, it's because they're missing something else. That's Meteora's conclusion after the experiment, but then, Sota says something interesting:\n\n\"It might me the impression. Mirokuji was talking about it today\". (Remember that during this episode they met Mirokuji) \"He said he thinks the reason why he appeared in this world is because he left a lasting impression on many people. Isn't revising the story the same? It has to leave AN IMPRESSION ON THE READERS AND THE FANS IN ORDER TO BE ACCEPTED.\" Then Matsubara answers: \"Hmm.... You're talking about how readers have to be able to identify with the story.\"\n\nWith this we know for sure that if the Creators write new things about the character (the creation) and add new information or characteristics, it's not enough to affect the creation in the real world. It has to leave an impression on the readers and the fans. During this episode, the attack/power up worked when Matsubara posted the illustration of Selesia using the attack and wrote something like \"Guys, Selesia is getting a new attack during the next volume!\". That tweet caused impact on the readers and the fans of Vogelchevalier, it left an impression on the readers and the fans and they recognized that new aspect of the character, that's why it worked this time. \n\nBut the problem is it only worked during a couple of minutes, and it healed Selesia completely. I think that when Matsubara posted the tweet and the illustration, he created a \"new version\" of Selesia that the fans recognized, that's why she kinda transformed to a new character, with different clothes and weapon (because remember that Marine designed her with new clothes and a new sword), and that's why the wound disappeared. The transformation worked because it got the recognition of the fans and the readers. \n\nBut a couple of minutes later, she returned to her previous state. My conclusion is that the new aspect/attack of Selesia got the recognition of the fans when Matsubara posted that, but it didn't last because it was just a tweet, something momentary that didn't actually happened in the story, it hasn't actually been made concrete in the novel, but the people who saw the tweet and the illustration recognized the new attack, and that recognition actually lasted enough in the fans to be true, to be something new about the character, and that caused the transformation of Selesia. \n\nSuddenly a lot of people's perception of the character changed, making the change true in the real world, but it's not a version included in the story, so it didn't last. Also, when she returned to her previous state, she still has the wound because, as I mentioned before, the transformation changed her body/aspect to a new character design, but she quickly returned to her previous state with the wound, she returned to the \"original character\".\n\n\nI hope this text makes sense xd. This anime is actually so interesting, with a lot of character development, good soundtrack and great battles. And with this episode the first part ended, I'm pretty excited to watch the next episodes and see what will happen.\n"

Why repeat what she was going to say when Magane can tell her the whole message which Mamika would have died before telling Alice.\n\n* The blood from Mamika literally fell onto Magane's food, that's pretty easy to tell how she'd find her. Unless you're referring to the actual probability of Mamika flying over Magane, which is simply plot convenience and is not a bad thing on its own, as what followed caused the plot to moved forward. \n\n* Yes because Alice knows how to use the kind of technology to look up that information. As far as we know she hadn't interacted with anyone that would inform her of such things. And following that point why wouldn't she believe Magane? To Alice, those aren't Magane's words but Mamika and she will obviously those, she has no reason not to, yea?\n\n* This point can relate to the one just mentioned, she attacked them because she believed Mamika had been killed by Meteora, to Alice that's literally what Mamika's message was, that she was killed by Meteora. And if you look at Alice's character & story, it's easy to see why she is so hard-headed and simple in her train of thought. She was a warrior who lived in a horrible world where death was everywhere.\n\n* You do know he caused a close friend to commit suicide out of his own jealous emotions? You do realize just how much that would fuck someone up, nonetheless a kid? The amount of guilt, regret, and shame he feels is enormous, the fact that you think he'd be A-OK afterwards and not feel anguish whenever he even thinks of her, nonetheless having to face a physical representation of that friend's creation, all the while having this immense pain inside of himself because of what he did to said friend, is honestly sad on your end.\n\n* He did tho? And it's not like he was aware of what happened to Mamika either so all he can do is defend a friend who he believes didn't kill her.\n\n* So a military princess that wields a sword and tommy gun like a violin, can fly, can summon an insane amount of swords, and can copy (which we don't even know if that was an exact copy or what) objects, seems like cheese to you? Well lol, that's because it is, it's an oc that some girl made so of course it's going to be some badass character.\n\n* Well considering that we know Selesia's series are very popular, and that twitter is a widely used platform. You'd think a tweet by the creator about a never before seen version of her would gain a lot of attention and popularity, no? Just imagine if someone like Togashi or Oda posted a panel of their mangas on twitter, shit would be getting a lot of attention. So who's to say something like that can't happen in that instance?\n\n* I hope you're not referring to the part where Altair was literally about to disappear, thus nulling her plans, if she continued to be there? It's already been alluded to that a gathering of all these characters wasn't going to be good, this time it seemed that along with summoning a mech, this caused quite the strain on her. So if anything, it's easy to see why she pulled out of the fight.\n\n* I'd think it to be rather difficult when they don't run into each other that often, besides this show has so far shown no emphasizing factor on the tactics of each fighter aside from their general skills/powers.\n\nAnd no worries, I look forward to your response.

   "text": "Okay yes, sorry I misunderstood your first point. I agree with that assessment, but seeing as Magane was already on their radar for killing two people it still doesn't make sense to me that no one, not even knowledge-obsessed Meteora, would then bother to see what her powers are ASAP.\n\nI don't have time to respond to every point response, but in regards to the first bullet point: Beginning-of-the-story Mamika would have trusted Magane; not the one we saw develop over the last ~7-8 episodes. She had learned and accepted that our world had consequences and bad people in it. She tried to make one last appeal to Altair's goodness and got stabbed; that should have been the last straw for trusting OBV evil people, if nothing else. \n\nSo they took the most developed char so far, killed them off, and then had them behave as if they never got any development at all so that an easily resolvable plot point is dragged out artificially longer than it needs to take.\n\nIf it doesn't bother you that's totally fine and valid, but misunderstandings and dumber-than-normal characters for the sake of keeping a too-simplified-to-last-22-episodes plot going artificially when they should have just put more thought/effort into writing the original plot/conflict to begin with is a massive, **massive** turn off for me when watching a show. Kills investment in the story, the characters, and the confidence that the writers remotely know what they're doing.\n\nRegarding your points about Sota: I mean, yes I agree he must have some emotional baggage, but... by being such a bitch about just telling everyone AT LEAST who Altair is and what she wants to do, he has now directly caused the death of Mamika as well, and caused Meteora to be viciously beaten and Selesia to be killed or nearly-killed. At this point his actions, in my opinion, have moved into disgustingly selfish territory. If he has come clean at the start I bet they would have praised him for it. Now they'll hate him because of all the bullshit he let happen on his conscience.\n\nLastly, regarding your point about the Selesia resurrection, I don't doubt a post like that *would* get millions for retweets/likes.... but not in the span of 10-15 seconds in the middle of the night... especially when the news must ostensibly be playing a breaking story about a bunch of unexplained explosions and gunfire in the heart of the city (that part is mostly a joke lol).\n\nAnyway, I really appreciate your response and sorry if I came off as contentious earlier. I have to go to work though so I don't have time to hit any other points :/"

   "text": "In terms of Mamika and Magane I think it was moreso Mamika just hoping for her to tell Alice the truth, I don't think Mamika was expecting Alice to show up before she did, and while I will agree with all the points you made, I wouldn't say Magane is ultimately evil, I think she's more of a chaotic character who just does whatever she thinks is going to be fun. Of course I personally think she's evil but in terms of what she intended to be I don't think it's outwardly evil.\n\nI assume with this second point you're referring to Mamika again, I don't want to sound repetitive so I think what I stated above can translate here as well. She just wanted to to get the info out, wasn't sure Alice was going to show up, had no choice but to tell Magane, etc,etc. And while it is being dragged out I think that's exactly what Magane wants to happen, she just wants to see destruction and chaos occur.\n\nOh I agree, if they could do other things instead of what they have done I'd be all for, I'm just not going to stress about what we've been given. Sure I would love to see more locations and maybe even going into the other character's worlds but you have to work with what ya got.\n\nI think they've pretty much discovered who Altair is, the only other thing Sota could contribute is why she is doing what she's doing, which I expect to be explained in some form sooner or later, and how she came about. And I doubt anyone is going to hate him for this, Meteora has already alluded to the fact that she knows the truth, and I don't see Selesia, Mech boy, Purple persona man really giving him a hard time for it. Especially if it all comes out in a rather dramatic way when he tells them the whole story behind her. The only one I could see having an issue is FBI chick but I don't know what exactly she could do. As far as we know, he doesn't seem to have any information about Altair's weakness so how much info, aside from that which I've mentioned could he have? I'm not sure.\n\nThat's true, it does seem slightly unlikely but I believe they did add a moment of nothing happening after they put it out there to express some time had passed before she changed forms.\n\nAnd that's fine, no worries."

Literally all every Creation and \"Human\" is acting as intended naturally. You can't expect a character like Yuuya to *suddenly* be Out-of-Character when it's literally Engraved in his description.\n\nAlso no one seems to be taking into account of Alice's point of view. She's being manipulated by Master manipulators, found out her Friend *Just Died* and is being challenged what by *she* knows a character from a story and a knight with a knight's mentality. Just because she didn't say out loud that she's evolving like the other Creations doesn't mean it's not Visible that she is. \n\nAnyway, the episode had some amazing development for... well, everything, Meteora's theory was confirmed but only slightly, and we got to see what else Altair could and couldn't do.\n\nI don't know about everyone else, but I'm enjoying this show and staying patient with what it gives out every week. It always manages to be meta in the best of ways and since Magane said that's the end of part 1 I can't wait to see what part 2 will be like.\n\nAll in all, at least this show's first half wasn't as Boring as Fate/Zero's when it came to the dialogue-heavy episodes"

Blitz and Alice are the only creations with no known weakness (yet) that are on the opposing side, with Magane being a wild card and Alice in a confused state of mind. The government already has Blitz' **Creator** in their custody, they don't need to look up shit on him if she's already there. They also have **Sota** and **Meteora** to help with Alice & Magane. And in case you haven't noticed, Both Blitz & Alice seem to very knowledgeable of combat and are thus very hard to kill without the help of the Creations on their side. \n\nThe whole point of meeting the Creator was so they **didn't** have to do some stupid Google search (as well as other reasons).

Also, even if Souta told Alice, do you honestly think she would've listened? You're not considering her state of mind at all given the fact that she's a Creation. Yuuya is a **Creation**, of course he's going to screw up  when you consider what kind of character he's based on. He was competent earlier when he **wasn't** in a fight or being annoyed. Him fighting Magane was bad match-up for him, plain & simple.\n\n> Military doesn't even shoot or try to snipe the enemy characters.\n\nWould they even be able to? They're Creations, not Humans. It maybe possible, it may not. To me, it seems like the only to kill a Creation is with *another* Creation. We'll just have to wait & see whether that's not the case.\n\n> Selesia power up was not ex machina at all. 65,000 + likes under 5 seconds. This is considered popular enough to manifest powers?\n\nDid you miss the part where it was mentioned that it was Temporary? Pretty sure that was stated. You clearly don't know how fast the Internet can react to something popular. Also, Meteora **theorized** this earlier in the show, so clearly it was foreshadowed.\n\n> This show pretty much isn't appealing to my tastes and I wan't to complaining about it without sparing a second thought to what's happening.\n\nThere FTFY"

Not-saber, after being nearly defeated and forgotten about during the final fight, swoops in during the climax of the fight between the big bads sacrificing her life to kill Shark Face, surprising her and making her say some cool 1 liner like \"where... did you come from...\" as she gets the business end of the spear through her baby maker and Not-saber saying something like \"I did it... Mamika...\" then dieing.  PRINT THAT.  \n\nThis series has been so damn enjoyable.

Although Magane has temporarily gained a new power, it might come back to bite her later depending on the potential side effects of being that stand's owner. Since she haven't read his novel, this might become another hidden land mine like Alice's spear. \n\n2. Besides the fact that Alice came from a specific type of story, there's another justification for her actions that I have been thinking ever since the bridge fight. Alice feels like how Kiritsugu from Fate/Zero acts when he first find out the existence of the holy grail. She has a goal that is impossible to achieve within her ability: for her people to live a happy life. Her hope has been killed by the brutality of her world. Suddenly, Altair appears and offers a way to fix everything, reverse death, and bring peace to her land. This is the only way for her wish to come true, so she keeps believing in it because that is the only way to keep her hope afloat. She WANTS the lie to be true. The same theory sort of applies to her reaction towards Mamika's death. She wants Meteora to be the true murderer because she wants to have someone to point fingers to for her to cope with Mamika's death. The reason why she is so easy to push around is because she wants to not let herself know that she is being pushed around. "

It was almost like she never killed a human, or believed that none of the Creations counted as humans, based on wiping the blood off her face. Zero satisfaction from her actions.\n\nWhat is the extension of Altair's abilities? Presumably she is the one who intervened by dissolving Selesia's sword in a flurry of petals, right? She also was able to minic the kid's mech. ~~Initially, during the episode, I thought she had the ability to spawn and/or manipulate the Creations' existences, but then there's no logic behind that, right?~~\n\nAnd for a brief comment in regards to Selesia's temporary power-up (and healing). The reason the changes became reality is due to her new design being publicized via social media. That said, because these changes are not universally accepted (impressed on the masses), that's the reason the revived Selesia is only temporary. Or at least I'm assuming."

Hangaku could be seen by everyone.\n\n2) In general, Stand users let the Stands fight for them. Yuuya uses a special bouktou instead of relying on Hangaku for everything. \n\n3) Hangaku was stolen from him this episode by Magane. Stand users die if they lose their Stands.\n\n4) Hangaku is also a famous historical figure, not named after any sort of musical allusion. This fits every Persona to a T as they are all based on real myths, heroes, legends, and monsters.\n\n5) In his intro he's mentioned he's from a *game*. He's said to be from a manga later, but there's a shit ton of manga based off games and the like, so that's not really a major issue.\n\n6) It may have cross-promotional appeal due to the recent release of Persona 5, but that's a long shot.\n\nIf you can't see that it's not a stand after all that, I don't know what to say. It's so blatantly obviously based off Persona it's like it's slapping you in the face."

I was expecting him to bring up his conversation with Mamika at that point. There isn't enough emphasis on how no one realised the stories were real - it wouldn't mean much to Aliceteria, but for the creators and audience, dark stories are supposed to be a safe way to experience things precisely because they are made up. It's also funny that Souta says people want to be moved by her virtue when her personal qualities are causing her to act in a way that isn't that respectable. We haven't seen enough of her being good and respectable in a way one wants to emulate for his words to resonate. It only means something because we can bring our experiences from other stories.\n\nWe don't know enough about Yuuya to see what it means to have his \"curse\" stolen but Magane having an offensive ability with a side effect she doesn't understand, and Yuuya losing something he claimed was unwanted, has various interesting possibilities. Despite that, I liked having a villain whose main power was talking and it would be a disappointment if she puts less emphasis on it. Parts of her speech made me expect that people are soon going to properly look each other up and get to know each other's personalities, powers, and stories though. With this much intel on everyone else available it's just irresponsible not to.\n\nAltair bringing out random powers is really unsatisfying, even if it's something you might expect from a fan-creation by a teenage amateur. I preferred her tossing swords around. It's darkly humourous for Matsubara to claim Altair couldn't win because she was created by someone inferior as a creator - even though it is no doubt true - when said creator is Souta's former friend who committed suicide, while Souta was right there. I wanted to see Souta's face.\n\nSelesia's powerup went the only way it could have (obviously they'd reuse the design previously shown, and obviously it would be temporary or the possibilities of powerups would be too extreme unless they killed all the creators) and we knew that it would likely be tied to people's cognition of the creations, but I didn't expect her to be badly injured at the time. She hasn't had enough character development to be allowed to die here but there was a brief moment where I entertained the idea of both female protagonists dying. Like we saw in in the first episode, injuries inflicted by Selesia's sword don't bleed, which is weird considering that even Mamika drew blood."

   "text": "So, on the topic of Selesia's power up... I'm going to throw in my hypothesis which is likely a retread.  \n\nSo, we've seen that the most well known and popular iterations of the various characters appear.  Meteora from her VN. Selesia from her anime, but not the light novel or manga. Etc.\n\nTheir existence/manifestation are taken from the most widely or popular known collective belief of their various IPs.  My hypothesis being proven right when Selesia's new powers and drawing alone weren't what gave her the ability.  It was the posting on social media and the public response and collective admiration/belief that fueled her getting that form. \n\nSo, It's pretty clear that its collective belief that not only fuels their existence, but that grounds reality.  The more that the world's survival is reinforced and the more \"belief\" fueling a person the more solid they are.  \n\nIt's the reason why Magane's abilities are actually phenomenally dangerous. Not only are they abstract and more of a concept that set structured rules? They actively fuck with observation and belief itself through her use of sophistry and lies.  Her entire power set is basically unmaking reality's rules to suit her own ends.  I.e. stealing hangaku, becoming immune to the energy waves from not-persona man.  etc. \n\nThe fact that Altair made the comment about the world rejecting her seems to suggest that the outpouring of affection for Selesia may have also some how bolstered Selesia's goal or the slumbering rules of the world to twist in their favor.  \n\ni.e. Her statement about \"shaking the pillar\" would cause her to be rejected by the world. \n\ntl;dr - The entire basis of the show is about how human will can actually alter reality itself.  The more collected belief the more 'solid' that is.\n\nI'm betting we're going to see an ending that not only has Magane as the main antagonist with Altair being subsumed by her... But perhaps resolving that the world is saved via the collected belief that the world won't be destroyed or can cohabitate instead of being unmade."

There's clearly some limitation or backlash in place that we'll hopefully see more of next episode.\n\nIt was also pretty frustrating watching Sota, despite knowing the truth, refuse to actaully tell Alicetaria that Altair killed Mamika. But it seemed pretty clear shortly after that she probably knows already and simply refuses to believe it, lest she see her knight's honor violated. There's definitely a place for this to be an interesting twist on the Saber-knight archetype that Aliceteria seems to represent.\n\nOn the action front Yuuya is as fun to watch as always and Magane continues to be the anime Joker. I'm really looking forward to how the writers flesh her out into more that just a villain who enjoys fucking things up. And i still have no clue what Altair's powers are supposed to be. Part of me wants to think this may be the point considering she was written by a teenager and flamed pretty hard online. But it's too early to say at this point. Definitely continuing to like where the she is moving, but I really hope they start to get more explicit with what the overall arc is gonna look like.\n\nAlso Matsubara acting like a father/big brother figure to Selesia is adorable."

Mamika told her to listen to Megane right before dying, so what other choice did she have?

Same with this and last episode: if literally any of the characters who know what's up decided to at least, I don't know, **try** to actually explain to Alice what's going on it would at least make them actually believable characters, if nothing else.\n\nTop all of that off with the fact that NO ONE - not Alice, not the MC or Meteora, not even the fucking JAPANESE FBI has bothered to so much as google the powers of any the characters.\n\nSo yeah, Alice aside, pretty much EVERY character is behaving unrealistically retarded and it's very frustrating.
