What an awesome and refreshing first episode.\n\nI like the show's main idea of \"what is the opposite of your generic trapped in another world Light Novel anime?\" Well, what if the light novel characters were trapped in the real world? And, from that idea stems both some awesome action set pieces, but more importantly, well-timed and genuinely funny jokes/gags.\n\nThe first thing that grabbed me about the show was how visually impressive it was. TROYCA is really pulling out all its tricks here, as this episode looks absolutely stunning from start to finish. \n\nHiroyuki Sawano's soundtrack, while similar to everything he's done since Gundam Unicorn, still sets the hype levels high, and it's at least as good as his work on Aldnoah.Zero, so far.\n\nMost importantly, the characters all have heart, distinct personalities, and a sense of humor that makes me want to watch more of them. This was easily the best premiere of a new show so far this season. Very excited to see where this one goes."

This is literally just what was the norm before \"trapped in another world\".\n\nWe have an otaku self insert main character that suddenly meets a girl that is part of some deeper plot that he gets dragged into and probably ends up having some power that he didn't know of that is actually the ultimate power in this newly discovered underworld.\n\nI decided to check this show out based on the summary. It sounded interesting if a little vague. But it seems to me that this show isn't nearly self aware enough to pull off a concept like this.\n\nI dunno, I'll have to give this at least 2 episodes to see how it really is, but so far it's the second most generic opening episode I've seen in a while.\n\nA little hypothesizing, but if all the plot is that \"characters created by authors in our world are real\", does that mean that the authors with the most power are going to end up being shitty fanfiction writers that have total Mary Sue original characters? Or are the characters going to have power levels correlating with how popular their work of fiction is? At what point is a fictional character \"fleshed out\" enough for them to manifest? Could I write about \"Bob the omnipotent\" in two sentences on a cocktail napkin and he becomes real? Or are the only characters that become real the ones that have an anime?\n\nI might have to watch the full run just to have these questions answered."

   "text": "The thing is, every production needs some level of self awareness to even function, even if it's just enough to realize how to pander to an audience.\n\nTo pull of the premise that this anime has, it requires very heavy self awareness, and a deep understanding of fiction as a whole and the writing process. At least, to do it in a way that's interesting beyond just, \"lol what if anime were real?\" Which is damn waste of an interesting premise.\n\nI'm not of the school of thought that an interesting premise can't be redone. But if you want it to be worth making, it will either a) have to add some twist to the idea that goes beyond just what characters occupy each role (ie \"what if it were Madoka instead of Nanoha in the premise?\" isn't enough change to warrant a whole new production.), b) do it better than previous incarnations, or c) remaking it, either just for modern audiences or for a new medium. (Yes, I do believe remakes have their place).\n\nFrom everything I've heard about Kimi no Nawa so far, it's spectacularly well done. Don't compare a highly renowned production with a show that so far hasn't even shown it self to be beyond generic otaku bait.\n\nFrom everything I saw in the first episode, it was a generic \"self insert protagonist meets 'kawaii anime grrl' and has wacky adventures\". For me the most integral part is the story, of course I'm willing to settle for a slightly less original story if the animation, characters, soundtrack etc is fun enough to make up for it, but there still needs to be an interesting story going on. And while there were some decent animation sequences in the first episode, there was also *a lot* of standing around, blathering exposition in such vague terms that it ends up explaining almost nothing about the world other than \"THERE IS A CONFLICT, THE VILLAIN WILL REVEAL HIMSELF\".\n\nI'm mostly losing interest in the anime because the premise sounded like it was going to be a scifi kind of story exploring the nature of stories and storytelling, with the idea that a story can be alive, and in that case what the moral implications are when writing a story.\n\nOf course, it's still too early to say whether any of this is entirely true or not, but the fact of the matter is, the first episode hit just about every cliche marker when it comes to meetcute anime stories. I'm still gonna keep watching it for an episode or two more, as I said, even if my original thoughts on the premise weren't accurate, there are some other questions that I wouldn't mind getting answers to."

It's a bright spot for me since a lot of the non-sequel spring titles has been disappointments so far. Everyone seems to be ignoring Re:CREATORS, but I hope this gets more attention since it will not be on a Saturday competing with AoT and BnH!\n\nIf any of you are unaware of the impressive staff so far, here you go:\n\n- Original Story and Character Concepts: Rei Hiroe (BLACK LAGOON)\n- Director: Ei Aoki (Fate/Zero, Ga-Rei-Zero, Kara no Kyoukai Movie 1)\n- Music: Hiroyuki Sawano (Attack on Titan, Kill la Kill)\n- Animation Production: TROYCA (Aldnoah.Zero, Sakurako)\n\n[Here is a picture that Hiroe drew of both Revy and Celestia](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C7vOvpNVMAA_lQi.jpg). This is confirmed to be 22 episodes, so this should not be rushed.\n\nThe premise seems like something from Fate with heroes from another world/time (this time, from anime) are summoned to the modern world in a sort-of battle royale. And since I'm a big Fate fanboy, I'm already on board with it.\n\nSince this is an Aniplex title, there is a lot of clones from other Aniplex properties. The magical girl looks like Madoka. And the main villain looks like [Nobu](https://i.redditmedia.com/f8Re6PXX1SWeqV5qgcLhZ1Znlnf6JSBEhHy1woMg1HU.jpg?w=768&s=48d01786caed74835e854ca0b7034b1c) from Fate/Grand Order except with swords instead of rifles.\n\nNow there are a couple of people who thinks this will be generic, but I have a LOT of faith in Hiroe. Whether or not you like BLACK LAGOON, you can't deny that it was entertaining with good character development. This will not be like Aldnoah because Hiroe will not drop after 3 episodes like Urobuchi did. "

It seems like the each character has a really complex backstory to explore, and they tried to tease all of them in one episode. I'm hoping the 22 episode airtime will help with that.\n\nAlso, I'm a bit on the fence with fanservice this early on. It's worrying that they introduced three good-looking girls in the first episode, and that two of them will be living with the MC (lucky bastard). Hmm.\n\nThat being said, it does have some scenes of awesome animation, and the art and character designs are super detailed. The MC being an artist himself also is intriguing. \n\nI'm gonna stick to this one! Hopefully it gets even better."

Guess that's deliberate. Anyway, if Celestia came out of the anime and the narrator has the LNs, then I can't see how she could resist spoilers... although we'll doubtlessly soon encounter the question of whether or not it matters if she knows those things, or if the story as written by the creator is set in stone.\n\nI'm disappointed the real-world effects of anime characters appearing and doing battle in the city were downplayed. We saw attacks hit real world buildings, but not anyone reacting to danger or getting hurt. If that's indicative of how the reverse-isekai thing is going to be played, then I'll feel like this show is missing out on part of its potential. Then again, the narrator's injuries instantly became scars instead of bleeding when he got cut, so maybe there's something weird going on with how the anime characters interact with the real world. At least it probably won't be a *secret* war or anything if the introductory battle got so much attention."

Turns out just placing all these things on Earth makes the whole thing (sorta) fun! \n\nRe:Creators looks legitimately good so far as far as first episodes go, but what was with that scene with the glasses? That surely isn't how first-person POVs should look with glasses <_< other than that, there's enough sakuga to have hopes for the rest, along with some nice use of CGI, and great OST by Sawano as always. Of course this could go south like any show of its ilk tend towards, but there's some intrigue and smartness in what could have easily been a lazy plot as an excuse for sakuga. There's the part about the bespectacled girl at the start, and I'm just gonna guess that she's the creator of the 'villain'. \n\nI also like how they refer to Earth as the 'world of the gods', gods being authors. I'd also like if they confront the authors about overly sexualising them, that'd be nice for me to see, heh. One thing I wanna know is how they're going to handle Sota. I don't see the use for this high school kid in the story yet except as a self-insert and love interest for the redhead, but I'm hoping to be surprised. \n\nWhite-haired girl is the best because she seems pretty smart, but the redhead is pretty cute too. I wouldn't even mind if they sit around ala Fate/Zero and just talk about ethics. Other characters seem to include a magical girl, a mecha pilot, a vampire (?), a crusader, and two guys whose abilities I can't discern. "

Take a character with a really tragic backstory for example, for us it's simply a way to explain their personality, motives, create drama, etc.  But in the eyes of the character that had to live it it's only natural they would end up despising their creator and seeing them as despicable people who have no regard for the power they hold or the lives they ruin."

I do like the story so far, but the characters (particularly Souta and Celestia) could have been somewhat more interesting. \n\nI dislike Souta's \"insert-self\" background and personality. Concerning Souta, I do like how 1) he's accepting what he sees instead of annoying everyone by denying his experience and 2) he has a clear cut dream of wanting to be an author, artist or general creator of his own story. These two points are all what I think set him apart from the traditional harem MC I've grown to hate.\n\nI also find Celestia to be somewhat boring and overdone, personality-wise. Personally I'm just tired of \"perfect female love interests\" and her position as the hero of her story does very little to make her appealing to me. \n\nHell, the antagonist interests me the most out of everyone on this show. It's only the first episode but I'll stick with it for a while longer, here's to hoping some character development saves the day."

It reminds me of Akira Kurosawa films that employ movement (watch Every frame a painting for an explanation). Even in shots that dont have movement in the foreground, things are busy in the background. It keeps the viewer interested and attentive. Another one is that you see employment of techniques such as the blurring of background and focus in the foreground. Its a normal thing in film and photograph but not seen much in anime except for high quality productions. The selective focusing of the foreground helps focus on whats important. Little things like these really sell it for me."

A smarmy ass loli that doesn't know when to shut the fuck up.  \n\nOtherwise yes, this is intriguing, and the directing is good for action, but I'm having trouble seeing where the narrative is heading or what it wants to accomplish. For now it's planting speculation seeds and hooks people in via the truly self-insert protagonist of an anime fan...  \nIt seems like its appeal is concept driven and really, *really* likes the directing of its action scenes, to the point where it becomes blas\u00e9.   \n\nI don't trust its storytelling presentation, but at least as a dumb action show, it can work."
