I liked that they didn't go too long with that. But that kiss interruption:  \n[](#moeshitarcher)  \n  \nThe dead city felt really creepy and I like it a lot. I liked the environmental visuals and the mystery and scary feeling of the place - no people, no mechanisms working, strange underground complex with a weapon of mass destruction and that little \"killer\" loli.  \n  \nI still don't get why people reacted so harsh on this series. Actually, this is one of the most interesting series this season plot-wise and has one of the best waifus (RyuZU) I have seen in anime. (though I won't lie, that I have a fetish on savage, good-looking and a bit yandere-type girls). The world building is pretty interesting and while I can agree that the 1st episode wasn't great, the series as whole is going pretty well and I would definetely recommend to give it another try to any person who dropped it at the 1st episode."

The visuals, in particular, were a big expectation from the LN style (though the PVs were giving a better idea of the show's style). And the show is still getting better each episode by adding more world building, ironing out but also evolving the characters - which means that those things weren't all thrown at our faces in the first minutes."

Some of the depictions of the world are the other thing, the author sometimes does a great job at hinting at more going on without bludgeoning you with infodumps. The scene with Marie getting pissed off at the mecha was a big one of these; you can start to understand how much the cities and their clocktowers mean to her, and that using it to make that feels against everything she's stood for.\n\nI just wish the actual plot felt more inspired.
