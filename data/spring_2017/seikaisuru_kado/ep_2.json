While every time I see Kado mentioned I always see praise and people saying that it's their sleeper hit of this season. \n\nAnd just to back up what u/reset_switch said, people aren't complaining because the show is bad, it's just that it didn't quite meet their expectations.

Those ideas reek of nothing but \"human arrogance\".\n\n> Consider a higher life form - a human being, and a lower one, say, a Chimpanzee at a zoo. Let's say you go see one and you are incredibly fascinated by it. So you spend some time with it, to observe what it does, what does it eat, what kind of environment it needs to survive, it's biology and everything else in it's daily routine. You start trying to \"fix\" things for him, by providing him with food, water and other necessities.    \nSo, you've spent a considerable amount of time and effort into investigating and observing this life form, all to satisfy your own curiosity, but let me ask you this, after doing all that, would you start acting like a Chimp? Because you know, after being with one for so long, you might have gained \"Chimp emotions\". The difference between you and the Chimp isn't even that great, just a few percentages in DNA.\n\nThe anisotropic beings are our creators. The difference here is many times greater than the difference between a human and a chimp. And you're treating them as these monkeys who will start imitating whatever they see.\n\n[](#nyanpasu)\n\nEven if I accept the premise of zaShunina \"gaining human emotions\". The idea of him not being able to comprehend them properly or process them, baffles me. Just because *you*, as a human being, can't properly understand *your* emotions, doesn't mean an anisotropic being won't be able to. They *created* you, along with the whole universe you exist in. They are capable of processing the whole 3-D universe in an instant. You, on the other hand, are easily fooled by a pattern of lines and colors on a piece of paper (called optical illusions... and sometimes waifus).\n\nHuman emotions aren't such glorious and complex things that a being, who is on is on the same level as a \"God\", can't understand. To assume that otherwise, only shows how arrogant you are.\n\nI'm infuriated that such an entity is being treated as a \"mere\" human, just for the sake of giving us this generations old battle of \"right\" vs \"wrong\". What is presented is only justified from a human's arrogant point of view, but not from the anisotropic's."

   "text": "The things that you've mentioned refer to the perception of the observer, which is entirely dependent on *who* the observer is. Take a simple ink blot or a cloud in the sky. While different people will see different shapes and figures in those patterns, it doesn't mean that the ink blot or the cloud *becomes* it. It is still just a cloud floating in the sky, or an ink blot. That added meaning comes from the observer.\n\nNow, let's take a deeper look into why that happens. Why do blots of ink or a random group of clouds or things around us in general, sometimes seem to represent or appear to be something more than they are? Well, that is because our brains are used to picking out patterns. And our brains don't like the absence of information in that vague mess. They have a very particular fetish of organising things, in whatever way they can. So you have people who see animals, shapes and faces in clouds and in blots of ink. And that perception is only the reflection of who they are, not what the thing really is.\n\nThe element of surprise arises from lack of information about something. Like you were thinking about a certain thing someone was going to do but they end up doing something else altogether. That is because you had an image of that person, in your mind, a piece of information, that was built on *your* perception of that individual. And that perception is always lacking in information. Because there are things about that person that are unknown to you or that the information in question is in overwhelming quantity. And when that person acts upon that \"unknown\" information, you end up surprised.\n\nIn case of our own creations, this problems occurs between the conscious \"ego\", the sub-conscious and the unconscious. For example, take yourself. Who are you? Certainly an image pops into your mind, about who you are, what you do, what you look like, your name, etc. But if you investigate further, does that image include all the necessary information about your nervous system? Or how your blood circulates? Or how you digestive system works?    \nProbably not. But all those things influence you in more than ways than one. And so you end up surprising yourself. Because your perception of yourself is missing some vital information that you didn't account for, or information that you can't possibly account for because it is simply too much in quantity for you to process, so you brain ends up picking out what it thinks is important. And it reflects itself in your creations (you impart certain information to them unconsciously or sub-consciously).\n\nNow, lets get to emotions.    \nEmotions are vague. If you try to describe happiness or sadness, you might describe some physical symptoms - like warmth or a cold sensation, dullness, fatigue or a fuzzy feeling in your stomach. You might give an example of an event, and say, \"you know it is like standing on the balcony on a refreshing morning\", but it is never quite \"on the mark\". It is not that emotions are incomprehensible. It is just quite difficult to put them into words, into patterns and relations from past experiences, so you can have an organised piece of information. Even though you have already grasped it, intuitively.\n\nSo, to make things clear, I'll make a correction in your statement.\n\n> I don't think it's truly possible, *for us humans*, to understand every aspect of what we make.\n\nBecause human beings are vastly imperfect beings. We can't truly comprehend ourselves in the first place. Or vague, messy, chaotic things like emotions or quantum mechanics (bad science joke, I'm sorry). The amount of information we can process in an instant is fairly limited.    \nBut the anisotropic being a different monster. It's not that it *can't* process information or that it missed something, but that it doesn't *have* information to process. It has already done all of it. And now it wants more.\n\nAnd it is not that the information in question is complex beyond the anisotropic being's capability. Or that it is in overwhelming quantity.\n\nSo, if Shindo's big plan for \"surprising\" zaShunina is to point him towards these \"emotions\" he has gained, and he somehow agrees to that, then I'm going to be very disappointed."

   "text": "> That's how the writers want it.\n\nSo, that's what the argument boils down to in the end. Screw all the previous episodes and the build up, all the flashy shit about the anisotropic people being capable of processing any amount of information in an instant, that they already processed everything in all 37 dimensions, so, in order to have more information to process they created these information cocoons, small pocket universes in lower dimensions, in one of which, resides our planet Earth. And here we are, the great mighty humans with our emotions.\n\nBut wait, if the anisotropic beings were observing us all along (as evident from the first few minutes of the previous episode), then wouldn't they already know when human beings stopped using their instinctual perception of things and developed a consciousness that is separate from it, which, slowly, over time, evolved to be capable to these things called emotions?    \nBut NOOOOO- glorious humans and their emotions. Oh I cannot comprehend, for they are simply too much for my puny anisotropic self. Logic and reason, what are those?\n\n> Everybody has their own idea of how an omnipotent being would think.\n\nI think what you're trying to say is how an *omniscient* being would think.\n\nI've simply based my argument on what's stated in the show. I haven't added my own conjectures to that. I am not saying *how* an omniscient being would think, but that an omniscient being would be capable of understanding anything *because* he is omniscient.    \nAnd the anisotropic beings, are, in a way, omniscient, because they have already processed all information in existence. And it is not that there is information that they *can't* process, there just isn't enough information for them to *keep processing*. That was the original argument raised by the show. To quote zaShunina :\n\n> The vast processing power of the anisotropic can process any information in an instant. Therefore, it is plagued by a constant lack of information. We want information. We want to absorb a huge amount of information. We want to bathe in more information that we could ever process.\n\nSo, no, he didn't \"came in and wanted to intervene with humans so that he could take them back with him so he wouldn't be alone.\" His reason for taking them into the anisotropic is never directly stated. But it is implied that since this information cocoon houses an anisotropic singularity, he would want to take it to the anisotropic to process it.\n\nThe kind of relationship the anisotropic beings have with humanity is on the same level as one between a farmer and his crop. It is like picking ripe fruit from a tree. And if the fruit you decided to pick isn't ripe, you come back later.    \nYou don't start acting like that fruit or go \"Oh, it is too soon, better wipe this fruit out of existence, because my pride as a fruit farmer is hurt. How dare this fruit! To not be ripe when I came to pick it. I'll destroy this fruit and clone it because -\"    \nI'm sorry, I really can't carry that train of thought any more. It is too ridiculous.\n\n***\n\nAlso, the anisotropic beings creating \"humanity\" isn't a misconception. They created this universe, and so everything that resides here was in turn created by them. Human beings aren't something that *came out* of this universe, we are a part of it. We're made by the same matter that all the stars and the galaxies are made up of. To put it in simple terms, the anisotropic beings planted the seed of the universe, like an acorn, and it turned into this giant oak tree. But the oak was always implied in the acorn."

But to play a game and pretend that you're not playing games, that is it something serious, will only bring misery to you and to the people around you.

Remember what zaShunina said to Saraka when she first appeared in her anisotropic form to save Shindo,\n\n> So you're the administrator of this cocoon.\n\n***\n\nAs for your question about \"The Right Answer\"...    \nThe right answer to what?

His ~~cute~~ [brooding] (http://imgur.com/a/5pIVC) is pretty obvious, fondling the bookmark between his finger and thumb, rocking slightly in the chair, saying *only* a few words to 'Shindo' despite it being *his* plan to advance the world and failing to meet 'Shindo's' eyes when he's asked. He's seriously reflecting, or *trying* to understand these unknown feelings that are most likely growing and storming inside of him. That also comes back to why he continuously reads books. To match and put a name on the feelings that are evoked from reading, to the ones he's feelings.\n\nI have problems with Tsukai. Her abundant appearances in the OP, her title as negotiator to pair with Shindo, even her role marked as 'main' tells us she's important... but all throughout the series, her interaction with Shindo hasn't been intimate up until the last couple of episodes. By intimate, I mean the kind of interaction zaShunina and Shindo have been having in their negotiations of advancing the world, but also seemingly the exploration, expansion and assimilation of zaShunina's character and personality as he learns to communicate more human-like, as well as him exploring humanity itself. Yes, within the time frame of the scene itself, the kiss had a nice build-up, but Tsukai's presence had almost nothing to do with Shindo OR negotiation and it's hard to grasp her importance now. Hell! Hanamori has a better chance with Shindo than Tsukai has.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether I'm a hardcore BL fan, the story up until now has emphasised *strongly* on building Shindo and zaShunina's relationship based on negotiation. What's more, Shindo better understands what zaShunina fails to understand about himself. At this point, even if there *is* no romantic love in it, even if zaShunina doesn't know what to identify his attachment to Shindo as, they're a better pair. They've built a platonic bond. But alas... \n\nMaybe the fanbase can recreate the ending better. I don't know. The amount of philosophical heavy topics up until now were great material to work with. The ending we're getting can't be the only route. There *has* to be more than shouting into the anisotropic while fighting your best alien bud with barely-advanced human-technology (not doubting Shinawa's genius, but christ). The [preview] (http://imgur.com/a/1Z4Ux) seems pretty intense. zaShunina does seem to have a lot of pent up frustration in him. I mean, he's perfectly grasped the concept of yandere and taken it up to [a whole new level] (http://imgur.com/MfF8WeT). We really have to appreciate the [expression] (http://imgur.com/e5ADgvk) of [relief] (http://imgur.com/45Io535) zaShunina makes when he sees the real Shindo. Because there *is* no amount of copies that could replace him.\n\nDisappointment aside, look at really upset [Hanamori] (http://imgur.com/mN4jrjD)."

Her abundant appearances in the OP, her title as negotiator to pair with Shindo, even her role marked as 'main' tells us she's important... but all throughout the series, her interaction with Shindo hasn't been intimate up until the last couple of episodes. By intimate, I mean the kind of interaction zaShunina and Shindo have been having in their negotiations of advancing the world, but also seemingly the exploration, expansion and assimilation of zaShunina's character and personality as he learns to communicate more human-like, as well as him exploring humanity itself. Yes, within the time frame of the scene itself, the kiss had a nice build-up, but Tsukai's presence had almost nothing to do with Shindo OR negotiation and it's hard to grasp her importance now. Hell! Hanamori has a better chance with Shindo than Tsukai has.\n\nYou said it better and more eloquently than I could. I was sooooo disappointed with this show to be honest. It just went downhill on episode 8."

   "text": "Where the hell is this show going? When those construction workers said 'save the world' to Shindo I felt all the impartial uncertainty of ZaShunia's role swept away, and ZaShunia's weird Yandere shit didn't help that either, made him seem like he wasn't all there. I don't like how the show seems to be hand-waving his idea as nothing more than evil (by our standards of morality at least). He's seeming less alien by the episode and more like a typical villain, his grand postures and long speeches certainly not helping. \n\nThough perhaps his nature is conflicting with his growing humanity, causing some defects to his mental health, which would make sense, and they haven't entirely dropped the sympathetic aspects of his character either, but I'm really not sure what how're they're going to resolve such a philosophically dense show like this, with what they've written themselves into, at least I'm not sure how they could do it in a way that is both cathartic and true to the themes, especially with my worries about ZaShunia. \n\nI'm glad that Shindo is going to negotiate with ZaShunia and not just fight him, but the preview gave me little hope that it was going to turn out like that. Looks like a massive fight's going to happen, but maybe it'll surprise me, it always has, for better or for worse. Maybe the discussion takes place after they've trapped him or something. \n\nThe whole relationship between Tsukai and Shindo felt a bit underwhelming as well, I feel as though the bizarre circumstances drew them together more than anything else, but above all I don't feel like the show needs to put a romance in here anyway, the concept of an anisotropic and a human having a relationship is novel at best, given how vague the concept has been kept up until this point, though it's a testament to how Tsukai has chosen her humanity over her true nature so there's that, but I feel as though she's demonstrated that plenty up until this point. \n\nThe scientist seemed somewhat apprehensive or conflicted about Shindo stopping ZaShunia, but I'm not sure how they're going to get her involved at all if they plan to develop that, though if anyone was going to oppose it it would be her, seeing how fascinated she is by the whole thing, so I thought it was a nice touch, if that's all it remains. \n\nThough the sequence of KADO expanding and engulfing Tokyo was about as harrowing as the first shot of KADO was mesmerising, pulling back on Tokyo as it was taken was a nice callback to the first episode. The feeling of uncertainty replaced by dread, though I'm not happy with the direction taken, the way they're portraying it is still brilliant. \n\nAbove all though there's a lot that's left hanging, Hanamori's relation with Tsukai is apparently a strong one? Did I miss something, was there anything between them, platonic or otherwise? Hanamori's been a weird one anyway, Shindo says he's always been there but I can't say I remember him doing much throughout the show, maybe he'll come into his own, but I feel like some more time with him would've been nice. The whole thing with the UN was dropped, and the stuff with Setten brushed away, I supposes since the consequences are now beyond our universe, issues like World Politics and TNCs would seem trivial now, but I must admit I do miss that sense of political uncertainty that permeated the earlier episodes, though it had to end at some point I suppose. \n\nOverall, I think I'll remain cautiously optimistic, but not without a large amount of uncertainty over how this is going to end."

There was a ton of foreshadowing, like the whole 'he's meant for someone greater'.\n\nAaaaaand really, the moment Saraka became a god, I was basically lost. It goes from being something that feels like a philosophical scifi to something that feels like a shonen series. He has a shield, so we have to break that shield, by using the allies we made along the way!\n\nOh, and the new weapon has to have a cool stylized super-hero esque-design.\n\nThe *entire show* was about negotiations. Two of the three main characters are literally negotiators. So why is he going to go brute force his way to victory? It feels so bizarre that he'd even *consider* brute force rather than alternate negotiation tactics. I'm really, really hoping that the final show down is going to be a negotiation, but... I don't have much faith, honestly.\n\nI'm sure some people will disagree, but to me, it feels like the entire show has become a mess of tropes and betrayed it's original premise."

There is no other word for it.\n\nIt tricks you into thinking it's main focus is \"negotiations\" and, WOW! there is an alien. Alien + negotiations. I'd totally watch a serious show about that.\n\nBut let's look back. How many times has there been any actual negotiation in this fucking joke? Once? Maybe? In the first episode? If you can call that a negotiation?\n\nIt wasn't by lack of opportunity. When Wam was introduced, there was conflict between U.N. and Japan. Both Shindo and ZaRaka are negotiators from Japan that have done deals within the U.N. Which one of them negotiated? NONE. They just ignored U.N. demands, didn't even talk to them, and forcefully broadcast how to make the Wams for everyone to see. Where the fuck exactly is this a negotiation?\n\nThere hasn't been any sort of negotiation between ZaChina and Japan either. ZaChina makes demands, the prime minister says \"okay.\" Every time Shindo and ZaRaka \"negotiated\" in behalf of each party it was just Shindo explaining how stuff works. There have been no concessions. No change of plans. No whatever.\n\nSo far the most negotiating that has been actually done was at the first (or second?) episode when ZaChina wanted a way to communicate with Japan in 3 seconds and Shindo said \"no, bro, more time pls\" and he conceded. That was about it. That was the sum of all negotiations held with aliens so far in this entire series.\n\nThe anime is only romanticizing the art of negotiation without actually doing any of it. It's some sort of crappy exposure."

   "text": "> Where did you pick up zaShunina being a villain? Everything he's done has aligned well if you think about it.\n\nIf you are referring to the popular hypothesis of zaShunina gaining \"human emotions\" then let me tell you why that hypothesis is stupid.\n\nConsider a higher life form - a human being, and a lower one, say, a Chimpanzee at a zoo. Let's say you go see one and you are incredibly fascinated by it. So you spend some time with it, to observe what it does, what does it eat, what kind of environment it needs to survive, it's biology and everything else in it's daily routine. You start trying to \"fix\" things for him, by providing him with food, water and other necessities.    \nSo, you've spent a considerable amount of time and effort into investigating and observing this life form, but let me ask you this, after doing all that, would you start acting like a Chimp? Because you know, after being with one for so long, you might have gained \"Chimp emotions\". The difference between you and the Chimp isn't even that great, just a few percentages in DNA.\n\nSee, when I read about people bringing up the point of zaShunina gaining \"human emotions\" because of spending time and interacting with us, it astonishes me. The arrogance that is. That here we are, as human beings, the greatest thing to ever come out of the cosmos, in all its 37 dimensions. Revel in our glory, for our emotions of love, hate, pride, jealousy, happiness and sadness are something that even the Gods want for themselves. And no one, besides our glorious selves, can possibly hope to even begin to understand them. Oh the great homo sapiens.    \nGet a hold of yourself!\n\nThe anisotropic beings *created* humans along with the universe they live in. They are beings that *can*, and quite possibly, already *have* processed all the information in the anisotropic. On the other hand, we, human beings, barely have any conclusive answers about our own *little* 3-dimensional universe. We've built machines for computing because our conscious attention can barely keep track of 5-6 variables at once. Our eyes can only see a tiny part of the total spectrum of light. Our brains are easily deceived by a few scribbles drawn on a paper known as optical illusions. The list goes on. But nooooooo, we have emotions, and no one can understand them. NO! **You** can't understand them, doesn't mean that a being capable of processing your whole universe in an instant, can't.\n\nAssuming something like that just goes to show how arrogant you're being.\n\nSo, no, I do not accept that hypothesis that zaShunina has somehow gained \"human emotions\" and that he is like a baby who doesn't understand what is going on in his \"heart\". Imposing these things on him and them making him act like he is in the \"wrong\", is what baffles me.\n\nAnd that makes him a \"villain\" (the role is forced on him), because, just as you said, everything he's done has aligned well with the \"human\" point of view, but not the anisotropic.\n\n***\n\n> Don't you think they'd be somehow used to it by now?\n\nIt's not a matter of getting used to. For an individual human to cause destruction with a Wam, he has to have access to equipment that can draw out and utilize it's power. Because wam is like a battery which can supply any amount of requested power indefinitely. And *salsa* just gives a person an *understanding* of the anisotropic. So, maybe one can make more wams. The applications of those two only become disastrous when one has access to a certain amount of equipment on hand, equipment that a normal citizen can't easily get their hands on (for example, the suit Shindo is wearing).\n\nBut Nanomis-heim doesn't require *any* equipment. It is literally the ability to manipulate the basic laws (or things) of the universe - like mass, gravity, position, size, etc. It is like giving everyone the access to dev console. I've already stated a simple case in my original comment so I don't think I need to give more examples."

The likeliness of something being carried over to the next species increases with their genetic or biological similarities. The point was that you don't gain Chimp emotions *even when you are so closely related to Chimps*. And people are saying that an alien being who exists in a different dimension altogether and has lived a lot longer than the current age of our universe, will somehow acquire human emotions over such a short period of interaction. On top of which, they'll act as if they don't know what those emotions are that they are experiencing.\n\n> And judging from what little we've seen of these beings, they don't really needed to form any emotions in there lives.

So for them to develop these emotions is not really far off.\n\nFirstly, I'll ask you to not make assumptions on what the anisotropic beings are aside from what is mentioned in the show. Things like their quality of life are never mentioned, so making assumptions there for the sake of an argument is pointless.\n\nAll that is mentioned is that they wanted information to process. In such a vast amount that they can't process it all in an instant. How does that simple fact lead you to believe that such a being would possess emotions?\n\nAt one hand you are stating how zaShunina is alien, how he differs biologically and how he shares no connections with human beings, but on the other hand you're stating that \"it is not really far off\" that he will end up developing emotions, as if he operates just like a human being. Just what the heck are *you* smoking?\n\nAlso that rant about emotions was just to sarcastically illustrate this point. You seem to have missed it altogether.    \nWhy the special treatment to emotions? As if they are something the can transcend dimensions and effect an alien being in such a short interval of time. I simply cannot see why a being who is so vastly different from a human on so many dimensions, would contract something like that? It is possible for life on Earth to share such aspects because evolution shows us that if we retrace our steps, we will end up finding a common ancestor. Just look at the DNA of different species. So many similarities.\n\n> I really don't get it here.

To him, he's helping humanity and giving them a higher plane of existence, so he thinks that's the right answer.\n\nTo quote a part of my reply to another comment here (with a few additions) :\n\nThe kind of relationship the anisotropic beings have with humanity is on the same level as one between a farmer and his crop. It is like picking ripe fruit from a tree. zaShunina isn't trying to \"help\" humanity. It is as he said, that this \"information cocoon\" has yielded fruit that can be of use to him. Something that will quench his thirst for information.\n\nNow, if the fruit you decided to pick isn't ripe, you come back later.\nYou don't start acting like that fruit or go \"Oh, it is too soon, better wipe this fruit out of existence, because my pride as a fruit farmer is hurt. How dare this fruit! To not be ripe when I came to pick it. I'll destroy this fruit and clone it because -\"\nI'm sorry, I really can't carry that train of thought any more. It is too ridiculous.\n\nTo put it simply, what's the rush? If the humanity isn't ready yet, just come back later. Why go about it in such a \"human\" way? Forcefully trying to whisk them away to the anisotropic. Humanity (or Shindo to be more precise) clearly failed his test. He himself states, \"It was too soon, then.\" Even Saraka states that humanity might not survive the transition.\n\nLike I said, zaShunina is being \"forced\" to play the villain (by the writers in this case) when he shouldn't be doing something like that based on the nature of his previous actions.\n\nAnd when I said \"everything he's done has aligned well with the human point of view\", that is what I mean. That from a human's point of view, something which considers zaShunina as a \"human\" and imposes human values and concepts of greed, anger, pride, good and bad on him, he has done everything right. But from the anisotropic's point of view, where all he needs is more information than he can process in an instant, an endeavor where his kind has invested billions of years in, he is acting in an \"un-natural\" way by being forceful, trying to kill, and taking actions that will destroy the effort invested and can't possibly lead to a desirable outcome."

To list:\n\n* retarded \"I'm so nerdy\" science girl. Bad. Could stop the bullshit there, did not.\n* ZaChina being a child series level of comic villain. Disappointingly bad. Could stop there, did not.\n* ZaRaka being a demi-god. Pretty bad twist. Could stop there, did not.\n* ZaRaka kissing Shindo-kun. Wtf levels of bad. Could stop there, did not.\n* ZaChina turning 120% gay. Are you fucking kidding me levels of bad. Could stop there, did not.\n* Literal plot armor crafting. Looks like a goddamn iron man suit. I wouldn't believe it would turn this bad if someone told me about it when I had finished watching the first episode levels of bad.\n\nWhy is this anime so disappointing?!?!?! How can it be so bad?! This is an horror.\n\nI used to compare Kado to Trainwreck-anime but now I realize Trainwreck-anime is actually BETTER than Kado. This is because the only fuckup Trainwreck-anime did was introducing Biba (there was some attack-on-titan and firing-mah-laser shenanigans, but it was nothing that wouldn't happen in Resident Evil, for example). Everything else in trainwreck-anime was pretty good. You could even say if only Biba didn't exist trainwreck-anime would be a masterpiece. But this isn't the case with Kado. KADO JUST KEEPS BIBA'ING EVERY FUCKING EPISODE.\n\nSeriously who the hell wrote this crap. It's like they took a good script fed it to a horse and used what came out of its ass for the anime. The concept is good. The first 6 episodes put it in a good direction. But then, just after the start, it starts hitting so many lampposts. It's like if you were driving a racing car which had a pretty good acceleration but when it comes the time to make that nice curve you spin and spin and spin and just keep spinning like a beyblade or a drunkard.\n\nThe lack of skill in handling the mid-point of the story is disgusting. It just keeps adding crap to counter-act crap it added before. It's like trying to fix a lie with another lie. Patching a bug with another bug. I mean, seriously, let's look back.\n\nWe wouldn't need iron-man armor if we didn't to physically fight a goddamn anisotropic being.\n\nWe wouldn't need to fight him if he didn't go bananas.\n\nHad he not gone bananas, we wouldn't need a demi-anistropic being to stop him (temporarily) and save Shindo.\n\nIn that case, forced-best-girl wouldn't kiss Shindo out of nowhere.\n\nAlso, retarded-scientist-girl reason to exist seem to be helping Shindo building his iron man suit. So, hopefully, had ZaChina not went bananas, that totally off-place depiction of science would disappear. No hollywood science!\n\nChrist I'm so disappointed. And did you see retarded-science-girl talking about going to the anisotropic? You know it. I know it. We know it. It gets worse from now..."

Either way, I agree completely and I don't even see how this show can redeem itself anymore. All the interest and new plot development has been replaced with the action of a mediocre shounen and the drama of some shitty high school romance show with a yandere and tsundere as God's of the universe.\n\nThey keep piling on garbage and then realizing it doesn't make sense so they pull more shit out to see if they can cover it up. And it just keeps making it worse. Thank God this show is only 12 episodes or I would've dropped it by now."

   "text": "> Literal plot armor crafting. Looks like a goddamn iron man suit. \n\n[](#laughter)\n\nHaven't laughed this hard in a while. Your weekly rants are now my favourite part of these discussion threads. I don't _hate_ the show yet - I went from really liking it to _mildly_ liking it while feeling a little miffed - but your opinion couldn't be more spot on. Shame about the downvotes. \n\n>And did you see retarded-science-girl talking about going to the anisotropic?\n\nWouldn't it be fitting punishment for zaShunina if he gets to take only genki-science-girl back with him to the anisotropic? The chattering would a) fulfill his initial hunger for information and b) eventually make him want to kill himself."

   "text": "This episode was absolutely ridiculous. There was so much ridiculous stuff happening this episode that I don't even know where to start. ZaShuina suddenly has developed a homosexual yandere obsession over Shindo, and Shindo became Iron Man and is now wearing a super suit. This episode ruined any hope I had left for a good finale. Boy has this show gone to the shitter over the last few episodes. \n\nAt least the kiss was nice."

   "text": "Really loving and enjoying the whole series so far. Tomorrow I'll probably go for the finale, if not, then very soon. I feel like threads are being brought together very well, and Tsukai in particular went from [alright, not standout, pretty cute] to [whoa, cool] with the Recent Reveals.\n\nThe absolute lack of faith and sense of betrayal by some people baffles me, but hey, everyone's got their own perspectives. I don't feel like the series led me on, betrayed me, or became 'stupid'. It could have gone in other directions, sure, but I'm happy with the way things are playing out. Tropes are neither bad, nor good, they're like the Wam. It's all in how they're used. \n\nThere's reasons that the 'aliens' in our fiction always have some part, fragment, connection, or correlation to ourselves, unless said aliens are /meant/ to be frightening or horrifying. Just think about what some of those reasons are, if you're not sure why the show would ever take the recent twists and turns it has.\n\nEDIT: Also, this reaction is like an inverse of Star Trek The (slow) Motion Picture. In that, TMP was boring as all hell, but defended as Cerebral and seen as more Intelligent, inherently, because it didn't have that icky action and excitement. Now, by adding said elements, Kado is under siege as being Base, Cliche, Stupid. Disagree."
