( \u0361\u00b0 \u035c\u0296 \u0361\u00b0)\n\n* [And that kids is how OreImo was written..](http://imgur.com/a/OaYyl)\n\n\n* [Elf kinda reminds me of Eriri here.](http://imgur.com/a/9uUK8) Except she's writing instead of drawing.\n\n* [Of course Izumi misunderstands this line..](http://imgur.com/a/YhMHu) \n\n>Because it's a hobby, I put all my might into it!\n\nI guess I understand Elf's thinking in this. My main hobby is building pla models and there's this kit that I've been working on for almost 3 months now. As far as I can remember I've never put this much thought and effort into something before, not studying or even work. I put all my might into it because it's something that I really love and enjoy. \n\nAlthough it's kinda funny on how she lost though. While she did write a masterpiece it was something written for fans, which probably means it was a novel filled tropes and cliches that would appeal to her audience. While Izumi wrote something personal and would only appeal to Sagiri since it was basically a \"300 page Love Letter\" to her. It'll be interesting to see on how they'll make it into an anime. \n\nAlso I never realized how emotional drawing big boobs can be. Props to Sagiri for working 2 weeks endlessly to get the perfect oppai.\n\n[](#salute)\n"
