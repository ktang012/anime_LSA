Of course it sounds extreme but we have yet to find out the aftermath. Perhaps the online art community falsely comes to the conclusion that she is a phony and results in her getting no work and then she starts resenting drawing, which is essentially resenting herself. And who knows, maybe she already had suicide tendencies and it was art that saved her. But now she's realized there's no place, no career in art for her.

Maybe from overexerting her powers?\n\nI'm guessing Altair has some kind of trait that allows her to copy-\n\noh shit.\n\nSince all the hate from the internet accused Setsuna of being a redrawer/copycat or whatever, it wouldn't be too much of a long shot to say that she can replicate other works of fiction yeah? On top of that, maybe being able to absorb other works of fiction to act as fuel for more copies. And *maybe* if she doesn't have enough absorbed, Altair's power starts draining creative fuel from her own existence? So she absorbed Selesia's mech and that energy(I guess) was turned into a copy Gigas Machina we saw last episode. But when she tried to use more, she started getting all pixely and stuff.\n\nHey I think I'm onto something here. Also going back to\n\n>maybe being able to absorb other works of fiction to act as fuel for more copies\n\nI think this could be interpreted to like gaining inspiration from original work from creators and producing fan content. Like the whole doujinshi culture they have in Japan you know?\n\n..I kinda ran out of steam here and I dunno where I was going with this, but it feels like Altair could be some kind of symbolization of all the internet hate that was garnered towards Setsuna's drawings."

It's just that, as someone pointed out, her powers are crazy. The ability to create a perfect copy of anything, including a giant robot, is not only really powerful but also very difficult to put in a real story. Setsuna didn't have this kind of limitation, so she included that power - and maybe even more crazy ones.\n\nAltair probably has a limit on her combat power, but I don't think we've seen it already. In the last episode, it felt like her powers were so great that they could immediately cause the collision of the worlds. However, given the current balance of information, if she triggered the collision the world would kick her out.\n\nSo I assume her goal will be to create even more ruckus, possibly forcing the other creations outside of their defined role to make them overreact like Mamika did. By shaking the world and blurring the line between real and fiction, she could cause a mutual destruction when the collision occurs."

His biggest contribution thus far to the overall work is that he contributed toward the creation of the antagonist. And if the speculations are correct and all he did is join in on the internet hate machine than I wouldn't even put too much stock in him doing even that. \n\nSubaru was thrown in the middle of a situation and struggled to grow out of his useless shell. To be honest he barely ever does gain value within the society but he at the very least gains value for the viewers because we get to see all of the twisted things he does just to survive. He took a gigantic burden onto himself and we watched as the weight of it crushed him time and time again until he could finally see even a glimmer of light.\n\nSota on the other hand can literally just be replaced. His absence wouldn't be missed. I feel that the show would be much better if the *actual* creators were the main focus. The entire story would still function, even the entire story of Altair's creation considering Sota wasn't the only factor toward her creation. They could still reflect on that aspect of creation and further develop the other creators by giving them his parts in the story. I get that Sota is supposed to be the self insert character but this story just really doesn't need that. He is a tumor on this show that needs to be cut out for the betterment of the work."

Assuming that a character is capable of making rational, reasonable decisions.\n\nBut We, watchers, are just bystanders, we can think about it calmly and make good decisions. But characters can't.\n\nThe problem is that Sota is NOT rational, he may seem capable of thinking things through but then his depression and other emotions kick in. It reminds me the time I was hiding bad grades from my parents. I knew they would learn eventually, I knew I'd get flack for that. But I still did it despite knowing the consequences because long-term consequences were less important than immediate consequences. \n\nYou can never assume that a character who clearly shows signs of depressions and PTSD can make rational decisions. \n\nIn fact I think even Meteora pointed it out. She was trying to be understanding and gentle but that was counter-productive because it gave Sota a way to slip out. But when Mamika confronted him she pushed him into a corner, gently but still did. And she was not someone he had a connection with, like with Celesia or Meteora. So it might have been easier. "

This fear should overwhelm any emotion as soon as he realised that the world would end. Like you said he needed to be pushed into a corner to be able to overcome his depression, but that realistically should have been when the end of the world is coming. It shouldn't take seeing people's blood spilling (at least what the third time?) to realistically push someone into a corner unless that person has some really strong metal fortitude which he clearly doesn't. Guilt, depression, trauma can't possibly trump survival instincts. Not even talking about rationality here. He essentially said nothing with a gun pointed to his head and that's not believable at all especially not in his state of mind. He was under threat and he recognised this and that didn't push him into a corner? That doesn't make any sense to me."

Anyone who's been shitting on why Sota's been acting that way hasn't ever really experienced a real tragedy, and if they have and they haven't felt at least *in some way* responsible they're probably antisocial or sociopathic in some way.\n\nThat may also be why I get so worked up about people saying the writing in this show is terrible. It absolutely is not, they've just never experienced these kinds of situations before and instead just relate it to some other anime they've seen. That's not in any way a decent \"why\"; it's just a cop-out for people who can't comprehend real tragedy and the conceptualization of writing characters.

No one with a normal human brain and normal human psychology would feel this much guilt just because he was jealous of someone more talented than he is which leads to him growing further apart from Setsuna. That part is perfectly normal. There is absolutely no way (at least not with what's presented in the show atm, after 11 episodes already) Souta would have known Setuna would somehow die or kill herself, and there is no reason why he feels that he deserves to be blamed for the suicide and why he feels he may even be able to stop someone from committing suicide (which is generally quite hard to mentally stop someone from wanting to kill himself). I mean sure, you would feel a bit guilty and think you could at least give it a try and you may have helped that person. But you wouldn't have as much guilt as presented in this show, where he is just whining over and over for 4 - 5 episodes while hiding very important plot points. That's just retarded.\n\nThe same way is you wouldn't feel THAT guilty just because your used to be close friend from high school suddenly committed suicide, and you didn't reach out just because you grew further apart and you didn't have a chance to try to talk him/her out of it. You might think \"oh, maybe I could have tried to talk him out\", but not \"omg wtf I just killed this person I am a monster!\" level of guilt."

The part where Matsubara decides to write in a bit more entertainment into her world based on her feedback was a nice touch.\n\nKanoya growing beyond just \"that dude with the mech\" was also pretty nice. It was cool to see his thoughts on fighting another Gigas, and the fact that he went out of his way to read up on Megane's story tells us a bit more about how he approaches things.\n\nThey did a lot right in this episode in terms of characterizing the creations.

That being said, I don't think I would ever stop talking to them if they made it big or that they would kill themselves over some internet flame (thanks Steven Universe fandom for making that even a realistic possibility).\n\nWe also now know that a good chunk of the characters were summoned because Souta (and probably Setsuna) liked them. I wonder if her story about Altair was a desperate cry for help to Souta that he ignored."

After the audition she was offered the role of Rui, and she wondered what kind of character was;\n\n- When she got offer she didn't know Rui was 16, she thought he was younger. She never voiced a boy before so she was a little anxious;\n\n- She was happy to work with Aoki again, and she says he looks like a man who pours passion into his work;\n\n- She tried several variations of Rui's voice because she wasn't sure what to do (there were no particular indications), so in the first test recording she used a very low voice, and she got told to use a more neutral tone;\n\n- At first she thought Rui is a \"troubled child\", then she got adjusted to his character after a while;\n\n- She had fun voicing Rui's comments about \"riding a robot\";\n\n- She touches the topic that food (when asked about the \"I'm hungry\" scene with Rui) in the series is very important because most of the creations didn't really experience it for real;\n\n- She liked Rui's portrayal in episode 11, and she was also asked to play Rui in a calm way during his scenes;\n\n- She also liked the scenes that appear afterwards (as in future, not aired episodes) even when Rui fights with Gigas Machina. Also, and it's another tease, she likes the new creations that will be introduced later. "

I could see this going well, but I'm still not really entertained.\")\n\n\n[Other Speculation](/s \"When I was talking about Re:Creators with someone else they started pointing out the fact that the OP and ED are completely different when it comes to their tone. The show begins with everybody being either isolated in their canon world or fighting something off-screen. That's the current place we're in the story right now. The moon getting digitized like the Creations right as the music dropped seems important to the previous theory about Souta, but that's nothing new. The huge shift comes with the ED's setting and interactions though. We see Souta's monitor come alive with a leader and then everybody in an oddly happy way. Creations, Creators, and the world of the gods (aka Japan) are all brought together with Souta being there in every scene. This is where the previous theory comes from, because the ED shows us the story after he literally makes his own happy ending.\")\n\n\nEDIT: [it continues/Madoka Magica Rebellion Spoilers](/s \"Souta mentioned during the fight with Alice that stories and reality are both significant to him, but the natural conclusion is that a rewritten world wouldn't necessarily be desirable if it retcons everything that's happened so far since it potentially undermines some very significant development and events. The aftermath of Madoka's choice is what inspired this line of thought, because Homura experienced two very distinct realities (Megucaverse and Homuverse) with their own issues about not truly resolving something. Okay, done for now. Really.\")"

I just wish her death was more meaningful other than being another nefarious play date for Magane. Her death was pathetic and how it played out turned me off. She told Alice to ask Magane knowing how crazy she is, and didn't use that breath to say \"Altair did it\" just screams plot convenience to me.  \n\nAlice going to fight the good guys and running off with Altair should have been an \"holy fuck\" moment, but it was more like a \"meh, dumb bitch\" moment instead. \n\nFirst episode of one punch man had more impacting of a story than these 11 episodes combined.

It's in one of those scenes that passes by in a couple of seconds.  \n\nSo Altair was very much Setsuna's baby, as it were. She probably poured a lot of herself into creating her, and the accusations of plagiarism crushed her ... so Altair ended up being imbued with Yuna/Setsuna's increasingly toxic mental state.  \n\nSo with that being said, I wonder if there are hints buried in what little of her \"Piclive\" page we see, regarding characters that might be introduced in the second cour.

Uh, no.\n\nThis show is fun (and nothing else), but it really could use a more interesting \"self-insert\" male MC than this guy.
