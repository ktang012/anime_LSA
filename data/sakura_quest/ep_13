But it's a charming dumb that made me love the old man and likely most people of this rural little town if this episode was an indication. \n\nSeeing the pictures and how proud the old man looked, that was so heartwarming. \n\nKoharu only took the job because she was tired of not getting any job and her parents about to cut off the money flow for her. I don't really blame her, everyone has their preference (here Tokyo) but you have to comprimise at some point. She came across as a simple minded kid at first but that changed throughout the episode. \n\nNice start."

All they received was an amount to animate with, but they didn't feel like financially investing in it, so that was their decision.\n\nThere's a lot of posts talking about Samurai Flamenco's \"sales\" (not really sales) and how it doomed Manglobe. Manglobe never financially invested in it. They got a budget and that's it for that series outside of some royalties. Fuji, Aniplex, Kyoraku Industrial Holdings, Dentsu, Hobbibox, Movic, and DeNA were the companies who were invested in it."

It's not common to see them on committees (barring big names: Toei, Pierrot, Sunrise, IG, ufotable, KyoAni), but there are some that are on them, so it's not uncommon.  If I said \"it's not common to see them on a committee\" someone would reply \"what about (insert one of those big names)?\" so I had to phrase it that way to be precise. I'd hypothesize that about 60% of the time a studio is on a committee (and usually at the end of it), but that doesn't give a good breakdown of situation. Actas isn't on any committee. A-1 is usually not on them, but have been in the past. For a one sentence description, the way I phrased it was the best way to convey that subtlety."

   "text": "I think what happened there is that *samui* can also mean \"lame\" or \"corny\" (might be used as a reaction to a bad joke or a cheesy pick-up line).  It's obvious from the context that she's just cold, but  sometimes the folks doing the simulcast translation may only get a written script rather than get to see the actual video, and so a single word like this out-of-context could easily be mistranslated without a stage direction like \"[*Koharu rubs her shoulder for warmth*].\"  And incomplete context like \"[*Koharu looks at some souvenir photos*]\" would actually push the translator towards the wrong interpretation.\n\nI actually found out about this when I encountered [a similarly baffling translation error in Stella no Mahou](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/5dbhtj/spoilers_stella_no_mahou_episode_7_discussion/dccz78a/) (TL;DR: they translated *keitai geemu* as \"cell phone games\" when there is clearly a Game Boy in the shot).  Here's [a short Anime News Network article](http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/answerman/2016-07-08/.103695) on the process, which explains why simulcast subs can get worse as a show goes on (for more details, see Shirobako!).  Doesn't make it any less annoying, but I can't blame the translators for not having the power of foresight.  \n\nOf course, I'm sure some errors are just plain rookie mistakes, but I'd like to give the translators the benefit of the doubt."

Nondiagetic.  Usually this applies to things like the soundtrack.  The characters in the show can't hear the soundtrack playing over their actions, so it's nondiagetic.  If the music is coming from a source in the show, be it a radio or musical instruments or what have you, then it's diagetic.

Almost no young adults in sight.\n* Great MC: Yoshino, struggling with what every millennial is struggling with: whether or not to add mayonnaise to a piece of bread with sliced raspberries (can't even call that a sandwich).\n* Plot with a LOT of potential: The fact that the MC does NOT want to be where she is right now (but looks like she is staying) screams huge character development. Not to mention she's surrounded by a ton of people essentially from a different culture than her. She will learn lots from the old people, I anticipate.

I love the countryside setting as it always has that comfy feeling to it. The scene where she walks into the hall and sees the picture of herself on the pinboard melted my heart. It was absolutely adorable and a fantastic way to end the episode. This series seems to be non-sequel AOTS material for sure."

Honestly, it was one of the strongest premieres I've seen in years. So far it is well written, well animated and very entertaining, with hints of a lot of great characters and varied ensemble cast emerging already. I can see it becoming a genuine classic if it gets better, and an early AOTY contender while we're at it. I can already see myself rewatching this episode later, which is a good sign as it is not something I do often.\n\nI want Sakura Quest to succeed so bad. We need more anime about 20-somethings, we need more anime with female characters who are not there to be objectified. I remember reading an interview with some producer from P.A. Works who mentioned that he really liked the idea of making anime with adult characters, but projects like this are sadly really hard to fund. I guess now is our turn to show support and be as vocal as possible (and willing to spend money) if this show delivers.\n\nFortunately, Sakura Quest is likely to be 2-cour long, judging by the premise of the MC staying in the town for a year, unless there are some significant timeskips involved."

Now that she knows she has history in this town, for whatever reason, she has a connection and  I can't wait to follow this through.  \n\nOut of all the shows so far this season, this is the one that hooked me and got me super invested already. I seriously wasn't expecting to cry, but like I said... That ending song and her putting on the crown there just made me smile and got the tears going :')   \n\nThis one gets  a \"I can't wait\" from me more than any so far. <3  \n\n(also that bag-uppercut was hilarious <3)  \n\n[Her face when she realizes she has history here](http://imgur.com/a/UjoQW) is just so beautiful. Her entire outlook changes in that one picture... She's been trying to leave and run away but now that she's stopped and seen the picture, she's going through the other memories she might have, and just taking it all in for what it is. :) "

   "text": "> Sakura Quest - Episode 1\n\nI'm very big on thematic importance in my anime, and it makes me happy to see SQ diving into its main ideas.\n\nThe crux of the show is about an out-in-the-country town that is trying to revitalize itself. In comes Yoshi, a girl who lives in Tokyo to get away from the sticks she grew up in *and* who hates all things (even the mentioning of) \"normal.\" She's more or less the antithesis to her setting, granting her character contrast and, by extension, bolstering the thematic presence of the show itself.\n\nOn a less-analytical note, P.A. Works does it again with its character designs. The adult-oriented setting is still refreshing, and the OP is a bunch of fun.\n\nI wasn't too happy with the anime revealing the origin of her dream so quickly here. While it was perhaps obvious that she had visited this very same place when she was younger, it seems as though the show missed out on a killer directorial moment by mirroring that one with a similar one in the end (which indicate her change in character and the saving of the town). It *can* still be happen (and I'm willing to bet that something like it will go down), but we'll have to wait and see.\n\nIt's not a stellar anime at the moment, but it's more than solid. Plus, given that Shirobako began in a lukewarm spot before rising to the top, it wouldn't be out of the question to see SQ do the same. :3"

Koharu brings a pretty unique attitude to the idea, being reluctant to stay there but having no other choice.

The show is meant to be dealing with Glorious Nippon's dying countryside problem, and so in a way it's supposed to be a promotion of that rural lifestyle over the urban rat race. So how are they going to convince the millenials that the sticks are actually pretty rad?  \n\nWhat I take issue with is the first scene where we learn that the coronation was Yoshino's most cherished memory and that she has problems with finding herself in the city. This points to some obvious developments where she gradually abandons her ambition, because life in the middle of nowhere is good enough. That's what she felt was missing in her life, and what she always wanted to do and so she will strive to revitalize the place. But what if the targeted Japanese audience does not have these kind of feelings of nostalgia and unfullfilment? I really hope that this route is too obvious to be played straight, and that it's a curveball, and this post will look idiotic 12 weeks from now.   \n\nI guess I want the message to be 'countryside is better than city in this and that, give it a try' rather than 'give up, everything you need is here'. \n\n"

   "text": "So... that made absolutely no sense. This girl had a dream of being a queen, and so she made it her goal to become a queen in contemporary Japan, where queens clearly do not exist? And yet she's applying to be a secretary? And then she just so happens to get a call that offers her the job of \"queen\", which she not only acts like isn't strange at all, but has to be talked into accepting it? And then it turns out she was mistaken for a celebrity who has been dead for 8 years, even though a celebrity's death would be very highly publicized? And the whole job of \"queen\" apparently centers around some sort of renaissance-fair like tourist attraction, which has nothing to do with being a secretary OR being an actual queen?\n\nI had to stop halfway through. That was just... Really, really stupid writing."

   "text": "the girl wants to be special not be a queen, the viewer believes the queen thing to be a dream that is to be taken metaphorically. And she's willing to work for he dreams but on her terms. The celebrity talk is from a cranky oldman who doesnt know any better and is living in the glory days. She got offered the job as one thing she applied for which is sort of like a temp agency specializing in promotional events, and she needed the money. SHe didn't realize it was going to be as rural as it was.\n\nThere I at least tried to explain it to you. Personally I found this first episode to have wonderfully subtle writing with a not so subtle perfect use of dramatic irony.\n\nSeems a lot of really basic stuff just flew way over your head."
