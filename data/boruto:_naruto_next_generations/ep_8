   "text": "Here are some observations from this episode:\n\n1. Does anyone else not understand why a FRICKING INSECT BURROWED OUT OF SHINO'S FACE?\n\n2. So the insects can eat up a hot damned tree in mere seconds, yet Boruto is COMPLETELY fine despite having a ton of the insects creep over him for about ten seconds. Uh-huh.\n\n3. Thank god the anime had the decency to state at last that normal Shino would've obliterated them. If they had actually beaten Shino with him being in his normal state, I would've drown my device.\n\n4. Boruto be like, \"I have almost zero chakra but I can still make 3-4 clones and have one DIG INTO THE GROUND.\" Also, when did his clones get enough strength to punch a hole through the ground? Stupid.\n\n5. Shino can detect a clone below the ground but not a real body below the water. Makes sense.\n\n6. I'm assuming the shadow took away all of Shino's chakra, else he shouldn't have run out of chakra as fast as he did. Yet he still had enough chakra to summon a huge-ass beetle?\n\n6. Electricity works under water. Not only work, but can conduct itself so awesomely that it permeates to the surface. Noted. \n\n7. Maybe I should have noted this in the previous episode, but why did Shino call Shikadai out? He barely did anything. If anything, he should've called Iwabe the rebellious guy, or most likely Sarada,considering a feud between her and Boruto destroyed the whole school. Could've set up some team chemistry without making the affiliation feel shoe-horned.\n\n8. Next episode is about ChoCho. I don't particularly like her condescending voice and attitude, and the episode is probably going to be slice-of-life-filler-level one, but I'll watch it to see if she has some positive character development. I'm also looking forward some screen-time for the dude that looks like child Orochimaru, and some more of Naruto, as shown in the previews.\n\nAll in all, a good episode. There were some logical inaccuracies here and there, but it's not rather a serious episode (even though the most serious by far), so I'm willing to forgive it, also for the fact that Shino got some attention. We need more of older characters like Kiba and Lee too.\n\nSee you next week!\n\n"

In point 2, \"Shino was not himself\" so he just held Boruto and drained him of his chakra instead of trying to kill him instantly. Since episode 1, he's shown that his clones are more solid than Naruto's during the first few episodes of Naruto, with the only problem being that he has way less chakra therefore being only able to summon a few (which is why he can make them more solid because he can control chakra better since he has less). Point 5, he was rampaging with his insects everywhere without controlling his chakra usage (which drains an f ton of chakra). I'm not quite sure about him summoning the huge-ass beetle but seeing Boruto \"barely had any chakra\" but is still able to summon that much shadow clones even though he has a low chakra pool, I'm guessing the \"barely have any chakra left\" phrase has taken on a different standard compared to the first series (which I find kinda hilarious).

   "text": "Well, that was disappointing. Last week, I had hoped that the Shino fight doesn't resolve the way it did in this episode. Plenty of people even seemed convinced that it'll end with an adult stopping Shino instead. They kept saying that Shino wasn't in his right mind in order to justify the nerf, but I don't buy it. Shino had plenty of opportunities to kill the all of them. It would make sense that Boruto and co at least got hurt in the confrontation, but they came out unscathed. Shino could easily overpower all three of them even when he is mentally compromised. That excuse just doesn't work. He doesn't need to use his brain or any strategy to find Boruto and co in a matter of seconds. \n\nYet, the anime pretends that Shino's psyche was so disturbed that he cannot even track down a couple of kids **RUNNING** at a slow speed. He is also quite a decent taijutsu user, and could just beat them in hand to hand combat. How does being \"possessed\" cause him to lose the majority of his skill set? When Shino was monologuing while walking slowly towards his targets, I don't see it as a justifiable in-universe. It didn't appear to me that he was so compromised that he couldn't run after the damn kids. It appeared to me as if the plot demanded Shino to hold back as much as possible. Being mentally compromised is not the same as being mentally handicapped. Shino was the latter in this episode,"
