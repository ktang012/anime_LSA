Yaha-kui has interesting intentions of improving the world, now what that means needs to be seen but i'm intrigued by him. \n\nSpecific mention of 29 days when the passengers can leave. Yaha-kui wants to take Shindo outside though and mentions a 2,7 hour gap. I'm not sure if i understood it right but can he only leave for this time and then needs to return?\n\nShindo realized that he can communicate with him and use his skill of negotiating. \n\nSeems like we got a female counterpart for the humanity outside of the cube.

So in theory, they could copy Shido and make an army of negotiators, but they could only live in the cube. The food can be replicated too, because it stays in the cube, but to put that food outside, it would probably need (2.7/HumanMass)*BreadMass hours (approx the bread is 0.05 kg, Shido is 70 kg, that means 2.7/70=0.0386, multiplying that with 0.05, it would take 0.0019 hours, which is 0.11 minutes, 7 seconds.\n\nIf we don't count the complexity, using this analogue, we get that (I presumed it's Boeing 737-900, 66.36 Ton), it would take 2.561 hours to matterialize the plane. Which is 106 days). \n\nLooks like Kado ain't gonna give back that plane."

It's significantly easier and faster to destroy something than to create something.

Though, the cube itself is animated very nicely, and smoothly, or at least more so than the characters. \n\nI also noticed this time that the music is very nice.

   "text": "It's a really intriguing anime. It's not flashy (though the animation for the cube stuff certainly is), doesn't rely on heavy action and yet it's kind of thrilling. It's a \"What the heck is this thing?\" feeling without feeling annoyed or impatient.  \nIt also helps that the characters here are pretty level-minded and aren't assholes to each other. It keeps the tension up about who's the villain, or even better, is there one to begin with? It would've been boring if Shindo and the rest would be purely hostile because it'd warp the show's direction and bury potential of this interesting cube world they're living in.  \nSo far, I like it the most along with SukaSuka.

The mystery was on point. \n\nEverything is shaping really nicely. This is shaping to be the first CGI show that I'll completely watchm, which is something good. I just now want to see Tsukai in action and see how she is as a skilled negotiator as Shindo is. And of course I want to see what zaShunina is going to tell next episode in the negotiation table.\n\nThis is giving such a huge feeling of Destiny, with the Traveler and such. It is pretty good."
