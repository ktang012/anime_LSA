The proposal scene. It is sweet and yet... sad and sombre.\n\nAlso, this episode pretty much confirms it, that the beasts came from the humans. The scene where Almaria and the kids from the orphanage slowly turned into beasts was unsettling as hell.\n\n***\n\nas for the [lore and spoiler document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpJFH2Z6xoOc48FqWH3zNiP7E_31edhtPRcpzhikbgs/edit), I haven't really gotten the chance to write more, if anyone is actually looking for updates. But I finally got a chance to read vol.ex of part 1, and that gave some new insights and lore etc. I should have something more to talk about within the week.\n\n***\n\nOh, and, for those who are a little surprised/confused as to why Willem suddenly decided to propose, here's a bit from the novel. \n\n>He couldn't protect the ones he sought to protect, he couldn't return to the the place he belonged, he was but a mere shell of a former quasi-brave.\n\n>It was after he met Chtholly, after he came to the fairy warehouse, he finally found a new way to live.\n\n>He has someone he wanted to protect again.\n\n>He has a place he wanted to return to again.\n\n>Willem felt that he can still continue to live.\n\n>He finally realized, he has a reason to live.\n\n>He wanted to make Chtholly happy.\n\n>He wanted to fulfill this wish, so that he can forget about the past, and only think about today and the days of future.\n\nbasically, what has been lost can no longer come back, as the beasts could very well be the ones he tried to protect in the pasts. So, Willem needed to grab on and protect what he can cherish now, and that is Chtholly and the fairies."

Since someone here might have same questions as before I copied/pasted from my previous comments :\n\nQ: How many volumes are the LN?\n\nA: 5 + 1 extra episode. and a sequel (5 volumes)\n\nQ; What is that sequel?\n\nA: It is called Sukamoka abbreviation of \"Syumatsu Nani Shitemasuka? Mouichido Atte Kuremasuka\" = \"What do you do at world end? would you mind to see me, once more?\". Here: https://www.amazon.co.jp/exec/obidos/asin/404104040X/f2664t19-22/\n\nQ: Will the anime adaption cover to Vol.5?\n\nA: Most probably no. It will cover to the end of the Vol.3. The LN author emphasizes that the anime adaptation is \u201ca story of Chtholly\u201d, and not of \u201cChtholly and Willem\u201d. And he also said that he intentionally changed the orders of the title of each episode from volume 3. His remarks: https://twitter.com/a_kareno/status/865637937068650497 \n\nQ: So do we have season 2 for Vol.4 and 5?\n\nA: It depends on the sales of BD/DVD. But currently the BD/DVD sales is miserable. So I don't expect that the publisher will invest for Season 2.\n\nQ: I want to see season 2! What we can do?\n\nA: 2 things you can do. \n\n1, Buy BD/DVD as soon as possible (they will review the sales and determine the next project around Sep).  Me? I already booked 3 complete boxes of BD.\n\n2, If you want to have the 2nd season but not for buying BD/DVD, still you can help - send feedback to the LN author or publisher. If they have got numbers of request they can appeal to their boss. I feel that Sukasuka is a type of anime which is more popular in overseas than that of Japan domestic. If they get numbers of the feedback from overseas they have to reconsider. \nPlease remember, THE LN WAS ON THE VERGE OF CANCEL ONCE BY VOL.2 BECAUSE OF THE LOW SELLING BUT IT WAS REVIVED BY THE REPUTATION and therefore we now can read the Vol.3-5 and able to see this anime adaption. So, the voice from you does matter for anime season 2. No need to write in Japanese, use your own language. The tweet: https://twitter.com/sukasuka_anime  https://twitter.com/a_kareno/\n\nQ: I love the music/songs during the show. OST?\n\nA: OST will be released in 7/12. https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B06Y5SY754\n\nQ: Is there English translation of LN?\n\nA: The fun translation is close to the end of vol.5. People recommend to read  the PDF/EPUB rather than the html to avoid spoiler.\n\nQ: Is there manga/comic adaptation?\n\nA: Yes. But slow pace. Currently it is around the end of episode 3 of anime. Only vol.1 is available. http://amzn.asia/7FLeEoF\n\nUPDATE: vol.2 will be released in 6/23\n\nManga author: https://twitter.com/chimakikaname\n\nQ: The OP is different among episodes?\n\nA: Yes. 1, the color of the letters of the title. 2, the red flash back scene. 3. the color of the ribbons in Elq\u2019s world.  \n\nQ: What is the break-bumper indicate?\n\nA: the pattern of the break-bumper is : blue x [ moving wings x3 color patterns + no-moving wings x3 color pattern ] and then red x [...]\nhttps://twitter.com/folderman_gif/status/867423622909919232\n\nUPDATE: The latest one: https://twitter.com/animisc/status/875032516633141249\n\nQ: Is there a wall paper?\n\nA: Animating wall paper of the break-bumper http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=928378517 The author of this: https://twitter.com/Shino_E8D3D1/status/865929899323736064\n\n(for the previous episode - episode 9)\n\nQ: I like Ithea,  are there more episodes?\n\nA: There will be an audio-drama of Ithea in BD/DVD vol.5. Original script. \n\nQ: What was the brown thing for the gift to Willem?\n\nA: The gift to Willem is TAWASHI. Scrub brush or scrubber. It means you got a consolation prize.\n\nQ: What is the title of the insert song when Chtholly get onboad?\n\nA: \u201cI call you\u201d, will be included in OST."

If only it was 24-26 episodes, then they could make a full adaptation with proper pacing. But alas, what we get is but a shadow of the original novel, even if this anime is fairly good by itself.\n\nIf you enjoy reading books, then I strongly recommend to try the LN. World-building and characterization are many times better in it. And the pacing is slower, which helps with the atmosphere and tension.\n\nThe LN is 5 volumes long, plus there is also one EX volume with side-stories which give more background to some characters. Btw, only first 3 volumes are covered by anime adaptation. LN is currently in the process of being fan-translated and main story, five volumes, should be finished fairly soon. The translation quality is pretty good too.  \nOnly note is if you are going to read it, then you should read from the very beginning. Besides world-building and characterization, anime also leaves out some important foreshadowing."

   "text": "Damn, my theory about Ctholly being the reincarnation of  Lillia took a good blow this episode, but I will keep believing\n\n[](#mug1)\n\n\n\n\nThis episode showed that there is a connection between Elq and Lillia, and it somewhat confirmed that Ctholly isn't a straight incarnation of Lillia, as Elq was shown to actually have existed. \n\n\n[Not that there was any doubt](#etotamadunno)\n\n\nIt was shown that every time Elq said something Lillia was hurt, so when Lillia killed Elq it can be assumed that she died as well (She didn't seem to be in too good of a condition to start it off, and being stabbed usually makes people scream.) Also If I remember correctly the Old man who Willem knew also said something about Lillia dying on a mission.\n\nTherefore I've altered the theory that as Lilliya and Elq died, their consciousness were fused and they became reincarnated as Ctholly.\n\nI will keep believing until it is either confirmed or 100% countered by proof! Until then, I'll keep collecting [evidence](http://imgur.com/a/AbQfC) for my tinfoil theory\n\n---\n\nPrevious theory posts [pt1](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6cvkf9/spoilers_shuumatsu_nani_shitemasu_ka_isogashii/dhy7wjs/) & [pt2](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6e88aw/spoilers_shuumatsu_nani_shitemasu_ka_isogashii/di924g6/)"

They talked about developing biological weapons, so it could just be for war issues that started the research that went out of hand. With zombie apocalypse type qualities it spread into legit carriers which ended up destroying the world. Ok, maybe not the zombie virus spreading, but just basically forced evolution from research. This is why kinslayer is capable of fighting the beasts, since they're evolved from humans, and the fairies also use the souls from humans. As for Chtholly's vision, it seems like she took on the soul of one of those that would eventually become a beast or has the capability of doing so. Maybe just one of them in the research, this is why there is the vision of a heroine coming in to slay her. With the post credit scene, we can probably presume its a beast, and so Willem delaying the tuning of the new sword until after return spells bad news. That again comes back to the first episode's first scene."
