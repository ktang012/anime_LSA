It's just that she was getting really surprised due to her own misunderstanding, and then when the truth dawns she gets a bit annoyed because even if she didn't want it, it feels like an insult that it didn't turn out to be what she thought it was going to be, because it insinuates that she isn't worth considering in that manner from his point of view. You know, 'complicated female feelings' and all that.\n\nEdit: Then again, she does get a creepy-cute smile right as she thinks he's about to confess, so maybe she did kinda want it... or at least a good laugh out of it. Ah well, who knows but the creators, eh? Maybe it'll come up in a staff interview sometime and we can get some clarification then.\n\n> I like the little squeal Bacchus makes just before the credits role.\n\nThe high pitch reminds me of Bell's squeal in DanMachi after bumping into Aiz at the guild."

Charioce still needs to die though.\n\nAlso Mugaro is definitely becoming a top tier trap, and the possibility of cold and clammy zombie romance between Rita and Kaisar is also grand.

I mean, yes, she doesn't want to see Azazel dying, but I don't think she will want to help Azazel once he used her against her will. This will be hilarious.\n\nI see that here are a lot of people confused regarding Mugaro's sex. Well, I kinda imagined she was a girl thanks to the clothes she has in the ED, so it didn't striked me as unexpected, but the chances of Nina just confusing Mugaro for a girl are pretty high, so by now it is unkown.
