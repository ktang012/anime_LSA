Now imagine Boruto with something that can amplify or control his chakra even better. The whole spiel of Boruto is that it's \"modern\". His new friend is basically the heir to the richest conglomerate in the Hidden Leaf. I'm guessing that's not just coincidence. Or maybe I'm just grasping at straws, but that's a way I can see \"science kills god\" narrative happening. Not literally, instead of 'kills' it's 'overpowers'. Boruto being science and Naruto being god in this analogy. But then again, I'm just throwing around conjectures because I'm bored.\n",

      "sadly in the movie they gave boruto a rasengan, a different one, but its still a rasengan.\n",
      "Vert much agree with this, seeing Naruto use Rasengan every fight got old by the end, I really wish they kept the ninjutsu unique and different, I really loved the beginning of Naruto when there were like an infinite number of jutsus and techniques - Sasuke was a good example of someone who wasn't one dimensional, which made his fights cool. Hoping Boruto gets some unique jutsus and is able to become strong without Rasengan.\n",
      "What if he perfects it and makes them much more controlled and with the help of his new bud's corporation, develops some sort of Rasengan rifle? The bullets are his mini-rasengans? and/or with a sniper option. Combine that with his shadow clones, he can snipe a group of enemies at once.\n",
      "people forget Rasengan is one of the most difficult techniques in the history of ninjutsu. I also think fights might be really anti climatic if he just snipes lol, but might be a cool strategy in certain fights where theres tons of enemies. personally i just want him to use more wind style jutsus, its cool if rasengans among those, but just more variety\n",
      "Well his \"Jiraya\" is Sasuke. That's why he'll eventually use a sword. But he has a slight twist on the Rasengan.\n",

      "Naruto did spam this technique a lot back in the days, but that's because Naruto was a seasoned ninja by then. He was constantly fighting and getting beaten up here and there, which makes it quite logical (aside from plot armour, of course) that he didn't get SC feedback as hard as he should. But Boruto, on the other hand, is a student. Not even a Genin. Hasn't even fought anyone for real before this. And to see him abusing SC to this extent with no repercussion is actually quite disappointing, lol.\n",

      "His limit is 3 clones, Sasuke and Kakashi can make about 7-10 I believe so Boruto is still behind the peak. I'd think he'd push above that eventually but not into Naruto range unless what ever powers he may gain supplement his chakra. \n",
      "I hope what they do is have it where Boruto can't use multi shadow clone (at least for a while) and so he can only create a handful of sets (due to having naturally higher chakra pool.) He can compensate this by then using something like his mother's Gentle Fist. \n",
      "I'm wondering if they just added that during his Wind Nature training and retconned it in; I can't remember any evidence of Naruto experiencing fatigue early on in the anime (But to be fair, if he did pull off Multiple Shadow Clone, it was towards the end of a fight anyway, so maybe thats an explainable plot hole).\n",

      "Sometimes I wonder why Naruto doesn't just have Shadow Clones take care of his paperwork.\n",
      "I have a theory that using Shadow Clones for office jobs is extremely exhausting. Even using a single clone for a long period would burn out the user, like working 80+ hour weeks.\n",

      "\n",
      "The difference is that reglar clones are intangible and can't interact with objects. Shadow clones and other substantiated ones (water, wood, clay etc.) have most of the properties of the actual people and can even use jutsu of their own.\n",
      "And what's the difference between someone who can use it and someone who can't? \n",
      "Shadow clone jutsu is more sophisticated and requires more skill to use. It also has drawbacks like the user's chakra being split between the clones and the original.\n",

      "The fight was okay by Naruto standards but it falls pretty flat when measured up to anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Stop right there. By Naruto standards? Naruto has the best fight animation of any long running shonen. It's not always, but some fights look incredible.

It's not exactly comparable. The former have way less time constraints and higher budget per episode.\n",

      "I acknowledge that they're under completely different work loads and schedules and that producing content at the rate they're doing at qualities higher than what they're outputting is near impossible. At the end of the day though, the finished product is what matters. It shouldn't matter to the consumer what kind of behind scenes work goes on. Naruto has objectively worse animation than most shows.\n",
      "If we're talking about what should and shouldn't matter to the consumer, animation doesn't matter to begin with. People watch One Piece and DBS in droves even though Toei, despite being one of the largest, if not the largest animation studio, animates them like ass.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yes, you're right. But it's not a comparison that should be made no matter what show it is. For example, nobody knocks on TV shows for not looking as good as movies do. Not the same situation, I know, but it's still that type of thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the objectively worse animation, for the vast majority of the show, I agree. But they have some episodes once in a while that completely knock it out of the park. Gaara vs. Rock Lee and Naruto vs. Pain are still some of the best fights I've seen in anything.\n",

      "As far as why people still flock to long running shows like you mentioned, obviously there's still a lot to them that makes them worthy in the eyes of their fans. Animation isn't the sole measure of a show's quality.\n",

Like a second project to get better grades. So far its pretty neat but i don't see myself beeing hyped that much anymore after this episode. I also get a vibe that the purple hair girl is the new Hinata. Please don't give us the exact same characters and story in a new anime man...\n",

But Boruto ep. 2 has a much, much better fight scene and all the characters it introduced (Inojin, Iwabe, Sumire etc.) I think are better than Konohamaru, who was my least favorite character in most of part 1. He's shaping up to be pretty badass in Boruto though.\n",

      "I'm gonna get a lotta flak for this but that was pretty awful. It wasn't complete shit but that was by no means good. Chock full of anime tropes (a good chunk of anime is though these days - $$$), a significant drop in animation quality. Everything was very predictable and a lot copied from Naruto. The pacing was way too fast. The original started off so strong because it had great character introductions and a lot of time was spent in the classroom, around the academy, before any actual fighting started. You cared about the characters before they started fighting each other. Iwabe was just the epitome of your typical anime rival, and a pretty shabby one at that. \n",
      "\n",
      "Don't send me into downvote hell! I'm still gonna watch the rest of the series because Naruto. I'm hoping just as much as you that the series becomes a great one.

      "This is so silly when you think about it, because some of these kids are stupidly OP for their age group. Remember even Sasuke wasn't able to make a full Fireball back in his Academy days, and these kids are literally just starting school. These kids are basically ready to take on the Chuunin exam already at this point.\n",
      "Well genin Boruto is probably weaker than Naruto. Only thing i'd debate is that Sarada was stronger than Sakura when they just turned genin\n",
      "Sarada is much stronger than Sakura in her age tho\n",
      "That's what i am saying\n",
      "I'm comparing to early genin Naruto though, before meeting Jiraiya. Chakra pool comparisons are also kind of unfair since Naruto has Kurama. Skill-wise, though, Naruto couldn't even walk up trees early on as a genin and was nowhere near as agile.\n",
      "Because he had no one to properly train him, Boruto has had the Hokage and others to train him from an early age. \n",
      "Boruto can't even walk on water at this point.\n",
      "Neither could Naruto. Boruto can at least use ninja tools to a moderate degree and strategize his shadow clones to do stuff. Remember Naruto was basically done with his Academy days and still couldn't manage a good basic clone illusion.\n",
      "Naruto literally learned how to make shadow clones in the first episode, and he was able to make over one hundred. Boruto seems to be limited to 4-5. which is reasonable considering its one of his fathers best jutsu and both his parents are highly skilled ninja. Boruto is a natural, Naruto was a hard worker with almost no natural talent. \n",
      "Sasuke could. Boruto isn't a Naruto expy.\n",
      "What? Since when?\n",
      "I really don't like how they just had to incorporate an edgy and strong ninja in the class that would inevitably be Boruto's rival, as some kind of mirror to Sasuke. We've seen that now. Something new and fresh to keep the series from living in Naruto's shadow, to give Boruto it's own identity, would have been nice.\n",
      "Adding on to what others have said, he's also there to give someone for Boruto to fight up to, most of the class are below his level with only really Shikadai, Inojin and Sarada being able to fight him and possibly beat him. \n",
      "\n",
      "With this character we had Boruto fight someone stronger than him so we can really establish the idea that strength doesn't equal victory which is important for this series. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also this episode was removing his edge, are we really gonna complain about a character who has strong ideals for 1 episode? Heck I understood where he was coming from, it was quite a logical stance in all fairness. \n",
      "Except he's just a filler character. It's already known that Sarada will eventually end up as his rival and her personality differs from her father's, by a lot.\n",
      "He literally looks like every shitty filler villain from Shippuden too that I've seen a million times.\n",
      "I wouldn't even say he and Sarada are rivals, especially in any capacity near the rivalry Naruto and Sasuke had.\n",
      "He is there just to emphasize how Boruto does not ride on his father's name. \n",
      "throwback feel\n",
      "I don't know why but Iwabe reminded me of Seifer (the kingdom hearts version that is). Maybe it's just the hat. \n",
      "Who is the class rep? And who are her parents?\n",

      "boruto is not as annoying as young naruto and thats why i think it would be so nice to have more of it \n",
      "I love this show, because I always relate myself to Naruto in order to get through the dark times of my life. I like Boruto because it is like watching my own kid growing up, fuck, reminds me of Naruto's academy days. Making me smile man, 10 years went by so fast!\n",
      "Am I the only one who hates that they are actually saying \"ninja\" and\"Academy\" instead of shinobi and (insert japanese word for academy)?\n",

      "This OP keeps reminding me of Kuzu no Honkai and making me really sad\n",
      "They honestly waste so much potential in the \"i'm my own person not my father\" personal struggle. This major conflict internally and externally which was a set up in the the movie (which I'm not sure if it is cannon, please correct me on this) and the first episode for not only Boruto but for Denki as well. After they semi-resolved this for Denki in the first episode I expected the academy arc to be about Boruto earning the respect of the class slowly or classmate by classmate. I knew it wouldn't go as slow as the hundreds of episodes it took Naruto to earn the respect he deserved but come on. One short, I mean really short, Naruto vs Neji esk fight scene later and Boruto has not only earned the respect of his classmates but the Iwara as well leaving no conflict to build on for future episodes. Talk about squandering up a cool reversal of roles where the main character is the literal prodigal son and the rival is the failure. It would have been interesting to explore the other side of the rivalry. \n",
      "This show is going to be compared to *Naruto* for obvious reasons and it is off to a slow start. In *Naruto*, the first 2 episodes sets up who Naruto is, his goal, his rival, and his trial to overcome. I know that *Boruto* is not a carbon copy and should not be however, I don't know if it has as clear of a direction as the opening flash forward may suggest. I've almost forgotten about Denki's weird power thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a general complaint. Denki and Iwabe feel generic. Like really generic. Also, this is a spin off of *Naruto*, unless its world building you don't need to explain basic concepts like chakra. \n",

Although I seem to be taking the role of a cynical source material reader (even if I'm just familiar with the manga adaptation rather than the original light novel, so I'm not a *real* source material reader), who complains about everything being different, it's still great to see someone enjoy the anime adaptation.\n",

Something no one apparently should ever do, but I think the points I have with this are obvious even without reading the source material so bear with me. ^^ \n",
      "\n",
      "Without further ado lets start why the first Episode of my most Anticipated Anime of the season is a total Trainwreck and hopefully just a bad start to a decent show.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let´s start with the Narration at the beginning of the Show. WTF. The Prologue of the Light Novel is also just Narration but hilarious simply because its premise is unique. Like they said the world ended ... but not in a way we all would expect. No. Scientist simply calculated the date for the end of the World wrong and because of this humans no longer have the resources to Trigger a war. The world is also perishing, but so slow that there is no real sense of dread so humans don´t Panic. It really just ends. No big Bang no last struggle just puff over. But then Y appears and remakes the Planet out of Gears. \n",
      "What does our Opening Narration do? It takes all that made the premise unique, dumped it in the trash bin, took the most generic part of the Premis and simply lay it over an Animation of Gears turning. Whop de F****** do. You had the Chance to Animate something interesting for this premise and you chose to not only be Lazy about Animating it (I know Animating is hard work but come on. Turning Gears! My Background was more work than this screen saver) but choose to butcher the setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the part after the Opening with an Action Scene out of nowhere to show us what´s to come. Why? In the Novel they at least tell you why this happens [Spoiler](/s \"we don´t know when this scene will happen until Volume 3\") but we at least know that they are hunted because mere Minutes before they committed an Act of Terrorism by showing of their  [Spoiler](/s \"Power to Manipulate the Tower and thus Manipulate everything from Gravity to the weather\") Thus the Government is obviously out to get them. Making this whole scene much more comprehensible and giving us a reason to be invested in the Story. We want to know why?\n",
      "\n",
      "Next the Characters. Oh boy the Characters. Naoto did get zero Character building. In the Novel we start with his schoolday (in the Anime he comes back from it) where we learn that he is a total Nutjob. He has an Automata Fetish (like most of us After Nier Automata XD) and is a social outcast because he doesn´t interact with his fellow classmates. But he doesn´t care because 100% of his interest lies in Automata. What do we get here ... nothing. Comes Home, hugs a Clock, gets Ryuzu dropped on his Head. Even his special Ability his inhuman hearing, which makes him Interesting and which is important to the Story and his Role in Character Development of the Rest of the Cast, is simply checked off in a sentence. The Rest is okay. Ryuzu and Halter get theirs later in the Story and Marie is currently spot on (Here i hope they change her according to the Story and don´t keep her an ojou tsundere bitch like shows tend to do).\n",
      "\n",
      "The Pacing. **** the pacing. No world-building and after Episode 1 we are 1/3 done with the first Novel. Why? Novel 3 has a perfect spot to end the Anime. You could have a 12 Episode show with 3 Novels in it and enough time to Build the Characters and World. This is just my Theory but it seems they want to cram all of the available Source Material in this Anime.\n",

      "\n",
      "Fazit: I really want to like this show, but with this first Episode I fear they don´t understand what made Clockwork Planet different. Of course, this could turn out like Dance in the Vampire Bund who had a horrible first Episode but the Rest of the show was (IMO) decent. I give them 3 Episodes to show that they understand what this show is about. If they can´t, I won't drop the show, but I will only stick around to see the Train crash, burn and explode.\n",

      "I mean, if your world suddenly explodes, how would you have the ability to remake it out of gears? I can understand desperation, but there are limits ffs. And if you could just REMAKE A PLANET then why not build a bunch of generation ships and sail off to outer space.  \n",
      "But if the end of the world was basically just \"Oh shit, we'll run out of resources faster than expected, better make good use of them.\" it becomes a bit more believable. Still don't understand why gears though, but hey, it's what got me to watch this in the first place so fair 'nuff. I can understand steampunk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still doesn't change the fact that you have city or even continent sized gears rotating around. The noise alone would kill me, not even mentioning what'd happen if a gear gets stuck.\n",
      "I've only read the manga but I was also confused why they left out the school scene since it shows a lot about the MC's personality.\n",
      "I read also the first two volumes and I was surprised how fast they were. Now I know that this wasn't only my feeling, it is a fact, that they rush throw the story. Thanks for the text.\n",

      "It's an especially bad choice for a first episode since anything you show has a diminished effect because you don't have any connection with the characters. There's no context, no sense of stakes, no reason to care about anything on screen. It would have been better if they just cut that completely. \n",

      "It's been awhile since I've watched a show with dialogue that garbage.\n",
      "Quite disappointing, coming here from the manga. Of particular note is how they treated Naoto, the main character. He doesn't sound *at all* like I imagined him, and comes across as somewhat annoying. I do not like this feeling, as I *loved* him in the manga. One of my favorite main characters out there.\n",

      "I was super excited for the anime as well. But wow they started out on a weak note. It was super disappointing how they dropped all world building in favour for cute girls. They know who they're making the anime for and it's quite sad that the material suffers for it.(bonus points that the manga is rushed compared to the LN which speaks volumes for the anime)\n",
      "It seems like it would be a great premise for a manga, let the reader add the details they want. But as the anime it is now, I'm not too sure. \n",
      "Actuall later on in the light novel, he [Spoiler](/s \"has to crossdress to avoid being arrested, made easier by the facts that he has baby face and adolescent voice\")\n",
      "Yeah, one of my biggest pet peeves with anime; having a male character voiced by a female. On top of the wonky animation it really made me want to just stop almost immediately. But, also coming from the manga/ln, I'll stick with it for now.\n",
      "That is fine as long as they are voicing pre teens imo. After that they really need a male VA imo. \n",
      "also coming from the manga, I was awestruck by how this felt like a completely different story.\n",
      "and then I found out it was Xebec.\n",
      ">  and then I found out it was Xebec.\n",
      "\n",
      "do they normally take lots of liberties with there adaptations? i also felt this was pretty different from the start of the manga.\n",
      "For better or worse yes, In my opinion they do. **Nadesico** for example would be \"for better\" in my opinion, but the story is completely different and not as light and funny. It's one of the few manga I've dropped even though I completed the anime series. \n",
      "\n",
      "Conversely, **Mahou Sensei Negima!** (not Shafts **Negima!?**) is much better in the manga as compared to the anime. I'm a fan of both but the anime does each arc in a different order for what seems like no reason and the much darker serious characters in the manga are toned down and given some comedic parts. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I think they're pretty hit or miss for this and was pretty surprised they chose **Clockwork Planet**. They did a lot of the older anime that I still love today like **Love Hina, D.N. Angel, Mahou Sensei Negima, Softenni, To Love-Ru**, etc. Basically anything that awakened my youth. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to continue with the anime I'd recommend not reading the manga or lns first.\n",
      "funny to read that from someone who reads the manga, which is super rushed compared to the LN\n",
      "I've heard that actually, I can't read japanese though and the translations always seem... lacking? Idk how to explain that. \n",
      "Stick to a lacking translation or stick to a lacking story - that is your decision. \n",
      "so either way not the anime haha\n",
      "\n",
      "that being said I'm still gonna watch it...\n",
      "Do you think it ruined the experience w/ the manga? Or was it just skipping over details?\n",
      "There i have to say that I never really read the manga completely, but that is the opinion in the \"clockwork community\". I don't think you can destroy anything. You can always start reading the LN or you have the manga as *your* story and that it is. \n",
      "To be fair to Xebec, after a subpar first season of TLR, they did a good job with it in Motto and TLRD. So I guess I got my hopes up a bit simply because of that.\n",
      "They're also responsible for animating Keijo so I don't think it's fair to look down on them\n",

      "\n",
      "Why can't it have even close to the same artstyle and quality of the poster? :(\n",
      "I liked it, the two main characters are pretty good and i like the premise, the fanservice was not necessary but i am not one of those people who can't stand fanservice, i am okay with it most of the time and doesn't really take me out of the story.\n",
      "I don't mind fanservice at all, but that contract signing scene was... weird. Funny too, but weird.\n",

      "Not with that attitude you can't.\n",
      "This Anime does seem pretty average, but it's probably best to not judge it yet. I will admit the setting itself is very interesting and not a lot about it is revealed yet.\n",
      "The soundtrack is really good but used in weird places (namely the comedy scenes don't have very fitting tracks). The art is trash but the colors are nice. The story is generic and some plot details feel like they are there for the sake of fanservice. I like the quiet moments tho, not a lot of anime have the balls to do that, and i applaud it for that. Overall it's meh or slightly worse then meh so i will be dropping it, although i hope it gets better so i can pick it up again. \n",

I read the manga and there you can kinda excuse it because of the medium, but here definitively it needed another take on all this information.

      "I felt we where moving at 3.000.000.000 kph during the episode. I felt the pacing was really fast and the story wasn't breathing as a result. Ergo, not much time is given to the characters for us to care.\n",

      "Talking into positive things: I liked how they used the CGI, i think it is well used and blends well within the episode. Other than that, the setting is interesting, but that is more of a merit of the LN than the anime itself. Lastly, the plot seems interesting. I had read already a bit of the manga but I didn't went enough to reach to the point of the Military getting rid of Kyoto. It seems promising. At least I am also glad that Naoto isn't the only genius this time around, blondie-chan also is a natural born genius. For these reasons I'll keep watching this show, but it needs to pick up the quality by a lot.\n",

I really hope they don't take the love triangle too far, I just want this to be a beautiful coming-of-age romance, something that's quite rare these days since most romances are either a shoujo, where the MC is a normal looking girl and the guy is a bishie or it's a harem where the MC is a normal looking guy and he chooses someone from the thousands of potential best girls that are into him for no reason, this show has the advantage of being an Original and I really hope I'm not let down.\n",

It kinda made me freaked out at first until I knew it was her sister lol.\n",

      "Holy cow this anime is great! I was initially put off by the genetic setting, plot, character design, and super safe background art, but the way the characters interacted felt so natural that I started to fall in love with it! Honestly whoever directed this is a huge fan of the \"show dont tell\" method, and they are doing an excellent job! Everything from the small pauses to be eye movement totally sold me on the premise that these were supposed to be fully actualized human beings.

The scene at the end where Akane mass-screenshots the lock screen on her sister's phone just did it for me. I loved doing that to my friends when I was in school. Art seems great so far, voice acting is superb, this is going to hopefully be a great show.\n",

It's got a very nice relaxing tone and atmosphere that's really enjoyable as it sets along on its comfortable, leisurely pace. The major two characters introduced so far, Akane and Kotarou, seem to be quite interesting, especially Akane and I'm looking forward to see more of their interactions and development as they inevitably fall for each other. The voice actors are doing a nice so far with some subtle touches that are nice and they've captured their characters quite well. Also I think Chiwa Saitou is voicing Akane's mom which is nice, Chiwa Saitou is always good with some great range: she can go from someone like Senjougahara to someone normal like a middle schooler's  mom, that's quite something ahah\n",

It's got a lot of potential to be a normal, straight and simple romance and I hope it goes down that path. Only thing holding it back is the animation and the CGI although that's probably due to a lack of budget since this is an original that likely does not have a lot of funding.

      "Well, I see her more like a class S yuri. She thinks and worships Aiz in a yuri way, but her feelings are not actually yuri.\n",
      "I think that wouldn't be a problem, if she wasn't so anti-Bell ya know? I think a little bit is funny, but reading the synopsis for under resort with Lefiya and Bell was just terrible, where she's asking ppl about their opinion on Bell and is actively seeking ppl to hate on him but gets depressed when ppl keep praising him or saying they don't mind him. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think that's a little extreme \n",
      "I think that plays into Lefiya still being a teenager. Yeah, it can be bothersome to see that kind of characters on screen, I can totally understand people not liking her, but for me I think she is pretty cute and endearing, always truly trying her best, especially against a wall that we know she can't surpass, that is, that Bell is going to surpass her levels one day.\n",
      "Hmmm I saw the anime first so maybe it's just that it's tainting the other material lol\n",
      "Oh totally. I do think the anime didn't do any justice to the manga, so I recommend you to read the manga, it is really good and each character and conflict has room to breathe, especially Lefiya.\n",
      "\n",
      "You may still not like her, but I can safely say that she is whole leagues better than how she is portrayed in the anime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I must say that the order of the arcs still doesn't change. We do get a bit on the beginning focused on Aiz, which is good, but before anything else we pass to Lefiya's arc.\n",
      "And I still would have gladly chose having that scene over 2 minutes of Lefiya crying. \n",
      "That's actually where I stopped disliking her so much because I felt like \"oh, she's just a really normal girl after all.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, I could have done without the psyching herself up speech taking up time where she could have cast her spell twice XD\n",
      "I think you can blame the studio for this. Both are pretty important scenes in their own rights, but there are many other scenes ahead in the story that conveys better Ais thoughts than the one we didn't get here, and since Lefiya is not central to the story, I guess they decided to go full on her development first.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good choice?, that's debatable, specially when another studio with the same budget and time could execute the scene ten times better than this one. \n",
      "The manga is developed in the same way.  Leyfia will begin to fall more into the background around episode 5 or 6 I imagine.\n",
      "I know the manga is developed in the same way, but in the manga there's time for Ais in the beginning and in the sections after Lefiya's development, that's what I meant with my comment. In this adaptation with all the story they want to cover with only 12 episodes they have to make some sacrifices and move a couple of things, one of which is the dreams of Ais at the beginning of the manga. \n",
      "\n",
      "This only result in, of course, the show that seems it focuses a lot on Lefiya in the beginning, which is the complaint most people have here, and I think that another studio could have done a lot better with the adaptation, there's room for a lot of improvement.\n",
      "Oh yeah, I definitely agree that we aren't getting a lot of the internal monologue from Ais, which i hope starts to change a little, however, I have my doubts.\n",
      "I think we will get them soon as the next arc starts, but we aren't going to get them as constantly as in the LNs/Manga. The cramming is hard with this one.\n",
      "Definitely, I have a feeling they're going to rush a lot in the middle, so that they can reach the minotaur fight and her reaction afterwards.\n",
      "Not only we will get that, but the entire arc as well.\n",
      "It's like they're trying to duplicate Bell's character growth with Lefiya without having seen any of the first season.       \n",
      "\n",
      "Bell grew with every episode and experience and Lefiya just stays the same with this stupid high school girl comedy routine.       \n",
      "\n",
      "Even all the build up to the end of the fight was wasted. Its like I'm watching Akame Ga Kill all over again.\n",
      "I think it is more a issue of time. They are planning to cover a whole lot of the story, too much in m opinion for 12 episodes and of course something that they don't need to do. This causes many problems, one which is that Lefiya isn't portrayed as well as she is in the source. For example, the indirect kiss thing that was at the end of this episode doesn't exist in the manga.\n",
      "\n",
      "She indeed is similar to Bell in many things especially regarding Ais, but, if you read the manga for example, you can see she does have her own badass growth and her own problems different from Bell's.\n",
      "\n",
      "You should read the manga if you aren't enjoying this. It is pretty cool but you will still have Lefiya as much time as she has now with all the chapters that are translated, and even the chapters that comes after Lefiya still has a lot of time until vol 6 in the LNs, which in manga chapters is around... more or less 25 chapters in the future?. vol 7 does equalize the time between everyone and in vol 8 she doesn't make a lot of appearances, giving that time mostly to Bete.\n",
      "\n",
      "The manga does cut out some minor things that happen with another characters though, but until now everything is pretty much the same thing as the LNs.\n",
      "Honestly, the LNs drag stuff out a LOT. People rag on how DanMachi covered the first 5 LNs(excepting the side stories in one of them, so really like 4.5) and they did so without cutting anything relating to Bell's growth and adventure. And even then, if they did, they crammed it in elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sword Oratoria's adaptation however, is eschewing that almost completely. They are shoehorning Lefiya everywhere they can, and really warping her character from being someone who just really admires the higher level adventurers in Loki Familia to this yuri-twisted Aiz-fanatic like Loki. \n",
      "I do think that Danmachi was a pretty good adaptation for what the source material had. It felt pretty cohesive and had an almost constant pace. One could see as how well the Bell from the beginning had come through in those episodes to the Bell he was in the end.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, I do agree that here with Sword Oratoria the adaptation could have been a lot better, specially with combining scenes and changing the order a little of a couple of things, but the thing is that since the beginning, in the source, Ais and Lefiya have this amount of time dedicated to them, way more time than almost all the other characters of the Loki familia combined I believe, and you couldn't tell the story to the point where they want to get without developing Lefiya as a character, and there's the issue that one of her important scenes is tied to an event in the story, so they couldn't just turn around and put it elsewhere. Also, in the source, while we do have an introduction to Ais' story and quest (for the lack of a better word), it is not until later after some scenes focused on Lefiya that Ais story starts to truly roll on. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, I can see the problem here, since if they move important events a lot, the story depicted in the show wouldn't be the story of the source, and that could give the author and the studio some problems. Danmachi and Sword Oratoria are done just as advertisement (Sadly) for the LNs and maybe manga, they can't just change a lot of the story, and since the adaptation of Sword Oratoria will cover a lot of ground with a lot of characters from the start, cramming everything is pretty hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "Danmachi adaptation had an advantage regarding its storytelling, and that is that Bell is basically alone for the first episodes, with Hestia being there and there, and by the end of the show we have 3 well developed characters that are Bell, Lily and Welf, and the others that aren't that well developed but we can relate to, specially Mikoto. The adaptation carefully started to include more and more characters and depict they relation with Bell before moving on to the next new one. Here in Sword Oratoria we have a large cast from the start, which from the very source two have major screentime from the beginning, which are Ais and Lefiya, and the others which together have the other half of the screentime. Sword Oratoria needs to cover a lot of ground and cover for a lot of characters, specially the ones that move forward the story at the beginning, and that's why I think they are focusing first on Lefiya so when Rivira act kicks in we can focus on Ais fully, and then have these two balance the screentime between them and the Loki familia until the end. \n",
      "\n",
      "It could have been a lot better, yeah, but it is not easy to balance all of these factors from a story that already is set in stone.\n",
      "\n",
      "I agree with you in something, I don't like that they turned Lefiya into a Loki-type-fanatic of Ais just to use Yuri-bait. She had her own more normal ways to admire Ais, which is sad to see that they cut just to put yuri-bait.\n",
      "What the fuck, they cut aiz seeing bell after the fight to put indirect kiss crap ? It's obvious the director is trying to appeal to the yuri fanbase, the last three episodes are nothing more than yuri bait. I will stick to the main series\n",

      "\n",
      "I think they skipped some inner thoughts and monologues of Ais in the beginning until we get to certain events later on.

      "\n",

      "I didn't enjoy the beginning of the manga or this show, however I did start enjoying the manga later on when Lefiya started being competent and the focus shifted away from her. The magic chant this episode was sorta enjoyable, so my expectation is that, unless they throw in a lot more unnecessary yuri, it might turn around.\n",

The attack is supposed to disable her. That's the important part, because Lefiya is supposed to pull herself together and braved herself to move and save the other 3 who were in a pinch.

Of course, if there isn't a payoff or something interesting in the next two episodes I'll consider dropping it, but the show seems keen on this Lefiya character to be a sort of Bell, and Dionysus to be her Freya. How it will relate to the story of the main heroine (which is and so obviously has to be Ais as the show is set up) I don't know.

She looks up to Aiz, but she doesn't adore her like she seems to in this. She doesn't get her motivation from wanting to catch up to Aiz, but more from wanting to be useful and not be a burden.

Sometimes it's unavoidable, but in this case I was able to get a clean stitch by advancing a few more frames until her hips settled before taking the lower screencap.  Other times, you might have to pay attention to a cycling animation (a common example is flowing hair or clothes) and make sure you take each capture during the same point in the animation.

      "Basically, Class A is the Hero course, and Class B is part of general studies, along with some of the other classes on the different courses. Since A is specialized in Hero training, they do have a better chance of becoming pro heroes, or at least the spotlight is on them more often because they are expected to be heroes in the making. \n",

      "Yeah, I thought he was in 1-B too until my recent re-read of the arc. I think it's an easy assumption to make as we're introduced Hitoshi and Tetsutetsu Tetsutetsu at the same time, and Hitoshi seems to get more of the spotlight for a lot of the arc.\n",
      "Ooook. So Hitoshi is in general studies, but not class B? Tetsutetsu is in class B, which is hero and not general? I tried flipping through volumes 4 and 3 just to see, and I thought I had it figured out. :P\n",
      "Class B is just the other hero class, they're not (inherently) any worse. Business and Support classes aren't aiming to be heroes in the first place, General kids are sometimes there for other things but most are aiming to get a spot in the hero course.\n",
      "No. Class A and B are both hero courses and have equal chances of being pros, class A just gets more hype because of what happenned in the USJ. The other classes are either in management course, that is a course for managers of heroes, in support course, that is course for people that makes the gadgets that the heroes use, and in general department, that is just normal high school.\n",

      "I AM SO HYPE! Also yeah, half and half guy's quirk is easily the strongest in the show yet. My major issue with this show is just how boring the MC's quirk is. It's just being strong sometimes. It's so dull. Why could we have the bird guy, or something like that that's at least more interesting. I love him as a person though of course. \n",
      "Lol seriously? I think you should rewatch season 1. Izuku just got these powers from All Might and you seriously think he can use it like that? This show is partly about him progressing and getting beter in using his quirk. Yes it's slowly, but that is what i like about it. I already have Dragon ball for that kind of action.\n",
      "He can use it like what? Are you talking about how he can't use it to it's full potential? Cause I noticed that, which makes no difference. Other people people saying that he does something creative here, but unless I'm completely missing something in S1, his power is just punching hard.\n",
      "If you noticed, but All Might is that one character that is extremely op (yes he is slowly losing that power). They are not going to make 1 of the mc's extremely op right of the bat. And no it's not just punching hard, especially not since Izuku needed to start from scratch, learning to control his power. Since he is afraid of using his power because of destroying his own body. And that is what i mean with progressing. There will be moments where he gets better in controlling his quirk and those moments are pretty well done (in my eyes).\n",
      "Also the pacing of this show is good how it is, because this way they can already make season 3 and 4, maybe even a season 5 with how far the manga is. And it also feels like they can keep up the quality this high because of this pacing.\n",

      "I get his arrogance, but Bakugou's anger doesn't even make sense to me. Maybe they haven't revealed enough of his backstory yet, but what we've seen so far is that his talent has been praised and acknowledged his entire life, and yet he's always been angry at weird little things like Deku being weak and not having a quirk. It'd make more sense if Todoroki had his personality given that he clearly has daddy issues (and I doubt they'll go the same route with Bakugou's past).\n",
      "Yeah, he just feels very odd to me. Like he's 1 hair in his noodles away from snapping and murdering everyone within a 100ft radius of him. He just gives off 'villain in training' vibes to me more than 'young hero'. \n",
      "His anger stems from his arrogance. He absolutely hates being pitied, and takes being saved by someone weaker to be an insult. He's been praised and built up so much all his life that he can't take any criticism or the slightest hint that he might not be as good as he thinks he is or wants to be.\n",

      "\n",
      "I really don't get all the hype, really. Season 1 was mediocre at best. Even Bleach had a better plot and characters but I guess as long as it's animated by either Bones or Madhouse r/anime is gonna like it even though the plot sucks and the \"underdog has a dream\" trope was done way better by other anime in the past.\n",
      "Pretty much. It is mediocre in every way: in fights, side characters development, the comedy  and a lot of series before did a better job. And it is treating heroism very bad.\n",
      "Yeah, I agree. The underlying plot with the League of Villains trying to kill All Might is pretty basic, and the school stuff more or less writes itself. The drama seems kinda forced at times. Most of the internal monologues are eye-rolling. It feels like a fan's love letter to American superheroes and Japanese battle shounen with some admittedly great production value backing it. I've seen some people say that it executes its tropes very well, but I don't really see it.\n",

      "It's been an entire season and I still have to deal with Deku's shit character. I honestly can't stand weak MC that takes forever to grow into some OP guy at the end and enjoy characters like Bakugo and Todoroki way more. This anime would've been so much better if either of those 2 were the MC instead of Deku, and I just don't understand how people like this guy. Is it cause this many people see themselves in him IRL or something? Don't mean to offend, but I just don't get it...someone enlighten me. \n",
      "Before I answer your question what do you not like about him lol.\n",
      "He just did. Read his post again. \n",
      "I was hoping there was more besides being a weak mc that takes time to grow.\n",
      "Well everyone has their own preferences. I don't mind weak main characters. \n",
      "It's part the rooting for them that is enjoyable. Watching a character grow over time, and seeing them do stuff they weren't able to before is fulfilling. I mean, I almost squealed at the end when Deku had the flashback to the beginning of the series, where he couldn't move while faced with the robots, and how he readied himself for battle without hesitation. Those are the points that make watching series like these worth it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other part is that watching a weak character faced with high barriers gives more space for growth. There's only so much you can do with an OP character, without it turning into a either a format of losing a battle, powering up through stuff like friendship, beating the bad guy, meeting another bad guy, rinse and repeat, or pulling stuff out of the writers asses. With a weak character there is actual room for *character* growth, not just power level growth. Of course, weak characters are not for everyone, just like OP ones aren't. People have different tastes. If they didn't, we'd have the same shows coming out over and over again. \n",
      "I get all this. I have no issues with weak characters unless they are like Deku at the beginning of S1 - immature, useless, and never knows what the fuck he's doing. Of course he's gonna have more room to grow when he's so far behind the basic starting line for most characters, but I'd rather watch weak characters that's already at the starting line with a much more tolerable personality. \n",
      "Deku is a super well written character, I like him because he feels realistic. He was only weak because he had no quirk which was not his fault at all, but he's certainly not mentally weak or weak willed. \n",
      "\n",
      "He has already grown a ton as a character, that can easily be seen with the last scene of this episode. Was there something specifically he did that you didn't like about him this episode? The fact that he didn't understand the importance of the sports festival? I didn't really see anything else to make him seem wimpy or unlikable. He's just not a naturally competitive guy, all he wants is to help people, he knows that if he wins others loose. That's something that having Bakugo as a rival helps him with, Bakugo is the most competitive person possible which ends up inspiring Deku to really take things seriously. You'll come to learn Todoroki isn't really a naturally competitive person either. \n",
      "\n",
      "Are you trying to say you would rather have a MC that starts OP like Bakugo or Todoroki? This wouldn't even be a remotely similar story if the MC already started as the best. It's engaging to watch characters grow, and Deku has far more growth potential overall compared to Bakugo or Todoroki both in terms of his powers and his character traits. \n",
      "Of course he's grown as a character, otherwise first season would've been an entire waste of time. In this ep it was how he just seems like a pushover in front of Todoroki and then the overly repeated scenes of him having to live up to All Might's expectations etc etc. Maybe it's all this combined with his weird facial expressions that makes me just wanna cringe? Although it's better than the first season for sure, where I had to cringe every time he appeared. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm fine with weak MCs that grow into stronger ones most of the time, even if my preference is with MCs that starts off OP. Off the top of my head, I can think of Eren, Emiya from FSN, and even the MC from DDR. The latter is actually super similar to Deku in how they're non competitive and anti-conflict, but at least he wasn't a whiny/wimpy crybaby? (talking about S1 here) Actually, I'm sure it's all these things combined with how terrible his character art is that just makes him completely unlikable for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, gotta love this sub. Post anything anti-hive-mind and get downvoted. I forgot this sub was like /r/circlejerk v.2\n",

With that out of the way, it'll be interesting to see where the story goes. It has two major improvements over Oreimo, the Sagiri is a softer tsundere with less violent actions than Kirino (tbh, never bothered me but I know it bothered some) and the sibilings here are only 'Step-Siblings' so they can dodge the troubles of Oreimo. So it has the potential.\n",

If the writer writes her terribly or tries to make her as cute as possible, it can feel like she's got less character and is just there to pander to the audience.

I think this is a really good attempt of beginning an anime, it gives more screen time for other future main characters to shine *cough Yamada Elf-sensei cough*.

The episodes without big focus on her were the most enjoyable to me.

When Ithea tries teasing or provoking him, he doesn't immediately go \"EHHHHHHHH?!\" and try stammering around it, he just kinda goes with it. The fanservice is there, but it's tasteful--maybe the massage was provoking with the voice acting, but at least it has a justification that was honestly both hilarious and clever to me. And I'm quickly getting on board with a romance between Chthulu-chan and Willem; it seems only impulsive since Chtholly believes she will die (uh.... yeah, can we not?), but the two have great chemistry together so I can easily believe it.\n",

It may seem odd to say, but the director's handling of the scene honestly impressed me.\n",

      "Really? -stares- Hm. So maybe this scene comes off differently depending on your experiences with massages. Like, I've never seen or experienced a real life massage where it sounded anything like that, so I can only think of sex when she makes those noises, but since you've experienced those noises in terms of a massage, you can see it as totally cool. Interesting.\n",

Is painfull for them, but after you retire your hands, come some relief so, is not that weird. (Sorry for the bad english) \n",
      "I know that of course, but if it's pain, doesn't it normally sound more... in pain like? The only \"in pain\" people I've ever heard sounding like that are in hentai anime, and it's pretty debatable whether their \"it hurts\" is actually meant to express pain. I'm not saying no real life person in pain could possibly sound like they're on the way to an orgasm (masochists come to mind, but there may be others), but it's certainly outside my realm of experience with pain or massages.\n",
      "Its a very complex scene with multiple ways to view it. It is obviously a parody of hentai, but there is more beneath the surface. I enjoyed the scene at least and am interested in watching further.\n",

As it seems like Willem's already from an orphanage, I can accept it a bit more that he looked at the kids similarly to those with him in the past so his shock that they truly are weapons was genuine, but I think that showing him in disbelief first after being told by Chtholly about the truth and reassuring himself that the kids are normal would have more weight to it. \n",

Like her summoning the demon vs her shooting the arrows.\n",
      "Yeah that's how I understood it. You want to set shit on fire. Summon a fire demon of your capability and it will do your bidding to the best of its ability. Magic, borrow on the power of some other shit that I didn't quite catch. It's not as restrained as outsourcing the task. \n",

      "It depends I think. What the demons may ask as a sacrifice may not need to be tied to being physical things, maybe they also could ask for memories or something like that.

Yes there hasnt been any mention of the influence for the novel, but the fact that there isnt any info means its not impossible.  This is the only work by this author and he only started writing after the date of death.  Its just a lot of coincidences.  Which is why saying its like a spiritual successor feels right.  I mean how many other stories are there about a magician of zero?\n",

      "Also in Mahou no Sho [Spoilers](/s \"the reason she is called Zero is because she has a magic that can turn other people's magic null. \"Zeroing out their magic\". She also is the origin for the book she wrote. Almost like the origin mage. The name Zero makes sense given the above.\")\n",

I could not find anything that would imply Mahou no Sho is based off the other or is a \"spiritual succssor\". The reasons for using \"Zero\" are somewhat similar but not the same. Of course they're similar, they're using the same word/theme after all. Just because two authors use the same theme does not mean they are acknowledging each others work.\n",
      "If you actually read the story they are not similar at all. The only similarity is the girl is a mage and her name is zero. The character personalities are completely different. The plotlines are very different. I mean usually a \"spiritual successor\" feels similar, but these feel like completely different stories that just happen to have a magician named zero.

I know Zero and Louise are fairly different sides of the spectrum.  Zero is a grande mage of sorts, and Louise is a failure as a mage.  Personality wise they are different dere but are both quite snarky and playful.  Yes the plots are different but thats not unusual, even sequels to stories have different plots usually so that doesnt have any weight here.  I personally think they feel similar, you may not, but i always did, and i was a big fan of Zero no Tsukaima, having followed it until the authors death.

Both him and the Zero actually had some personality to them which was nice. So far the setup of the story and the world don't seem very unique or memorable, but the story setup seems better than most other fantasy adventures.

It made the episode seem rushed, but really I just think it's something that's difficult to animate.\n",

Plus he's not had any exposure to witches, as in face-to-face contact, and this was the first. So it'd be natural that he's getting to know them more as people than anything, especially since she offers to remove his beastside and what not. It stood out to me that his hatred of witches was only to get positive attention from humans who hated him. (Him saying he's tired of humans excluding him even though he hates witches.) Finally take into consideration that she's actually talking to him sincerely, and he is a bit naive (probably because of lack of contact), while most humans would just ignore or hunt him.\n",

It shows us a bit of the struggles of tourism industry without losing its breezy and fun overall nature. Something about Yoshino is really adorable and fun, and I like her small character story of learning to love the countryside again. The show has plenty of funny and charming moments to stop it from becoming dull, and overall is a really breezy yet fun series that I can't wait to see more of.\n",
      "I like how realistic this show is. The first attempt of reeling in customers with an advertisement page. People watch the video but it's not enough for them to visit a place in the sticks basically. Also while it may have been charming (surely made me laugh), it was a bit amateurish as well. I'm sure, we'll get to see them improve with new ideas.\n",

And the existence of this half-dragon people seems to be a secret in itself. This gives into the question that maybe Bahamut is itself a half-dragon that could have lost control that comes from this village, and as Nina itself when Bahamut transformed it lost control. It is an interesting thing to think about, and Nina is surely a charming MC to look for :)\n",

      "Both Kaiser and Azazel are in the right. The humans are too drunk on their own prosperity to ever care. No one is going to fight for the demons other than themselves. Azazel's kill all the humans plan isn't that smart either. And it would eventually fail, he doesn't have that much power and he knows it. However, Kaiser is off too. He's aiding abetting the very man who allows and promotes all these atrocities to go on. And also he knows all the bad that's happening, knows how horrible it is, and yet does NOTHING. Like Azazel said, it actually make him lower than the people actually doing the real crimes. Even Rita is helping in her own way. What is Kaiser doing nothing. \n",
      "So, right now, Azazel is doing the only thing he can to free his people even though he knows his own power isn't enough. He really needs someone with more power, and also a more calm and meticulous brain. Someone who can plan as well as fight. \n",
      "Lets be honest here, if we were in Kaisar shoes probably we wouldn't know what to do either, but, imo, that doesn't make Kaisar lower than the humans that are abusing and killing the demon race. I mean, he isn't killing demons, that alone would put him above the ones that actually are killing them or putting them into slavery. \n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah, he isn't doing something either, but I believe it is not because he thinks everything that is happening is something just. I believe that he is not doing anything because only killing the humans doing the abuse and the killing would enable Charioce the support of the citizens of the kingdom to kill all demons, and Kaisar knows pretty well that he can do that. It doesn't matter how powerful the Holy Child is, I don't think he can win against a battalion of magic armoured soldiers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kaisar isn't taking the easy way out, that is killing the humans, and that puts him above those humans that abuse and kill demonkind. He just can't devise a plan to save the demonkind without afterward Charioce killing them all, and that puts him even above Azazel, that is just taking the easy way out with a plan that is destined to fail and be the demise of all demonkind in the end. He needs to take a couple of steps back and take a look to what he is doing, and maybe team with Kaisar instead of fighting him so Kaisar would act as some kind of spy and together free demonkind with a fraction of the struggle and problems Azazel faces everytime he goes in Batman mode.\n",

Although an appearance from Amira isn't totally out of the realm of possibility, I think we will have more than enough, especially with Jeanne. It will be interesting to see where she is after the things she did 10 years ago.\n",
      "Im definitely thinking amira is going to either show up at the seasons mid finale or its finale.  One of the two.\n",

      "I like your theory of Bahamut maybe being a half dragon, it would be sk cool to see his human body, maybe he's related somehow to Charioce\n",
      "I'm kind of in the middle with Kaiser and Azazel. Yeah, Kaiser is absolutely right that killing humans will only add fuel to the fire of the hatred of demons, but then again, what right does he, as someone who lives in a society that has benefitted from the subjugation of demons, have to tell Azazel this when it is the humans who are undoubtedly doing much more damage? It's complicated.\n",
      "It is not about the right to tell someone or not. Kaisar tells Azazel to think about the future and not so much on the immediate gain. I mean, if Azazel solely focused on freeing the demon race instead of killing everyone I bet he would be leagues more successful, while freeing even more captives, and posing a question within the citizens that maybe not all the demon race is bad as the legends have told.\n",
      "Although when you also factor in the fact that Azazel murdered humans (Kaiser and Favaro's fathers) for fun as well, it kinda goes down the drain. \n",
      "Given that Azazel arranged the death of Kaisar's father simply for his own amusement, I'd say Kaisar has every right to lecture Azazel on the cycle of revenge.\n",
      "But at the same time, the very survival of a whole race of people is only being helped by Azazel's escapades. Is he to simply sit back and let the king and all of humanity continue, and Kaiser is cowardly doing? Sure the past between Kaiser and Azazel applies to them personally, but should that factor what the lives of an entire race or at stake?\n",
      "I doubt Kaisar's decisions have anything to do with cowardice - the question facing him is where his duty lies. Besides, the whole point of the discussion was that Azazel may not be achieving much to help demons with his random murders here and there.\n",
      "The hand is a left hand, Kaisar lost his left hand. *Thinking..*\n",

So that would imply that MC has a well enough understanding of the fundamentals of magic that he was able to skip 1-2 grades, but somewhere likely near the beginning of his high school experience, there was an event of some sort that put him off of learning magic. I say near the beginning, because of the principals disposition towards his achievements, and how he was only ever average... not what you would expect of somebody who had been implied to have been proficient at the lower level.\n",

That along with the pushing of the teacher role, and his strong recommendation by the other lady whom appears to be held in some high regard, inclines me to believe that the point of putting him into this position is to get him to accept magic as a part of his life. As if he were a student, he could merely shrug off his studies. Whereas as a teacher, he's going to be required to be able to explain to and teach students eventually, and so it is much less avoidable.\n",

Most of the characters had little to no personality to them, the battle system was pretty basic and uninspired, and the way tons of exposition was shoved in wasn't really a sign of good writing.

Under this defintion characters like Asuka Langley or Hinata from 3-Gatsu no Lion would have no personality based on their first episode (two characters I like btw) because they are introduced as standoff tsundere and friendly genki girl.  I feel like personality goes beyond simply describing the character under a trope, it should incorporate how that character reacts to the differnt situations around them, how they treat the different people around them, and a basis on why they act the way they do.

You see, a good character would reflect his/her beef during the series if he felt neglected throught his/her childhood, something that never happened to the MC. If it was a lie, Eriri just like the rest of the cast is a unidimensional cardboard character restricted to the dumb-down harem rule of being in love with the MC no matter what. A good written multidimensional character would recognize her traits (being a profesional mangaka) and say \"screw you and your stupid game\" I'm a reknowed mangaka and can live on my own, she would have some self respect and leave the useless MC with his dick in his hand.

      "There are 3 walls, Maria the outermost, Rose the middle, and Sina the innermost. Each of these walls has 4 little circular extensions with a district within, these are mainly to concentrate human populations in certain areas so they can focus their defenses there since titans are lured towards large populations. Each of these districts has an outer and an inner gate. Note: when I say districts from this point on I'm specifically referring to these districts within the circular extensions on the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "Eren lived in one of the Wall Maria districts as a child, the Colossal Titan destroyed the outer gate and then the Armored Titan destroyed the inner gate, allowing Wall Maria to be breached. When the Colossal Titan attacked Trost district (one of Wall Rose's 4 districts) only the outer wall was breached, so Wall Rose itself was not breached. However, this time Titans appeared within the Wall Rose area itself, not just within a district. This would mean there was a breach in the wall itself, not a gate. The reason this is a big deal is because it would mean the entire of the Wall Rose area itself was taken over by Titans. Wall Sina's area is much smaller than Rose's, so once again it would mean overcrowding (when Wall Maria was breached they ended up staging an attempt at reclaiming the wall just to reduce the population since there weren't enough resources within Rose and Sina, this would end up being a repeat of that). Unlike the time with Trost, there's also no boulders readily available, so blocking off the wall would be much harder. \n",

I guess I didn't realize how vivid I found the manga, so coming across it a second time in the anime it didn't have quite the shock factor for me and felt like it happened faster (reading vs. watching). I just remember it being a really big deal that he died since it was clear how powerful he was and how much of an asset he has been to the Scouts.\n",
      "He honestly didn't stand out to me in the manga at all; I didn't even remember that he was humanity's \"second greatest.\" The anime re-introduced him as \"almost as cool as Sasha,\" who I love, though, so I actually cared this time around. I'm perfectly happy with the change.\n",
      "Why would you even say it was \"bad luck\"? There's no room for chance in a universe where even the weakest of your enemies could kill you easily. Mike committed bad mistakes, after the events of the first season, he should have expected that a \"different\" titan wasn't only different in its appearance, he knew that there were human-piloted titans and that they were more intelligent than the average mindless one. His first mistake was thinking that Monkey Trouble wouldn't try anything new that could catch him off guard, his second mistake was not foreseeing that it would throw the horse even though it already had shown to have a different behavior than other titans.\n",

      "It's been a while since I've read the manga, but if I remember correctly, Mike's death came much later into the breach of Rose. I'm fairly certain he died after Nanaba did, so the arc had been going for a good while and there was an undercurrent of tension that culminated with Mike getting munched by Nosepass and co. At the very least, I'm sure the Sasha and Connie arcs took place first, as opposed to the anime, where they've chosen to open with the big guns and use this to setup the mood and the sense of character mortality properly.\n",

I stopped reading the manga simply because I wanted to see it animated (plus it was kind of hard to read with everything so dense and so much stuff going on) so I'm disappointed that this likely won't get as far as I've read.\n",

If he'd done nothing then the Beast Titan wouldn't have called on the others to eat him, but to him, the situation was completely wrong. By letting the titan leave he was going back on his word, and therefore admitting defeat. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand Levi's Elite Squad carried out how they normally would to cooperatively defeat a difficult titan. They had no way of knowing that she would regenerate one eye faster when they've never seen titans do that.\n",

      "Yeah I think a better word to use would be \"obliviousness.\" They simply didn't know and assumed they could do it. Sadly, they couldn't \n",
      "Yeah, with how language and meaning of words evolve over time; I think ignorance as it is now will be read as willful ignorance moreso than the neutral version of the meaning so obliviousness is the much better word to use in this scenario\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm not so sure about that... I think they die of stupidity quite often. The first time they are caught off guard, yeah it's unfortunate, but after that you should really be expecting that the titans will do unusual things and account for that variability in your plans. They lose consistently to titans, \"good enough based on what we know\" isn't going to cut it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spear-net devices were a perfect example of a good plan (obviously since Erwin was involved :D). They lured the female titan into a forest without having to engage directly and tried to capture her totally hands off. Even when she foiled that plan by doing something unexpected, they gained lots of valuable knowledge with zero loss to themselves other than a few machines. They learned that boss titans can be lured out at humanities leisure, that they want Eren, they can control smaller titans, they can function with the mental capability and experience of a human, that they can harden themselves on command, that the titan hides among their own soldiers, and most importantly, THAT THEY HAVE MULTIPLE HIDDEN POWERS. Counter to how the anime portrayed it, that mission was a HUGE success even without a captured titan.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then Levi's squad decides to take all that valuable knowledge gained, mainly the fact that boss titans have MULTIPLE HIDDEN POWERS, and just totally ignore it to throw their lives away. At one point they even slice out her eyes and instead of leaving while shes blinded they decide to battle her head on. Wtf? Did they just completely forget the part where she was immobilized by 50 spears and they still couldn't hit the back of her neck?\n",
      "\n",
      "There were only two options in that scenario: Distract and run, or fight and win (gamble). If you intend to win you use everything you have and decimate the enemy, but if you intend to run then don't send your best squad into a direct fight with an enemy of unknown power unless your plan was just to lose them and be a troll. What a waste. Levi/Mikasa/the squad + titanized Eren is a pretty strong front, they would have taken Annie out handily. Of course, they didn't know that at the time and should have just left with what they knew, but had they made the choice to fight in the way any smart tactician would have instead of half assing it they would have a decisive victory as Eren beat the face blinded Annie until it was mush.\n",
      "\n",
      "And Mike? I have no sympathy for Mike. An absolutely giant titan is walking by which he knows all the above information about and his first choice isn't to hide and wait it out? If you whistle out to your horse and have it run directly across a boss titans path you deserve to die. They know these things can think like humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Zero sympathy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Erwin seems to be the only one who actually learns things. He realized that he needed to isolate Annie within the walls because something will (and did) go wrong with whatever initial plan he thought up. He gave himself room to work around the variability. Logistically speaking, the losses weren't that bad for what they could have potentially gained. It was pretty much all non-military civilians and I doubt any of it was important infrastructure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Disclaimer: This post was written after rewatching no game no life so it's pretty hyped up over having knowledge over your enemy :)\n",
      "I have to stick up for Squad Levi here.  They were not present while various things were tried against the female titan during her immobilization.  They were ordered to ride ahead with Eren and wait.  They were outside the loop on most aspects of the plan, as they weren't 5-year veterans who could be trusted with the details.  This is actually something of a weakness with the writing, as it makes no sense for them to have been trusted with Eren if it was genuinely believed that any of them could have been secret collaborators or shifters.\n",
      "The word \"ignorance\" can have several shades of meaning.  It can be used in the way you describe.  Here, I take it in a purely neutral way, not condemning some lack of willingness to learn.  I just mean not knowing.  And they had absolutely no way of knowing, just like Mike.\n",
      "Yeh, you're right and from the context of the rest of the phrase it's pretty clear how you meant it. My bad!\n",

      "He had no horse or gear, the Titan stole it. \n",
      "You also really get a realization of how much humanity has been decimated when you take his death combined with the death of the other top Scouts in the forest by the female titan. I mean, if they didn't have Eren's titan formed, at this point humanity definitely is dead...as if in having roaming titans within Wall Rose wasn't enough as well.\n",
      "But the extinction of humanity is also because of the armored/giant/annie titans\n",
      "Oh sure, I just meant more in terms of those parts of humanity that would actually protect them, aka the Scouts. Nearly 75% of the best of the best of the Scouts have now died in like a week time frame in-show.\n",

There's no guarantee that they won't be needed in 3 hours at that point let alone giving them a timespan of years.

I know why it happens, but it doesn't make it any less disappointing to see the switch from the close-ups of characters on horses to the distance shots with the army of CG horse clones.

They were quarantined off on Erwin's orders because he wasn't sure if they all could be trusted since there were 2 shifters from that class already. \n",
      "Ok, so I usually get confused with this format too, but as I understand, chronologically, Conny and the others were bored, sitting down, talking about sneaking out and the titans attacked. Eren and Mikasa had their scene, Armin burst in with bad news. Most of the episode basically builds up to the first few minutes we saw. 12 hours later, they saw a titan at the wall, staring at them. That's what *I* got. If someone understood better, explain away.\n",

At the very start of the series, the Shiganshina district (which extends off of wall Maria) is broken down, then wall Maria falls not long after. 5 years later, the Trost district gets breached, which puts wall Rose at serious risk. Luckily Eren seals the Trost gate with a boulder, so crisis averted. Now, there are only four districts that build off of each wall, but at the start of season 2, where we are now, Wall Rose is breached without the Titans going through any of the 4 districts.\n",

Candles and fas lamps only give so much visibility. Second, although titans are probably sunlight dependent, moonlight is also just reflected sunlight, so it's possible that titans could still be active when the moon is out. Third, the signal flares that the SC use would be rendered useless because of how dark it is.\n",
      "First I wasn't talking about anything like night vision but need usually leads to interesting inventions either way you can train specifically for night time operations. Goal wouldn't be to engage the Titans but to properly recon before a large expedition. Second we have not been told if they are just as active in bright moonlight as sunlight so it is possible but unconfirmed either way, and third luminescence flares would be an easy fix the that problem. \n",

Maybe something like a deal was made with god etc and in exchange people had to resort to cannibalism? But then again so far there hasn't been all that much reference to divine powers beyond the church so... guess will find out either way.\n",

      "Long ago, humanity clashed with gods.  During this time, it was discovered that by having children eat the flesh of the gods, they could absorb some of their power and become god-like creatures themselves.  This ability would be passed down from generation to generation.  However, most weren't able to control this and became mindless beasts that just ran around, trying to kill all people.  So the church exiled them.  The ones that were only partially able to control the ability become the abnormals who look weird and behave strangely.  The larger abnormals that could control their movement and biological abilities (hardening of their skin, growing larger to do things like kick in the walls, etc...), we taken in by the church, trained, and would generally act as shepherds of the failures in exile.  Eventually, some of the shepherds had had enough and wanted to take back their place, leading to a war and the current situation.  Most likely the wall titans are either former leaders of a previous revolt, or volunteers that gave up their bodies to help form the wall.\n",

The new OP makes me think that animals can be titans too. Speaking of the OP, did I see a mother fucking dinosaur in there? In that case it would be interesting how human titans can't speak but animal titans can. And is it smart enough to do research? Otherwise why was it so interested in the squad leader's 3D device?

They were tearing him apart from limb to limb and all he could do was watch himself getting eaten by those savages and scream.\n",

The ONE tried to ignore the commands (showing that yeti titan doesn't have nearly as much control as it thinks it does) and got squashed for it. The other 2 waited around until Miche screamed in anger. Then for SOME fucked reasoning decided to start nibbling at him. Leaving him to scream in pain for much longer than was necessary to get the point across. Titans have NEVER nibbled at someone like this before. They take big bites out of people or swallow them whole. Even the tiny one was trying to fit as much of Miche in his mouth as he could, as fast as he could. The other two were much larger and would have eaten him in a bite MAYBE two. Not letting him scream in pain and terror as long as he did. They extended this scene to try and ad a level of horror/brutality to the scene that was not needed or justified. It was stupid. It shows the glaring inconsistencies the writer and the series has.

      "EDIT cuz a couple more thoughts:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm astounded the writers expected me to remember those side characters when they're all so very forgettable. And jesus I'm all for a dialogue driven series but when the dialogue does nothing for the plot or the characters you may as well devote that wasted time to some decent action. And the only decent action this episode was driven laughably over the top by the scene of \"forgettable side character #27\" being eaten. The level of try hard that was to be edgy and disturbing was actually silly. That scene could have had some punch if I had been given any reason to care about forgettable side character #27, but I had none. All in all this episode wasted 90% of it's time, but at least that makes this series consistent. Also the Beast Titan is downright hilarious to look at so at least that was entertaining, though probably not in the way it was intended to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maybe it's just me, maybe I'm the problem and not the series, because I've never understood the hype for AoT. But I keep thinking \"if it's this popular there has to be something to it! I'll stick with it a little longer!\" and am consistently disappointed. I'll give AoT season 2 a few more episodes before I stop wasting my time and leave it for the people who actually enjoy it for whatever reason. \n",
      "Different strokes for different folks. Suggest you drop, not even 2 more episodes.\n",
      "How could you forget about Mike from season 1? He is the guy that sniffed people! The guy with Levi trying to take out the person inside the Female Titan in the forest. He had smaller scenes too like him being very close to Erwin, questionning him about not telling anybody of his plans before the expedition.\n",
      "Sorry! I don't remember much about the side characters from season one, they were all pretty forgettable to me. \n",
      "Viewership over 9000 \n",
      "To be frankly honest, I didn't quite feel this episode was up to AoT's usual quality standards. It wasn't​ *bad*, it just wasn't epic in quite the way we're used to. Here's hoping it gets better from here, because if it doesn't the hype will have sorely disappointed me.\n",
      "\n",
      "Don't get me wrong, I love AoT and I'm glad to see it come back, but I really hope that the relatively mediocre level of quality in this episode isn't a reflection of what the rest of the season will hold.\n",
      "What about it did you find mediocre?\n",
      "It seemed oddly slow paced, to the point of feeling off. They also seemed to try to cram way too many revelations into the pace they set. It wasn't *bad*, just for an Attack on Titan episode it was kinda meh.\n",
      "I disagree with the pacing concerns, if you want bad pacing then the Trost Arc from S1 is a perfect example.\n",
      "\n",
      "I also don't get how there were too many revelations. Only major thing that was revealed was the ape titan speaking IMO.\n",
      "And the titans inside the wall, and the priest guy knowing about it, and... you get my point. It's all a matter of opinion, of course; I just think the episode was a bit too slow-paced and they crammed a bit much into it considering that pace. Just my opinion though.\n",
      "Well considering they went back 12 hours, heheheh.\n",
      "\n",
      ">the episode was a bit too slow-paced and they crammed a bit much into it considering that pace.\n",
      "\n",
      "Side note: contradiction?\n",
      "Not really. It's a weird distinction, though, I'll admit. It felt slower than it should have been, despite the amount of content, which made the amount of content feel out of place.\n",
      "Curious - anime-only or manga-reader?\n",
      "I haven't read the manga, though I would like to if I have the time at some point.\n",
      "Ah ok. Then you may want to manage your expectations a bit cause anime-wise it has come to a point where there will be a lot more development in the story and lore and less so in action stuff seen in S1\n",

      "I'm glad they retconned the S1 ending. Remember how Erwin was audited and sentenced? Yeah, that didn't happened now. The whole Berserk Eren Titan concept has most likely also been canned.\n",
      "\n",
      "They really wrote themselves into a corner to make it more conclusive and satisfying. I think they should have blue-balled the fuck out of everyone revealing the titan inside the wall the same way the manga did it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They may well do the same thing this season, they have to give it a conclusion somehow.\n",
      "Shit, this wasn't an aprils fool?\n",
      "This episode was freaking hilarious \n",
      "what about it was hilarious?\n",
      "He liked the *blood.* :D Which AoT fan doesn't? It's what the show is founded on.\n",
      "I don't like aot. Also it was hilarious on how the designs style clashes with tetsuo araki Miyazaki's directing style. The titans were so ridiculous the scenes with them looked like a parody of shows of this nature. The same kind of humor that u feel when watching a Hiroyuki imaishi show in an action scene but you know unintentional.\n",
      "AoT a parody? Yeah, no.\n",
      "I did say that feeling was unintentional didn't I \n",
      "Yes, you did, but I disagree. I didn't see it that way at all.\n",
      "Cool but I used unintentionally cuz it was not the creator's intention(obviously that's the definition) and that my opinion would probably not be shared with people because of that.\n",
      "Sure, I got you, just expressing disagreement. Agree to disagree.\n",
      "Sorry for being dickish, if u want to know my more formulated opinion of the ep, I thought it was a strong 5-6 it was barely entertaining but it didn't improve my opinion on aot as a whole. There was a lot of stupid things that made the death stupid. \n",
      "No problem. I'm interested in hearing a more formulated opinion yes. What made the death stupid, out of curiosity?\n",
      "I didn't really mean stupid, I just forgot the word ridiculous, the titans especially mr monkey man were so ridiculous to me I couldn't take miche's death seriously. Also the fact that he went alone made it obvious he's gonna die \n",
      "Well, yes, I agree that some deaths become predictable when the time comes. But that's the case in any old piece of fiction. As for the monkey titan, I just saw it as a further evolution on the titan line, cause I notice they've been getting more dangerous. Regular titans, sprinting titans, colossal titans, and now beast titan. We'll have a titan with human gear at one point, and that's also sound ridiculous. I liked it.\n",
      "To be fair there is some deaths that are unpredictable like ...  in ttgl sorry if u haven't seen it yet, and as for the monkey man, it's not that I don't welcome i,t it's that it breaks the tone of the show and turns it a serious comedy like potato chip and eat it from death note and I'm sakamoto bitch. this term was coined in Bakuman, a great manga, which was written by the duo who made the death note manga. It might not break your suspension of disbelief but it did for me and I don't think tetsuo araki Miyazaki would want me to laugh when a horrible gruesome death is happening to some guy in the show that most people would sell it to others based on the gruesome deaths.\n",
      "I watched three episodes of TTGL and dropped it because it was so- annoying. I think after Naruto ended, I've gotten to the point where I simply don't like the adventure Shonen types that become incredibly predictable. If anything struck me as a comedy, THAT did. So, I sort of see what you're saying, from a personal viewpoint regarding you. Cause others don't see it that way. Makes sense anyway. I personally saw the death differently but agree to disagree.\n",
      "Well, I sat through the first trainwreck. Might as well watch as they keep throwing in more trains. \n",
      "why'd you think AOT was a train wreck?\n",
      "The pacing and the overall not compelling plot. The world is great, but making good characters or fun events seems to not be a skill the mangaka possesses \n",
      "Hmm..thats a good point. However, i disagree. I feel like the characters help bring it together. We've got ourselves a world that has been fucked up from the very beginning. Not sure if you follow the manga, but if you dont, you're missing out. Everything makes sense and in the latest chapter, shits hit the fan on a global, yes, global scale.\n",
      "I do. That is a schizophrenic train wreck that somehow managed to be worse than Gantz in terms of forgetting the plot. \n",
      "But thats the thing tho. The world was set there *in the beginning*. Its not something that kept blowing up around the world. The author had set up hints throughout the series in retrospect.  The human titans are a definite hint since as normal humans they were stilo hunted by Titans. Grisha was known to have come from outside the wall, but where from?  The smiling Titan. The king of the walls and his role in the story. Everything makes sense once we were given a vital point to the story\n",
      "Again, my problem isn't with the world. The world and the events surrounding the world (including the last chapter and establishment of more history) is cool. The problem I have is that Eren and his friends are more boring than watching paint dry, and he's a main character. \n",
      "I disagree the main character is boring. I haven't read the manga (and now watching, I probably won't) but Eren... I find him meh. Mikasa is interesting to say the least though and still wondering about her past, and Armin same thing actually. I don't think I was ever told what happened to *his* family. Then we have the unique ones like Potato girl and Levi. C'mon, they're not that bad. Maybe not as vibrant as characters from- say- Ouran High School Host Club or Chuuibyou but it'll do.\n",

At one point the manga slowed to a snail's pace if you put the snail in a bear trap. Such a mess of backstories and flashbacks and whatnot and no real plot progression, and an progression we got was super difficult to understand during the first read. By now there's probably a shit ton of ground to cover, and there's no way to comfortably cover all of it in 24 episodes, if you ask me (unless the political jargon is cut short and simplified a bit, but then it might lose its hold on the story).\n",
      "\n",
      "Honestly, the reason I dropped the manga was because it got so far outside of its core that it became super boring. Like, it's called \"Attack on Titan\" (roughly), yet it strayed so far away from attacking Titans that it didn't feel like SnK anymore. If this episode is any indication of how the rest of the season will go, we should be in for some excitement, but I'm expecting a LOT of downtime towards the mid-season.

I don't wanna go too much into spoiler territory because I have no idea how to hide spoilers on this website but the politics of the universe really disinterested me in the whole thing. Plus I swear there was a long string of chapters devoted to fleshing out specific characters and after a while I was like \"okay, if the story is gonna take a 4 month halt so we can get a bunch of backstories then I'm gonna shut down.\" And so I did.

The best part is that most of the things that were said in the first few minutes were pointless, stuff we could have seen.\n",

      "For example how much better show would be if we just started from the point of view of main character. We start by seeing flashbacks of him fighting in the past and him saying he was sent to this school because of it. He enters school focused on himself wanting to just have a calm quiet school life, you can add a bit of attitude to him like throwing can into a trash bin from big distance and lazy posture. Suddenly he is surrounded by all those girls with weapons and main exposition dumb would be done by main girl with a more wicked feel to it. Make it feel crazy. Now MC runs away through a window. Mask girl makes a wicked smile and slowly leaves the room. No while MC is doing a commotion in the school you cut into other swordsman while playing their own music themes or better make MC run into those swordsmans. Each of them would have different reaction to him, some would show disinterest, other would be seemingly nice, teasing him, one could be seemingly angry at him… Make it varied and built threat.

      "About writing, like god damn it. I understand they want their feminazi school and femdom undertones, but at least make it make sense in the world. From our perspective it looks like your normal modern society. Giving girls weapons is not out of the question, fact that they start running the school also is not a problem. Problem is when they are aggressors. Whole premise of their rise to power is built on the idea that they defend themselves, but right now they are going around and force fights. MC did nothing that would warrant attacking him, they have no business “correcting” him because he did nothing to cross them. You might say that this is to show how power hungry they are, but then… show it, really show how wicked they are. Don’t present them as just cute girls that need to defend themselves, commit. Not to mention that this was supposed to be modern setting, where are the parents. Adults gave those girls weapons, so when they clearly misuse it, it would be taken away.\n",
      "Last critical flaw of the setting is the fact that… swords? I have no issue with all characters having swords, but they are trying to kill each other. Blood was shed… This isn’t case of quirky school, but just straight up murder and as I have said before this is normal modern setting from what we know. When those girls came at MC he could just refuse and what… they would slice him up? Beat him up to death? Who writes this garbage?! If they assaulted him then he could just go to police, show them sword cuts and say that those guys with weapons attacked him on the first day at school. WHY THERE IS EVEN A CONFLICT HERE?!\n",

      "This show straight up contradicts itself in the first minutes. This isn’t case of girls rising to power via aggression because they had to defend themselves, they were given permission to carry a weapon by adults who then suddenly disappear from story. Premise is built around girls defending themselves and going to far with it (like prison school), but MC never actually did anything…. like at all. Shows tries to have typical modern anime school setting while throwing THREAT OF MURDER AND DEATH into the mix, like… what?

It felt like a big-budget Hollywood SciFi movie with the orchestral soundtrack, military involvement and scientific aspect, but was actually more interesting than most of those I've seen!

I loved how they used actual realistic methods that totally felt scientifically accurate and logical course of action. Stuff like checking for Doppler or IR and targeting the wall's corner were interesting and felt realistic. The CG didn't even look that bad and the directing of the series felt very spielberg-ish and kept me interested throughout. This was one of the most interesting pilots I've seen over the past few series and I was thrilled throughout. I absolutely can't wait to see how this continues, but so far I'm absolutely amazed and intrigued.\n",

      "Episode 1 still had a lot of 2D. Combining both at random ass times is just weird.\n",
      "I'm really liking that sci-fi mystery feel so far. It reminds me of Independance Day, in a good way. The CGI is also pretty good, although the fact that it is only used sometimes is a little weird. I also like the ED, it fits really well.\n",

      "I found it entertaining to watch and it introduced the main character pretty well. \n",
      "It introduces a few of the characters that appear in episode 1 including the MC, though, so I'd recommend watching it. Should be fine to watch after episode 1 though\n",

In my eyes, they did a very good job with it. 3D animation for anime style is something Japanese had to do all by themselves with very little time on their hands in general. Just remember they don't make millions of dollars like US movies so even their equipment could be somewhat inferior.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even then, I can't really imagine anime in 3D to look better than this.\n",
      "I agree. This is one of the better CGI anime along with Knights of Sidonia & others in my opinion.\n",
      "This is the first time I've actively enjoyed 3D CGI in anime. The style is appealing, the animation is smooth, and all of the effects regarding the cube were just gorgeous.\n",

      "(Good job, Toei!)\n",

      "I'm going to be honest, the scientist girl felt like a bit of a slap in the face. But I think that's what they were going for. A bunch of serious politicians just had a depressing moment where they took in the deaths of so many people. It felt heavy, and you could feel their grief. Everyone's wearing darker colours and have darker hair, adding to the dreary atmosphere. But then-BAM! Bright science girl comes in, with bright hair, lighter clothing, and a bright pink tablet-like device, and dissipates the dark atmosphere with some hope that they're alive. It brings some light and hope to a seemingly dark and hopeless moment, so naturally her being bright and colourful and energetic compared to the dreary colours and attitudes of the politicians makes perfect sense to me. \n",

      "No one died yet.\n",
      "I Think they were trying too hard with her. \"Quirky scientist\" must be some kind of trope. I mean she even entered in SLIPPERS. I'd say she's way more quirky than she needs to be, and way more than believable.\n",
      "This is how I saw it in the end. She's an active contrasting figure to the typical stuff. She might be an imperfect character but she needs to be there.\n",
      "I honestly thought she was kind of annoying. This is just ep 1, though. Let's see how it goes.\n",
      "CGI was strange, I preferred the original animation in ep0\n",
      "This was quite interesting and not just because I'm curious about that huge cube...and Takkun's alien character...even though I am curious about both >.<\n",
      "\n",

      "[Kugimiya Rie's scientist](http://i.imgur.com/Ns6EVNP.jpg) reminded me a bit of her role in Punch Line. She seems like a fun character though I think [someone else ended up catching my interest](http://i.imgur.com/ANWAX7a.jpg). There isn't much info on most of the characters yet so I'm still just curious about everyone but I like Yahakui's design at least. Him and Shindou-kun seem to have made some arrangement probably, so looking forward to the next episode!\n",

      "Who knew Toei and Pierrot would have some of the more engaging first episodes this season?\n",
      "The CGI was quite good. Don't know if it's because I've lowered the bar after Berserk or what but it felt pretty fluid and the models were pretty good. There were some parts where it had some fps issues but well, can't have everything.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire episode looked pretty good overall and the story was very interesting. Now this could go to shit very quickly or be one of my top anime of the season. I'm hyped for more!\n",
      "Haven't watched Beserk (and have been told to stay away from it, lol), but I feel the CGI in this is one of the better ones in recent memory.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is going to be a good one. First episode explained what it needed to about the Mc, then got right into the action in the second episode. It's caught my attention, hopefully it keeps it.\n",
      "Episode 0 really grounds the show and makes you buy into the world. It makes you believe that a realistic story about Shindo just being a negotiator could be interesting.\n",
      "Well, I came into this expecting nothing and it ended up leaving a really good first impression. I'm intrigued to see what direction this series will go in. \n",
      "wow, the cgi was nice.\n",
      "So this was a weird one for me. Episode 1 was alright, the genki scientist girl was fun to watch but there wasn't really all that much to it. Episode 0 on the other hand had some great character interactions, a good plot and introduced the world really well. I would of preferred a show continuing episode 0 rather than the switch to the supernatural in all fairness.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that includes the CGI, 0 was hand drawn until we reach the crossover between 0 and 1, now I will say this show is hands down the best implementation of CGI to characters in anime, yet by showing the same characters in CGI and 2D it becomes a showcase of the pitfalls of CGI.\n",
      "\n",
      "Animation and movement is disjointed, expressions lack fluidity and emotion and the overall look creates a strange feeling where characters I took an interest in when hand drawn I found myself not as invested when they were CGI. There's a placebo affect of 2d characters that this style will always lose for me, I just can't get as invested in the world with it. (The opposite is also true where if you present me with fluid movements I find myself getting more easily invested in the world, even if the shows narrative hasn't completely grabbed me).\n",
      "\n",
      "Was it good? I'd say so, probably my least favourite show so far but I haven't managed to catch much so far so that isn't really all that damning of a statement.\n",
      "So this is anime \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\"?\n",

      "Watched the SyFy Mini-Series of that recently. I was also thinking \"Arrival\".\n",
      "\"mysterious thing appears, what do we do\" is a pretty standard scifi scenario. I like this take on it so far.\n",
      "hey Toei Animation with original work, i hope this becomes start of the return Toei's Glorius days \n",
      "I'm actually love seeing all the political organisations coordinate and make decisions. That's why I really liked episode 0 as well. It was also great seeing Mifune-sensei from that episode make another reappearance here, though his assistant largely outshone him.\n",
      "\n",
      "The animation was really well done. I'm starting to believe in CG now that I have seen this. I especially like the animation of Kanata, who came off as a very bright and expressive character as a result.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next episode, we may well have far more of the sci-fi parts, but I'm fine with that as well, as the writers have shown quite sufficiently that they have put thought into the background science, so the sci-fi does not come off as basically magic.\n",
      "After watching episode 0 and 1, it give me a lot of jdorama feel. Super interesting at that. Very similar feel to Shin Godzilla.\n",
      "I got some serious Shin Godzilla vibes watching this. Government dealing with something totally unknown and more powerful than they could ever be. \n",
      "\n",
      "I personally thought the CGI was really nice and expressive too! Not to mention blended pretty well with the 2D animated parts. Can't wait to see where this goes. Also please save Hanamori\n",
      "Let's see if the rest of the world play a mayor role in the plot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Seeing that it following a reallistic representation of a First Contact having the aliens interact with only one country will breack the immersion (althouth, we're talking about Japan, the country that don't give a shit about the rest of th world, and, after GATE, I'm allways waiting for the worst).\n",

      "This is looking to be really good! The CGI is great, really looking forward to next episode.\n",
      "That was really good. the CGI people were iffy in a few parts, but I loved the design of the cube. The whole thing was pretty intense, and I loved that it seemed like a semi-realistic response from the government and scientists. This could be a great series.\n",
      "The red outlines to their eyes kind of bother me.\n",

      "Otherwise, this is an intriguing show.  \n",

      "He brought his Garden of Avalon along. Lets hope that he didn't bring Cath Palug too :P\n",
      "Very strong episode. Great directing and use of CGI that doesn't look too out of place. The sound design was fantastic and heightened the show's tension perfectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Probably the strongest first episode of this season.\n",
      "i hope this momentum goes through, and actually builds a sophisticated story showing the intricacies of the negotiations vs cut scenes\n",
      "I went in totally blind, I've just been checking out everything new and this was really good. 00 and 01 both. I loved the little character introduction in 00 and the way the reacted and responded to the object felt very believable. Hopefully he hasn't traveled to earth because of bad pop music or something. \n",
      "Ok, color me intrigued. I'll keep watching for now.\n",
      "intriguing but this show is butt ugly\n",
      "\n",
      "I am really glad on how they handled the scientist because when I saw her \"loli harem bs\" alarm bells started ringing in my head but she's perfect. She's an assistant and looks young, so I'd place her in late college/uni. Her fast-talking could come off to some as wooden reading from the VA but really it is her mumbling more to herself than her audience while being intensely interested. To be honest, she could have been written as a high-functioning autistic character and be really respectful of it. It would also help explain her choice of notepad too.\n",
      "The CGI is way better than a lot of other anime shows using it, the only time I really noticed was the frozen split second stop, then sudden movement of characters which stuck out a bit.  However outside that, I thought it was pretty good.\n",
      "I agree but seems like such a random comment in reply to my specific comment lol. I didn't even really notice CGI outside of the block/interactions with.\n",
      "Tank drifting!\n",
      "The CGI is annoying, especially on the characters. The story however is really interesting, this show is better then what I expected it to be.\n",
      "The CGI here is far more impressive than it was on shows just a few years ago. A few years from now and we will probably barely even notice.\n",
      "I just watched episode 0, it didn't annoy me this time. I think that I wasn't used to CGI anime yet.\n",
      "The CGI here is expressive and functional, it more than does its job. It doesn't really detract from the show.\n",
      "I really did not like the characters, but it might be because I'm used to 2d instead of the 3d movements.\n",
      "It took me few minutes to realize it is CGI. If it stays at the same level as it is now Im more than good. Ajin was like 12fps and I still enjoyed it a lot and this one seems to be 24fps\n",
      "I hate that kind of CGI, those characters look like dolls and their facial expressions are creepy as all hell... And that Shinawa doctor is annoying... That aside, this intro was quite good. I liked how the government operated, they set their priorities straight and kept their cool. I'm curious what is it going to be about.\n",
      "yeah, the girl really didn't fit in. Everyone else was really serious and she was basicly just there as comedic relief, being completely unproffessional.\n",
      "I liked the fact that she stopped things from getting too stuffy and political by lightening the mood. I think she was still a bit much, but not too bad. \n",
      "With her first scene I agree but with each another scene I see her as woman who like her job and is very interested in what she cant understand. After all she is civilian not from military so she doesnt have to be all stiff and might be a little out going\n",

      "**Episode 0:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Alright so this is about Shindou-san, a Bureaucrat and also known as the toughest negotiator in Japan. Buuut apparently not, as seen by that ending. I went in blind so I had no idea this was a sci-fi anime. Nice to see that we have older/mature characters this season but I didn't expect that end. I guess this episode is to showcase Shindou's skills in negotiating?\n",
      "\n",
      "Also seriously Toei, what's up with the CGI? I understand doing CGI on the Cube and on the Plane but why did you have to CGI Shindou and Hanamori? It's seriously distracting.\n",

I mean it looked good on the vehicles and the robot drone but on the characters? Not so much. This is Toei! They should have enough manpower to fully animate the people and not switch between CG and hand drawn. \n",
      "\n",
      "This show definitely caught my interest! I guess next week we'll see what happened inside the Cube and how Shindou negotiated his way out of it.\n",
      "if it was a cube, we wouldnt be seeing the bottom left facet (given how much of the bottom right side we see), i think the art team just royally fucked up with the \"behind-the-object\" lines\n",
      "It is a CG show like Ajin for example, nothing wrong with that, as long as the characters doesn't look bad and the CG here is quite impressive.\n",
      "But they aren't cgi in episode 0 until the plane, that's really fucking jarring. And after seeing 2d movements of a character then switching to 3d you see how janky 3d character movement is. It just doesn't seem to flow as it should properly. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is one of the better attempts at cgi anime but the difference in movement between 2d and 3d is definitely noticeable. \n",
      "This was one of the shows that looked really interesting to me. I like CGI shows done well, and the PV for this looked gorgeous. Have to wait till after work to watch though. :(\n",
      "\n",
      "At least it's on CrunchyRoll.\n",
      "Was entertained enough to keep my interest, so I'll be watching the next few episodes for sure.  Story has enough of a hook so far with the exception of the female doctor.  She just got on my nerves.  Don't love the CGI either.  It doesn't look bad, I just don't care for CGI characters like this.  Overall though, more things I like about it than dislike right now, so might as well keep it going and see.\n",
      "Not gonna lie, I'm gonna watch this because Yahakui looks like Merlin. That's some good character design right there.\n",
      "Really not a fan of the CGI, but I'm optimistic about the story. Hopefully it goes somewhere and they will be able to develop all these characters.\n",
      "he neotiated with an alien, that mad lad.  \n",
      "looking forward to this show, shows promise for sure.  \n",

      "i dont even mind the cgi, it doesnt look half bad\n",
      "This was way better than I was expecting. Which is great--I really l like how CG shows keep getting better.\n",
      "Very promising first episode! (Well, second episode if you count episode 0).  It had good CG, great music, genuine suspense, and smart characters.  This is probably my most anticipated show of the season, so I'm happy.\n",
      "Episode 0 started off with normal animation then turned into cgi half way through. Weird. At least its good cgi.\n",
      "That was actually...pretty good?\n",
      "\n",
      "The animation was nice though I've never bene one to immediately dismiss CG. The premise seems interesting, and it seems to have some interesting characters (i'm surprised Scientist girl didn't annoy me).\n",

      "Definitely gonna keep watching this one for now to see where it goes. \n",
      "Berserk 2016 take notes how to do CG well. \n",
      "Definitely interesting. Also probably the best \"let's do science and engineering\" in recent fiction I've seen. I could do without the theoretical physicist girl, we are goofy, but not that goofy. 3d people looked weird in some places, the 3d object looked really nice though.\n",
      "I love the Studen professor character, really reminds me of Hanji from AoT\n",
      "Well, what a start, it's too early to say if this anime will be good or bad since everything is still really mysterious, but at least looks promising. Loving the CG animation of this anime.\n",
      "Well that was pretty unexpected. I wasn't planning on watching this originally, but now I'm intrigued. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is easily one of the best (well, the least jarring) uses of CGI I've ever seen in anime. Nothing felt majorly out of place, and it only really felt distracting then they put a CG character and a hand-drawn character on screen at the same time. (Seriously Toei, please don't do that.)\n",
      "\n",
      "The premise was neat, and I like how they showed everyone approaching it in a logical manner. I'm not too sure what this show is actually going to be *about,* but I'm confident that it will be told in a mature and sophisticated way. We could do with less of the moe eccentric scientist girl though.\n",
      "What genre's is this show? Is it action? Is it good?\n",
      "Sci-Fi Political Thriller (Not in the action sense) is how I'd describe it.\n",
      "Ah, okay.\n",
      "One little thing I like about this show is how they just show the names and jobs of the characters without needing someone to give exposition on what they do. That was my problem with Alderamin's first episode, where they spent 5 entire minutes just giving exposition on the MC's team.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physicist girl looks like a bad character choice so far. Genki & socially oblivious are horrible combinations for recurring characters in serious shows.\n",
      "Wow, this may be one of the first times where heavy use of CG visuals do not put me off a series. It was more noticeable at some points than others (primarily with closeups of characters talking), but I'm quite excited to see where this goes! \n",

They're like Musashi Animation in Shirobako, who used to make many titles before the 1990s before vanishing just when the late night anime boom began a decade ago, and then they decide to make their grand return with such an interesting sci-fi premise.\n",
      "So far so good. Will definitely watch it next week.\n",
      "I really wish they'd just decide on CG or traditional 2D animation and stick with one than mixing them, it's pretty jarring, and also serves as a nice game of \"spot the important character\"\n",

      "There's two main aspects of this series that come glaring through from this episode, one of which I hate, and one of which I *loved*. Let's start off with the good.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the biggest attraction of this show for me so far and the reason those 40 minutes breezed by was definitely the interaction between our two main characters; Sana and Zouroku. Both of them have clear and charming personalities that interact and contrast with each other nicely. The dialogue between the two is great, and the show really manages to have a heartwarming side quite well like the scene with the flowers, or a meaningful side like the conversation on the staircase. The interaction between Sana and Zouroku is charming and natural, which really stood out this episode as each scene with just the two of them was really fun to watch.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, I strongly dislike the greater narrative that this show is building. I'm bothered by the mystery behind Sana's powers and who she is, but rather the way the facility is constantly chasing and battling her. The 'bad guys' of the series are really bothersome as the way they're handled isn't very appealing. They're rather standard institute suit and tie baddies with little to no originality to them. I'm not a fan of the Sci-Fi human superpower testing facility trope and it's not done well here. Baddies are characterless industry sunglasses like I said before and don't have any real personality or feeling to them that makes them stand out as anything other than 'the baddies'. I also didn't care for the fight scene in the beginning of the episode and the whole institute SciFi aspect of this show is killing it for me. The powers were handled poorly, the twins are pretty standard 'superhumans the baddies use' and overall the thriller SciFi aspect of the show wasn't done very well. \n",
      "\n",
      "The character story between Sana and Zouroku is done really well and I love watching it, but I hate the institute-y bad guys greater narrative of the series. My enjoyment will heavily depend on which of these becomes the bigger focus in this show: Will it be a character story, or a mystery thriller? Only time will tell.\n",
      "What bothers me is how the cover up was handled. Sure they did some digital manipulation, eliminated the photos, and fixed the damages but that doesn't excuse the fact that tons of people saw the fight AND know what the perpetrators look like. I really hope that all of their operations aren't performed as recklessly as that one was because that would make for the worst secret organization ever. It's weird if they think that the internet is the only way to spread info.\n",
      "Yeah, these are the main things I got out of the first episode as well. The institute has too big a presence to reasonably fade into the background now, but they're really only useful as the framing device for the show's selling points: (a) Sana and Zouroku's interactions, and (b) gruff grandpa dealing with a standard shounen plot. Both of those have real potential. But the institute is being played completely straight and seriously, which so far doesn't seem like the best way to bring out the show's strengths, and only time will tell if they can make it work.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the show manages to give real depth to the institute later, I might come to enjoy that aspect too, but I'm not expecting it. Hopefully the sci-fi plot won't come to compete with the good parts of the show.\n",
      "These are pretty much my thoughts as well. I enjoyed almost every moment that involved Sana and Zouroku interacting with each other, particularly the scene at the shrine. But outside of that, I felt pretty meh about what seems to be the overarching \"chase the runaway lab rat\" narrative. Overall, I'm not particularly impressed with this whole setup. But I'm willing to stick with it for the time being and see how it pans out. Zouroku's character has me intrigued so I'm curious to see what sort of role he's going to play in the scheme of things. \n",
      "In terms of the baddies, I would give it some time. While they seem generic at first, a few things they did could widen them into a more rounded group.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first big thing is the shot of wonderland we saw. Visually speaking, it was a wonderland. While they did control how much food Sana had to control her powers, from the scale of what wonderland was, it would seem that as long as you work for them, they let you run free mostly, using powers as you see fit. \n",
      "\n",
      "As well, how they traveled with the drawing kid at the beginning, while they did need his power to fix the bridge. They had a limousine just to transport him and the girls, and the guy did seem apologetic that he did have to wake him up so early.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may seem like they are generic government lab baddies right now, but I get the feeling that they are not treating the children as badly as it first seems. This could fit into an arc about Sana growing out of wanting to destroy the facility, as we learn that it isn't some cruel place where they torture the children to use their powers, as is often the case in these institute bad guy narratives.\n",
      "Wow I totally missed that the kid was fixing the bridge and the car with his drawings. I was a little confused why he was there at all since they didn't spell it out.\n",
      "Based on what we've seen I suspect that Sana's power can do just about anything. Considering that it makes sense if the facility was a bit stricter and harsher on her along with limiting the food she has even more, which would then result in her hating the facility the most.\n",

      "That just seems really inconsistent.\n",
      "The power looks like standard imagination-based reality warping, so the limitation is more psychological than a physical rule. She can only summon things with chains because it's a limitation her own mind sets on her power. What is defined as a chain is what *she* perceives as a chain. Naturally she'd have to actually believe it and not just declare \"this is a chain\" at something that doesn't even resemble one, and in practice it's unlikely they'll deal with the mechanics of why chains or if she can expand her power to not need chains, so her power will end up working exactly as described.\n",
      "I guessed that their power comes from their imagination at the end of the episode. It still feels really odd that her mind would stop her from creating something that isn't with a chain.  \n",
      "But if she can creates anything that is with a chain just with the power of her imagination, I would expect the bad guys to make her create things with chains that doesn't even exist. They would just need to make her believe it exists.\n",
      "There are definitely better ways to optimise the potential of her power, but they're a research facility and have a lot of Dreams of Alice to work with, so they might not have put much focus on her specifically. Even a powerful institute like theirs has resource limitations, otherwise that woman at the beginning wouldn't be complaining that she couldn't get the computer thing she asked for. So they don't pour in a lot of resources into everything that might potentially have some benefit. Since they have multiple Dreams of Alice, it's fine for her to specialise, because if they need to get something done that she can't do, they'll call on someone else.\n",
      "\n",
      "It also doesn't look like they bothered deliberately shaping anyone's imagination much since their go-to example was giving children some fantasy books and letting them develop on their own. Besides that, the adults are aware that powerful children are dangerous, so an overly powerful individual is not only an amazing test subject, but also a major threat. So it's easier for the institute to control her if her limitations are entirely predictable, on the off-chance she goes rogue.\n",
      "\n",
      "A potential reasonable limitation would be that the object with a chain would need the chain to be part of its normal function, and it would have to actually be functional. That would explain why her created objects are so mundane... and why she can't just create any object with a chain sticking out of it. So if they wanted to make up an object with a chain that doesn't exist, they'd essentially have to design and invent it such that it does exist. This isn't necessarily worth it if their goal isn't specifically to maximise her potential as an asset.\n",

Making the ending utter garbage filled with dues es machina, important characters who the viewers don't even know or understand the goals of, powers that make no sense, and so on. I could make a longer list but there's really no point, in short, it was a train-wreck. \n",

Absolutely love Zoroku as the main character as well, and it looks like it'll be really interesting to see how his relationship with Sana develops. It was pretty cool to see that the episode was 45 mins too. I wonder if that will be a standard for the series, like Katanagatari, or if it'll be more of a one-off, like Re:Zero.\n",

      "The CG cars were bad but the show has definitely caught my interest.\n",
      "Ah, just what I expected. Which is good and bad. The good think is the dynamic between Sana and the old man, whose \"no bullshit\" attitude is very refreshing to see. On the other hand, it seems that there will be no nuance whatsoever to the \"evil government that victimizes special children with superpowers\" trope, which is annoying and a huge red flag. I have a rather high tolerance for choppy visuals, but while the CGI scenes were shit tier, there were some other moments that looked great like Sana entering the flowers' room (which was kind of a good subversion, since he's built up to be some kind of professional hired by the yakuza but he's just a man that sells flower arrangemets.\n",

      "\n",
      "My other main complains are mostly that the animation sometimes is a bit wobbly like in the car scenes and some conversations.\n",
      "\n",
      "However past that we got an amazing premise with a very unusual protagonist. If seen a lot of requests on this sub for anime with more mature characters and very often there aren't many recommendations in those threads. Thats why im glad to see someone like Zoroku. The way he just accepts reality almost immediately and deals with Sana in such a mature way is great to see.\n",

      "First of all, the base premise is generic as hell. Some mysterious facility experimenting on kids with superpowers, and one of them escapes and zzzzzzz... Luckily, the old guy was there to provide a totally unique perspective on the whole thing. He's old, he's grumpy, and he's not taking shit from any of this bullshit sci-fi premise. If the show can focus on him and his reactions to everything, rather than the cliches of everything else about the story, we might be in for a good time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also another thing that separates this from your generic kids-with-superpowers plot is that there's a lot of focus on the systems surrounding the plot, instead of the actual plot itself. The chase scene at the start, for example, was shown almost entirely through background characters looking at screens. We were shown how the research facility functioned, and how they went about trying to recover an escaped specimen, instead of focusing on the girl herself. The same thing happened at the police station, and when we were shown the photos being deleted from everyone's phones. The show seems to be going out of its way to show us how the plot is affecting the people and the environment around them. Which is actually pretty interesting.\n",
      "\n",
      "One obvious downside of that is, that it was really hard to care about Sana herself. I wasn't sure who I was supposed to be rooting for during the chase scene, because there was nothing to make me care about the escaped girl herself. We didn't know her name or anything about her, except for the fact that she's a cute anime girl, and we barely even saw her face. Why should I be rooting for her to succeed? For the rest of the episode as well, she's shown to be bratty and demanding, and not much else. Why exactly are we supposed to care about her, other than the fact that she's an important character?\n",
      "\n",
      "The CGI sucked, as I'm sure everyone is aware, but I also wanted to mention the character designs, which look completely out of place in the sort of story the show seems to be going for. Everyone looks like a character from some 4-koma comedy manga, bringing to mind shows like Yuyushiki or Nichijou, and it makes it hard to take the action scenes seriously when everyone look like they're about to slip on a banana peel or some other stupid shit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, did anyone else experience some awful sound quality? The version I watched was just atrocious. I'm sure it's not the shows fault, just whoever encoded the video I saw.\n",

      "man, hidamari sketch got really dark.\n",
      "Is it just me, or does the research institute doesn't exactly give off the evil vibes? The director guy does have some... apathetic and unethical researcher vibes, but besides hearing about the experiments, they don't exactly feel 100% evil to me. Maybe we just haven't seen enough about the other subjects, but the ones we've seen so far seem to be treated well?\n",
      "I wonder if it's going to be like in [Gokukoku no Brynhildr](https://myanimelist.net/anime/21431/Gokukoku_no_Brynhildr) and they start sending more and more test subjects to capture the with. Then you start to see really messed up ones.\n",

      "\n",
      "Went into this with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. Didn't expect to like this anime so much because the first 10 - 15 minutes didn't really do much for me. By the end of the episode I was loving it though. The interactions between Sana and Zoroku in particular.\n",

      "My biggest contention with the arrangement is having to pay on top of Prime, with seemingly no discount or concession to existing Prime members. The fact that one _must_ have Prime to subscribe to Anime Strike is also a huge bummer (contrasting against, say, offering Anime Strike at a subscription service publicly and giving a discount to Prime members). \n",

      "Prime is good value without Amazon video/strike entirely.\n",
      "It's just kind of the principle of it. I already pay more than Crunchy/month for Prime, and they want to double dip on me just because I like anime. Meanwhile, I can use my Prime subscription to give $2.50/mo to a random Twitch streamer free of charge. I get why they're doing this, but from my perspective as a consumer it's totally bogus. And then there's the frustrations of having to subscribe to yet another thing. The whole point of going with streaming over say cable TV is that it's cheaper. But if I have to subscribe to like 5 different services just to watch some anime I enjoy, I'm still going broke just as fast, I'm just paying slightly different people now.\n",
      "yea, but prime offers a lot more than CR. you are comparing a service that ships you almost anything within 2 days of you ordering it to a streaming site\n",
      "It only offers value if you take advantage of it.\n",
      "bottom line is If you don't think its worth it for you, It probably isn't. For people like me who buy even batteries on Amazon, Its still a great deal.\n",
      "Well I don't have Prime because I'm not interested in it, so even *Hulu* is a better value for the price/selection with the ad-less subscription.\n",

And while there were some decent animation sequences in the first episode, there was also *a lot* of standing around, blathering exposition in such vague terms that it ends up explaining almost nothing about the world other than \"THERE IS A CONFLICT, THE VILLAIN WILL REVEAL HIMSELF\".\n",

      "Of course, it's still too early to say whether any of this is entirely true or not, but the fact of the matter is, the first episode hit just about every cliche marker when it comes to meetcute anime stories.

      "\"Your story is really good and lots of people like it!\" is not even a compliment to the main character, let alone a good thing to say, since the story itself can be attributed to its creator.

Anyway, if Celestia came out of the anime and the narrator has the LNs, then I can't see how she could resist spoilers... although we'll doubtlessly soon encounter the question of whether or not it matters if she knows those things, or if the story as written by the creator is set in stone.\n",

We saw attacks hit real world buildings, but not anyone reacting to danger or getting hurt. If that's indicative of how the reverse-isekai thing is going to be played, then I'll feel like this show is missing out on part of its potential. Then again, the narrator's injuries instantly became scars instead of bleeding when he got cut, so maybe there's something weird going on with how the anime characters interact with the real world. At least it probably won't be a *secret* war or anything if the introductory battle got so much attention.\n",

That surely isn't how first-person POVs should look with glasses <_< other than that, there's enough sakuga to have hopes for the rest, along with some nice use of CGI, and great OST by Sawano as always. Of course this could go south like any show of its ilk tend towards, but there's some intrigue and smartness in what could have easily been a lazy plot as an excuse for sakuga. There's the part about the bespectacled girl at the start, and I'm just gonna guess that she's the creator of the 'villain'. \n",

I'm especially curious as to why the sword mage (forget her name) called our world \"the despicable land of the gods\" and whatnot, although my personal theory is that, looking at it from a characters perspective we may actually come off as despicable.  Take a character with a really tragic backstory for example, for us it's simply a way to explain their personality, motives, create drama, etc.  But in the eyes of the character that had to live it it's only natural they would end up despising their creator and seeing them as despicable people who have no regard for the power they hold or the lives they ruin.\n",

Especially with the main villain, although I don't think it's his creation,  I think it's his sister's creation, who killed herself in the beginning, it's why his house was so dark, mom just sitting watching t.v. alone in the dark, avoiding coming home etc.\n",
      "It is well animated and directed so far, but there is nothing yet to suggest that it will go beyond a collection of LN cliches. It is fair to give it another episode or two to see where it goes based on the talent involved, but there is nothing so far in the story indicating that it won't turn out to be nicely produced mediocrity.\n",

The ideas here have great potential, but I have an overwhelming feeling that it's going to be undermined by the poor execution. This was apparent throughout the episode, and indeed, is also representative of TROYCA's previous high-profile work: Aldnoah Zero. The only question that remains is the amount of mediocrity that I will be able to wade through before giving up and dropping the show.\n",

      "Seems pretty interesting so far. I predict that the main antagonist will be who was originally supposed to be main character of *Vogelchevalier* before the author changed it to Selesia. Being a scrapped character should give the antagonist enough justification to do what she does.\n",

      "\n",
      "I dislike Souta's \"insert-self\" background and personality. Concerning Souta, I do like how 1) he's accepting what he sees instead of annoying everyone by denying his experience and 2) he has a clear cut dream of wanting to be an author, artist or general creator of his own story. These two points are all what I think set him apart from the traditional harem MC I've grown to hate.\n",

      "Idont have screen shots but I really appreciate the fact that the animators worked on tiny details too, particularly on the background. It reminds me of Akira Kurosawa films that employ movement (watch Every frame a painting for an explanation). Even in shots that dont have movement in the foreground, things are busy in the background. It keeps the viewer interested and attentive. Another one is that you see employment of techniques such as the blurring of background and focus in the foreground. Its a normal thing in film and photograph but not seen much in anime except for high quality productions. The selective focusing of the foreground helps focus on whats important. Little things like these really sell it for me.\n",
