The nostalgia gets me too hard with this one."

Famer boy, summoner girl, mages, assasins, flying ships and finally FINALLY after all this years a badass guy with a rifle in a fantasy anime, thanks god steam punk sub genre for making it real, riflemans/ gunslingers are so rare in fantasy anime.\n\nI would want to call it generic, but im still in a personal debate if is generic or old school. The art is great imho it looks ghiblish, the music is great thanks to Nobuo Eumatsu doing the music, is adaptating the video game pretty well wich is rare. I want to look at it as a ode to old rpgs but i suppose this formula is outdated nowadays to modern standards, most people seem to just like Rage of Bahamut type of fantasy or a la Dark Souls or it could just be my nostalgia talking idk.\n\nIm glad you also don't mind ''genericness'' wich isn't inherently a bad thing, even a cliche show can be good as long as its well executed."
