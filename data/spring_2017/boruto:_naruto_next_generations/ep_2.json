My parents up until I went to high school were amazing, but they decided to send me to a private school which meant both of them working later and later and me seeing less and less of them. Sometimes they'd come home at 9pm and go straight to bed, only to be gone in the morning before I got up. Now I wouldn't trade my friends for that other life that could have been, but I can't help but wonder if them just sending me to a public school and leading a more normal life wouldn't have been better."

I hear a lot of people complaining that Boruto is just bitching for attention, but I have the feeling since the movie that it's the entire point of the Next Generations: The world is at peace, so of course the stakes are not the same as when everyone was fighting, just like things in Naruto were much calmer than they were at the time of Hashirama.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that Boruto's problems are any less valid, or that Naruto is a bad person. Naruto is right in his overwork, he not only has to protect the village from crisis as the head of the village, but we also see that he is constantly using diplomacy to make a more peaceful world where, not only his son, but every shinobi children do not risk to die before reaching 12.\n\nBut Boruto is right that Naruto is insensitive. \"The entire village is the Hokage's family\" is one of the motto of Naruto that define him since he learned it. It is the phrase behind all his \"I will become Hokage\" talk that we heard almost to indigestion. But what is an inspiring phrase to an orphan in search for recognition cannot possibly be a good explanation to his son who, we could say, suffers from his father reputation."

So far I find that Next Generation go slowly but doesn't commit any missteps. If you watch this series, read the Kishimoto chapters then watch the movies, you'll find a pretty good evolution of Boruto's character. Right now in NG despite being grumpy he still loves his father and doesn't make the big pranks like he did in Naruto 700, but you feel that his frustration is slowly growing, and when the film episodes will come I think the explosion of resentment will be better transmitted since we would have at least 2 season of events and accumulation.\n\n>It's pretty weird that the previous generation didn't explain anything about their lives to the new generation.\n\nI don't know that it's not that they don't tell their kid, I think it's more a case like \"Back in my time to go to school we had to cross a mountain!\" kinda thing.

Boruto is in no way an overachiever and Mitsuki was just following his lead. The behavior was believable. \n\nNow, the thing you seemed to miss is how it setup the central theme of the episode \"Can they do it differently than their fathers?\" Boruto doesn't want to abandon anyone no matter the cost, if he fails a test so what? This is driven by his father issues. \n\nMitsuki on this other hand is struggling to understand how camaraderie works. Something his father couldn't do.\n\nThe entire scene sets up the last scene of the episode, so I think it was well thought out. Just my opinion. Denki is a glorified plot device though, I will give you that. Though I think you f9cused in on him a bit too much."

He never abandoned anyone. So for followers of the original series-es, it comes off as \"Wait, what, which Naruto are you talking about?\" And Boruto's (the show, not the character) setup for Naruto to suddenly be this person who abandons everyone for work has not been satisfying in the least. The only insight we have into Naruto being an absentee parent is Boruto's grating daddy issues in the form of complaining and throwing tantrums. It makes it incredibly hard to relate to.\n\nAs I mentioned in the previous episode thread the original series setup for Naruto _makes sense_, you can relate to it. Naruto is all alone, he's a village pariah and is treated as such. Boruto has no setup, they just bust in immediately having Boruto act like a spoiled brat and expecting you to go along for the ride. This episode, episode 12, is the first instance we've ever had the show actually try to explain his behavior with Naruto actually acting a certain way and not just having Boruto complain. And still Boruto comes off as a spoiled brat."

Seemed to me they forgot about the time. \n\n> This goes back to Naruto's contrivance of the series: That is not who Naruto was, ever, in the entire original series or in Shippuden. He never abandoned anyone.\n\nBut not from Boruto's perspective. All Boruto hears about is how great his father is, Great Seventh Hokage, the Ninja who ended the Great War, the strongest Shinobi. Meanwhile he can't even keep up with his home life. The problem is that you are interjecting your experience from a previous show. It's not like Boruto the character knew how his dad was when he was a child. From Boruto's perspective his dad *has* turned his back on him. Remember this is a new series with new characters with new perspectives don't project your knowledge onto them and you'll have a much better time with it. \n\nAnd it's very clear he's been absent, even in the movie, sending a shadow clone home for a birthday to have it disappear. That's a huge slap in the face to Boruto. \n\nBoruto makes plenty of sense too though! Of course he is a spoiled brat, he's son to the Hokage, hero of the war, and on the other side grandchild of one of the most venerable clans in Konoha, the Hyuuga. He *is* spoiled. He's also a young child. Geez man, strange how you can relate to begin a pariah and not having father neglect issues. That's rough. \n\nIs it really hard to grasp that not having your father around is a bad thing? Again, all he hears people say is how great his father is but he can't even be bothered to come home. That's where the sentiment \"He's not *that* great.\" comes from. It makes plenty of sense.\n\nI'm not sure we've been watching the same show but it sounds like you're letting the original series hold a little too much sway over this one. "

If they didn't want to carry the baggage of the previous show it shouldn't have been in the same universe and have completely rewritten the personality of the main character of said show with no reasoning whatsoever. Naruto is now evidently an uncaring work-only-matters person, Shino is now evidently a complete idiot.\n\n> And it's very clear he's been absent, even in the movie\n\nI thought we weren't supposed to bring experiences from previous canon?\n\n> Geez man, strange how you can relate to begin a pariah and not having father neglect issues. That's rough.\n\nEmpathy and sympathy are two different emotions. As I said the reason is that Naruto (the original series) sets up the characters much more fully. Boruto throws this giant cast of characters at you with no setup, no backstory, no explanation and says \"Deal with it.\" If you _don't_ take experiences from the previous shows then Boruto is absolutely incomprehensible; they constantly assume knowledge.\n\n> Is it really hard to grasp that not having your father around is a bad thing? \n\nThis would be fantastic for the series if they actually showed it. In 12 episodes they've had exactly two instances of demonstrating this versus just having Boruto whine without context: Episode 11 where a clone appears as Boruto starts his job, and Episode 12 when he has to leave dinner. The problem with that is that the _entire_ character of Boruto is built around these abandonment issues and the writers only medium to show that so far has been Boruto's whining. That is not how you write characters that one can empathize with, it's how you set up a villain."
