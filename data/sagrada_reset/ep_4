   "text": "Wow i was not expecting to see everything come to fruition today!  This is the ideal outcome for sure.  \n\nSo the plan to bring Sumire back to life is a tricky one, needing 4 different abilities.  The power to open the past, the power to share power, the power to change ones self, and the power to turn back time.  All of this together managed to bring a girl back from the dead.  Thats some A++ writing there to make al;l that come together liek that.  \n\nSo Sumire is still 14 i guess, shame we wont get to see her growed up a bit.  \n\nThe little bit at the beginning where Kei realized his plan was going to work and started crying and laughing was probably one of the more unusual things to see him do.  Kei is a guy who through the combination of his ability and his situation, has become a very cold and numb person.  Everything he does is artificial, as he said last ep, he is just playing a boring role in a boring play.  We have never seen him show any emotion really.  Even when Sumire died and he was \"crying\" he wasnt showing it.  So for him to actually cry AND laugh, is quite something.  \n\nAlso what worries me is where do things go from here.  We have already seen this series lives off overlapping timelines to have very complex outcomes, so this is only the begining of Sumire's revival i think, with the climax of it being the end of the season (the half way point since its 2 cour).  So we are still in for some hurt.  \n\nAnother interesting thing they showed was Kei getting his powers and coming to this town.  Its interesting to see his demeanor change after gaining his power and experiencing a reset.  So as my suspicions were right, hes been experiencing Haruki's resets for a long long time, even before he met her.  Thats got to be very hard to deal with, not knowing why it was happening and being forced to relive these days again and again for probably a few years until he met Haruki and found out it was her.  And the way he came to the conclusion that even if he left the town, he would retain his power, that really opens up some interesting possibilities for the future.  We with guy who shares power, Kei could leave town with 1 person and thier power.  \n\nKei's life has really been something.  Left home as a kid because of some situation, traveled to a new town, had his past life erased, gained the power to remember everything, and has experienced 3x the amount of time anyone else has.  Thats another point to make there, Haruki used to reflexively reset when she was sad, so its safe to say her reset was always on cooldown.  If Kei came to the town when he was like 8 (i think it was said he came there 4 years before Sumire died), thats 12 years of time before he met Haruki, putting him at the mental age of 20 by the time he was 14 when he found her.  I guess thats why he seemed so mature.  I would love to see a chart of the timelines of this world after its done because i bet it will be one hell of a web.  I cant wait.  \n\nThis show once again proving that everyone who dropped it are fools.  This is why your stupid 3 ep rule is shit.  \n\n[](#juice1)"

And with how much he min maxes Haruki now, i wouldnt put it past him to have worked up another 8 years these past 2 years.  Its really interesting that he willingly chose that life.  I guess he figures he cant avoid it so might as well grab life by the horns?  That said im sure the 8 years of time AFTER he met Haruki were much easyer to handle since he at least knows the cause and gets to spend it with a waifu like her.  But those 12 years of time before that had to be rough.  \n\nStuff like this is why i understand the MCs personality.  People who didnt like the show dismissed him as boring and artifical, but thats excactly it, he is, because hes been living this life many times longer than others.  Its such a great story element."

She seems to think that somehow it can tell the difference between the \"real\" and sort of \"clone\" her somehow, but can it?  It doesn't seem like he could tell the difference since it's implied that no one else could either, so why would his ability be able to do so?  We don't even really know much about how this picture thing works- are they accessing some weird pocket dimension, an alternate universe, or what?\n\nI think this is one of my difficulties overall with this show, is that there is a pretense of it being this strict, rule-based sort of hard sci-fi world, but there's no serious attempt to explain how the abilities work- they're just magic.  The result is to me, that the problems and their resolutions lack much tension or drama because we never have a full understanding of how anything actually works.  Combine that with the excessive use of dialogue for every purpose, dull characters, and uninspired visuals, and it takes me like 45 minutes to watch a 20 minute episode because I keep dozing off and having to rewind.  I keep watching because it seems like maybe there will be a payoff toward the end, and I feel like it could become a good show if certain things happen, but man is it a slow boil."

It doesn't broadcast to everyone, so it must identify and select its target somehow, so it must be able to tell whether a certain person is Sumire or not.\n\nRight, but how does it do it?  If the owner of the ability can't tell the difference, how does the ability tell the difference?  Could the ability tell the difference between the actual little girl and the cloned little girl in the first couple episodes?  If somehow Kei had acquired the picture of Sumire and managed to bring her out before the other version of Sumire killed herself, and message sender boy used his ability to send \"Sumire\" a message while not aware of this fact, which one of them would receive it, or would both? (For that matter, would it even be possible to bring Sumire out of the picture under those circumstances?)\n\n> Keep in mind that even though this feels similar to a hard sci-fi, it isn't one, and thus isn't obligated to explain stuff scientifically. It outright stated at some point that the abilities defy physics.\n\nI mean, many hard sci-fi novels will have points where they differ from actual or known physics, and provide an explanation other then \"it's magic\" for how it works.  My problem is not that the show isn't hard sci-fi, my problem is that the show seems to want to rely on the mechanics of its abilities to create tension as if it were as internally consistent as a hard sci-fi show, while not actually having that consistency."

If the answer is no, then the two Sumires are different.

However, what I found the most compelling about this show was the ideas it presented. I find the consistency of people's motives to be more important than the consistency of the rules of the abilities. This was emphasized from the first two episodes with the large amount of mentioning that people follow rules. Sure, there are the gimmicks with abilities, but it's not as important for me.

Similarly, people who just go on vacation to Tokyo or whatever... the ability being used to cause people to forget functions on peoples' memories of those, as well.\n\nHaruki's ability moves every quark in the universe (aside from those in Kei's memory centers or whatever Murase wants to be protected from abilities or perhaps some other abilities we've yet to meet) back to the position in which it existed up to three days earlier. The idea that someone else's ability can be functioning passively to make people forget about Sakurada is hardly extreme."
