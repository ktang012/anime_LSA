Online she hides her face...). And he is in love with her (he's made this clear, directly).\n\nUnfortunately both have issues because of the loss of their parents. But it clearly hit Sagiri more, since she is younger. (I'm not sure since the show hasn't been clear, but I kind of get the vibe that Sagiri might have lost 2 sets of parents. Her originals and Izumi family, which I assume adopted her. Update: below I'm told I'm incorrect here.) As an aside, this is also why Sagiri made the statement in this episode \"Be sure you come home\". (She's terrified of losing everybody in her life)\n\nSince neither want to lose what's left of their family, and both are having issues moving forward, they just keep dancing around the issue. Izumi basically says \"I'm committed to being your brother. Family first.\" Sagiri basically keeps using vague statements about her interest in someone she can't talk to. Neither can come out and have a frank talk about their feels for each other.\n\nReally keep in mind grief and tragedy can do strange things to people, that's especially true for adolescences who are on their own. It's perfect natural to shut out the slightest discomfort (as Sagiri does) and play things safe. To maintain some control in the face of utter powerlessness.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, per Wikipedia, (don't know if the show states their ages), Sagiri is 12 in the light novels. Izumi is 15. He could also be trying to avoid a relationship over concerns that it would be improper at that time. With the idea he would prefer to give Sagiri space and time to develop emotionally first. The classic [MC Mamoru Gambit](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-want-to-protect-that-smile).\n\n---\n\nIzumi himself seems like he's not that different that the MC (Kodaka) from Haganai. Who played being dense ( \"eh, nandate?\") because he was trying to have friends over romantic interests. So it was easier to just pretend he was clueless and avoid the issue altogether. Sure it annoyed the harem members, but it avoided advancing any one relationship as to not risk the others."

Dude is whipped af but still she's pretty rude. \n\nPlus her flirting is kinda crap:\n\nMasamune: ay I pretty much love you\n\nSagiri: makes vague comment about loving someone \n\nMasamune: makes dumb guess that she means someone else\n\nSagiri: decides to bitch for a bunch of episodes instead of just being less vague\n\nAnd thinking about this makes her previous comments kinda mean. Like she knows he likes her but when he starts getting hit on at the party she starts yelling at him through the computer \"remember you love me more than anyone even though you think I don't reciprocate it\" so instead of him possibly being able to move on from her she just tries to kill every romantic outlet he has including the one with her keeping him lonely."

Also she seems to have published multiple titles rather than just 1 or 2, she's definitely an outlier when it comes to earnings.\n\nYou're not gonna get a firm figure on how much a LN author makes because it depends on the contract offered by the publisher, which itself depends on the author. But don't expect anything near rockstar earnings. The LN industry is a buyers market in that the few publishers that exist have a virtually endless talent pool to pick and choose from (people who do web novels for the most part) so they can dictate terms: if you don't sign with us for this bargain of a contract, we'll just move to the next web novelist until we find someone that takes up the offer. He gets published, you won't. Of course, most web novelists know it's better to sell their publishing rights for cheap than to not get published at all, so they usually take what they're offered.\n\nIt also doesn't help that Kadokawa, through it's many branches, has a mortal lock on the LN market, which means they can pretty much dictate how the industry works and how much it pays it's authors with no fear of getting undercut by the competition. Authors on their second, third, etc, series can usually negotiate better deals, but they can only push the envelope so far as burning the bridges with a Kadokawa subsidiary means they're probably blacklisted form the company, as which points it's better to retire because where else are they gonna go?"

Her romance with her brother is just so forced ( and creepy ) that it really ruins some moments of the show for me. For example this episode with Elf was pretty good, but part of me knows that MC is still gonna end up with his Sagiri simply because incest is wincest, making the moment feel less important and impactful. \n\n\nAnother subjective reason is that half of the episodes are pretty boring. It feels like nothing is happening in a few of the episodes or it's just going way too slow. \n\nIf those two issues were resolved I'd probably rate this show a 7/10, but as of now it's more like a 5 or 4."

ANYWAY, next episode seems to be focused on Muramasa (whose real name I do want to know, probably something very traditional) so I think they are really trying to sell those two girls just to have a \"Fuck you, I love my sister, but we can be friends\" ending.

The newly formed harem is going to force Sagiri into changing if she plans on ever being seen as a partner rather then a sister for Masamune.

It should have been before the competition with Muramasa, because at least then it'd make sense that Elf still wants to bang Masamune.\n\nShe clearly understands and at times in the previous episodes even feels like she's trying to help the other girls win, as if she sees through all the bullshit they're putting on and is trying to get everyone's feelings out in the air.\n\nBut now she's regressed. She's back to the lovey dovey b-baka tsundere she was at the start of the series. She should be over that and just wanting it be Masamune's friend at this point and nothing more, because she knows both Masamune wants to fuck his sister and his sister wants to fuck him, along with the fact that Masamune regards her as a big sister, at most.\n\nUgh this episode is just a frustrating, shitty attempt to make me care for a ship that's long been torpedoed out of the water. It's not going to happen, you know it, I know it, it's a moot point, Masamune is going to fuck his sister, let's not go through this rigamarole again.\n\nAnd to top it all off, Elf wasn't even hot in her swimsuit. You bring me to an island and a beach episode to make me look at cute girls in cute swimsuits, but her bathing suit is just gross. It's ugly. It's unflattering. I mean, I could kind of see this as her trying to be more \"mature\" and \"sexy\" without the self-awareness of realizing it doesn't look good on her in reality, but I don't even think the show is clever enough for that basic line of thought.\n\nHow you have such a shit episode after the last one that at least made an attempt is beyond me."
