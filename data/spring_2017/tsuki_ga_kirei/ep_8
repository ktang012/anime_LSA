Akane and Azumi are kind of adorable, but Chinatsu seems to have better chemistry with everyone... Like when they are alone together it is painful how they can't even look at each other. While Chinatsu brings Azumi a bit more out of his shell. It's one of those weird things where Chinatsu has totally unintentionally been ruining their relationship vibe, but she's just energetic and likeable and they are so furtive and hamstrung by social anxiety."

Just look at their conversations together, it's usually one sided with Chinatsu taking the lead and Kotarou just answering whatever she's asking him.\n\nEveryone has different experiences but what I think is needed for a healthy relationship (especially if it's your first one) is that you need someone who can provide you a safe space to express yourself. And for Kotarou that safe space is Akane. The bookstore scene alone proves this, he can say more then 3 words when he's around her, he's comfortable enough to open about stuff like his novel to her. He even took the lead and held her hand.\n\nMaybe a relationship between Kotarou and Chinatsu can work out but I don't see it as something that will last."

She could have invented several excuses, like she left her P.E. bag elsewhere, or she forgot to turn in some paper or something else. None of the girls would have stopped her because they were already eating.\n\nSo I'd say that both situations were pretty equal, the only difference is that Akane doesn't know how to speak up.\n\nYou still haven't come up with a way to defend your initial argument that Kouta should have waited for her to finish her lunch. It was an implied invitation to eat to begin with. Waiting for her to eat her lunch and then have her at the library while Kouta should be eating his lunch while she watched would be pretty darn stupid not to mention rude. "

First of all, we could never say \"you should do this instead of do that\" when we are judging virtual characters, what we should do is just think of it with EMPATHY and then we can evaluate them in a reasonable way. \nFor example, let's talk about Episode 4, all the misunderstanding stuffs are to blame on Kouta because he should have told Akane that his phone has been confiscated, it was easy for boys sneaking into girls room in the night and there were also plenty of chance during the breakfast, even at the beginning of the free time, he still have a last chance to stop Akane and explain everything. But it is not okay to say that Kouta did wrong, because there are enough reasons that he cannot do those abrupt things considering his characteristics and the narrative rhythm of this series. \n\nSame reasons for Akane, it is also impossible for her to do the abrupt things you mentioned above, although they are better choices in real life. Think of it with empathy, is there anything that Akane do WRONG in all of the story until now? You said that Akane didn't show up for lunch, but in fact they just made a date in the library at noon, there are nothing to do with lunch. \nFYI, it is seen as a public display of affection that boy and girl have lunch together in Japan, considering the relationship between our MCs, there are impossible for them to do it right now.

For /u/kimbombo is right; Akane has yet to go the extra step first.\n\nNot that she *must*, but, if the anime wants to stand as truly top-tier, this character development for Akane -- defeating her nervousness by going after Azumi with however much more fervor -- will prove invaluable not just to her person but to the relationship she shares with Azumi overall.\n\nHira is, indeed, a bit of a wildcard at the moment since he has yet to give his feelings (which I hope will in turn push Azumi). But, given what the ED shows for its visuals and how TgK is Akane and Azumi's story and nobody else's, I fully expect these small obstacles to only get them even closer together.

She just had to force herself into the picture and now *JUST* as he got that hand she's going to draw back even more now...     \n\nAt this point can we just call it and say this is two cour? I don't know if they can wrap it up in 6 episodes and it feel good anymore. They have been building this relationship *so* much and its not that I think this is going to cause it to end, I do think we're probably going to come to a break and put things on hold because of this... Even before she showed up to the book store she had doubts on if this was going to work out so its probably going to happen...   \n\nBut I swear that girl better back off :<     \n\n[Nothing better break this apart for long, if at all](http://imgur.com/a/n5Cbh)    \n\nIs all I'm saying :\\     \n\nEdit- Okay at the same time though we need to give Chinatsu some credit... She knows there's probably something going on between them already.... But she still wanted to tell Akane how she felt because she's her friend more than anything else. That takes a lot of guts. For as much as I don't like Chinatsu all that much, I think what she did was an amazing job for her. I don't think she meant to say it to cause any trouble, in fact I think she's trying to do the opposite. I think she's wanting to tell Akane as soon as possible just so that if anything does happen they are on the same page instead of hiding it and hurting each other later... So yeah, I don't like it, but I think its good that it happened."

Really, for a show that seems quiet and slow paced, the anticipation and expectation of something going wrong causes a lot of stress. I think it's not just the fact that these two are novice to dating and romantic relationships, but also because we have gotten used to stories like these end up going down terrible routes that eventually cause the couple to break up or even hate each other, all because of miscommunications and misunderstandings... \n\nAnd so, Chinatsu confesses. I leave it up to the show to play this one out; so far, it has dodged certain points where you would've expected a fuckup, just when things were going well between these two. If it ends up being a love triangle, I just hope it doesn't get dragged out for so long that it just becomes aggravating to follow the story.... \n\nOh, and nice foreshadowing with the mention of \"Kokoro\" novel at the cram school.... right at the moment where Chinatsu is talking to one of the teachers!!

Honestly though, when Chinatsu was walking home with Kotarou from the cram school and got really close to him when the car came driving by...I started to feel a little bad for her. She's super cute in her own right, and if Kotarou wasn't so focused on Akane he'd probably realize that Chinatsu is a pretty good match for him. Her outgoing personality and charisma would be great for breaking him out of his shell. Akane is great in her own right, but her personality is incompatible with Kotarou's...which is why they're completely unable to speak to each other. Eventually they'll figure it out, but Chinatsu likely would've been a better first girlfriend for him. Oh well, you live and you learn.\n\nBut then, the end made me more cynical about Chinatsu, because she 100% knows that Kotarou has feelings for Akane, and she's trying to block Akane off from him by telling her she's got a crush on Kotarou to try to get out in front of a potential relationship. Up until now she was kind of helping Kotarou out here and there, but now she's decided she wants him to herself. She's unaware of Akane's feelings, and I suppose that's at least partially Akane's fault.\n\nIt really comes down to how Akane handles this. I'd love her to just come straight out with it to Chinatsu, but that seems pretty unlikely. This has the potential to become a pretty messy love rectangle, but so far the show has avoided that and surprised at each turn."

When Chinatsu and Azumi were walking down the road, you can see Chinatsu take interest in him and the hint is that it shows a blurred reflection of the moon in the water afterwards. It's basically saying that she thinks she has a crush on him because moon in japanese is tsuki deriving from suki which is like. "

Chinatsu should clearly recognize that Azumi and Akane have a relationship that is more than friendly. Ffs, she knew he was looking for Akane when he asked to borrow her phone last episode. It's strange that Azumi and Chinatsu have such an easier time talking than our main pair. Perhaps its because being around each other makes them nervous.\n\nThis show is really too damn cute. The ost has also been really great. I love the relationship progression and the realistic characters. At this point, the only real downside is the horrendous use of CGI side characters."

Kotarou finds it less difficult to \"communicate\" with Chinatsu because, unlike when he is with Akane, she doesn't cause his heart to pound away in his chest like no get out, making the butterflies in his stomach to go wild. To put it plainly, he has zero romantic feelings for Chinatsu."
