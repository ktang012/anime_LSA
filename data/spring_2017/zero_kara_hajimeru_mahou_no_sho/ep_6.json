Hope he realizes by next episode that it's better to be the servant of someone you can trust than be hired or \"played\" by someone with an erratic moral compass. He was lucky this time with the Tavern Girl, it could have been a heck worse.\n\nI still like Bartender girl, she needed a \"bouncer\", but she thought it was better to play with Merc instead of talking and agreeing in some kind of contract (can't blame her though, she's had some bad history with kemonos). And of course it didn't help that Merc was in a state where he's not sure what he wants at the moment.\n\nChanging subjects, it's a nice although a bit cliche touch that Merc wants to open a bar once he becomes human. Does this reminds anyone of a merchant that opens a bathouse along with his traveling partner?\n\n\nHah, and I was this close to droping the series because of the boring introduction/exposition from 13 in the last episode.

After all, his use as a bodyguard is his great Beastfallen strength.
