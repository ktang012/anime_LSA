I loved her typical childish response, she didn't understand the depth of his sentiment and just took it to mean don't use powers. I also love how the authorities (seen through police-dude) are being reasonable about this, they keep an eye on things but they're giving everything a fair chance and that helps keep the focus on the growth of the characters as it should.\n\nI hope the series balances bits like this with the ongoing plot; while I loved this episode to bits I want to see the twins also get outside and Sana get to show them what she now understands all about the world."

I'm glad I watched the special last week, it gave me a good mental image of Ootsuka Akio, and now every time Zouroko speaks a line I can picture his Akio's face in my mind.\n\nSo, in the first episode we got Zouroku driving a classic 70s mini, and in this one his employees are driving a classic VW bus (last time I checked a mint condition bus like that was worth a small fourtune) I guess the director of the series likes really old school cars.\n\nI could get used to this new vibe the show is going for (but we all know this will change within time)"

What is the point of the hugely dark intro arc, only to turn it into a moe slice of life show with unnecessary loli bath scenes, and groping by the older sister character?\n\nDon't trick me into thinking the show is going to be about more than generic moe slice of life and then rip that plot thread away halfway through. It's just whiplash for your viewers' expectations. Maybe we'll get back to that once they introduce the two new girls, but this just felt like a filler episode.\n\nJust like with Akashic Records I have huge qualms about the lack of any psychological trauma after a hugely tragic event, in this case, Sana getting shot in the back of a car, after being held down by force and peeing herself. Apparently none of that mattered. No nightmares or anything. Tra la la, life goes on, nothing to see here. She's a little girl. She would be recovering from that for a WHILE, if not her entire life.\n\nThe one part I did enjoy was when Sana tripped and fell because of her ridiculously stupid anime hair."

Do you have to be human to be afraid for your life after getting taken somewhere against your will and shot by a gun? Dogs have emotional trauma from being beaten and injured by their owners. \n\nMy guess is that the creators' explanation for this would be that Alice rewrote her entire being at the end of the scene when she transformed herself into the hospital gown and healed herself. I just think that's poor writing."
