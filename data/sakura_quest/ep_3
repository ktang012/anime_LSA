   "text": "Sandal is a really interesting character that I'm glad is used for much more than a one-off comedic relief. I always wondered why they credit him in the opening credits as the original creator for the show (Alexandre S.D. Celibidache is his real name as per episode 5), and now I'm thinking that maybe from a very loose meta narrative, it's meant to be as if this is his retelling of the lovely area of Manoyama (to get people to visit, perhaps). \n\nAlso thought it a bit of a jump to have Riri sing in front of people so quickly, but it was very nice and emotional. I hope Chitose loosens up a bit because of this, her character seems to swing from being lukewarm to downright mean. "

But then I remembered Riri volunteered to step in for the missing actress a few episodes back.  \n \nSinging in front of a dozen people is probably a step down from acting in front of a camera, crew and professional actors.\n\nShe's painfully aware of her social anxiety and knows she has to venture outside her comfort zone to improve. I really admire and envy her strength and fearlessness to push through."

   "text": ">One eighth\n\n>Guild\n\n[that voice](#hnng)\n\nThat over with, this was another brilliant episode. I'm going to link back to my comment last week since a lot of what I said there holds true here too: https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/comments/6fucmh/spoilers_sakura_quest_episode_10_discussion/dil5wa0/\n\nWhen that guy just starts talking over Riri the moment she shows up, tells her she's 'ruining the mood' and says she's not 'normal'. Ohhh boy I know that feeling. You're shy to speak up at all, and when you try and someone else just starts speaking over you it's crushing; it feels like you don't have a voice. If it happens once or twice it's not so bad. But when it's been happening regularly, for years, it really starts to cut deep. Death by a thousand papercuts.\n\nThat whole story with the dragon is beautiful! But wow that ending to it was unexpectedly dark. Not only did the dragon die alone, but it was demonised and the truth forgotten. Until Sandal-san and Riri bring it back!\n\n>How can you smile like that? I can't do that. I can't be like you... Nobody accepts me. Nobody understands.\n\n[](#comfortfood)\n\nOf course she feels like this. Not just the anxiety, shyness and introversion, not just the constant negative reinforcement from people around her, but the feeling of abandonment by her parents too. Ditched by them in a town neither of them wanted to stay in, stuck with her overbearing grandmother, with no control over her life. Not a healthy situation. Frankly she needs therapy; but then imo everyone needs therapy at least every once in a while.\n\nYoshino's being great this episode. She's made some hiccups in the past, but she gets the MVP award this episode. Positive reinforcement is exactly what someone like Riri needs. 'You are valid, your differences are not weaknesses, you are not wrong, I respect you and care about you.'. I'm also glad they didn't go overboard on the crying; no tear-jerking soundtrack, no generic melodrama, no wailing or shouting. Like everything in this show it was kept quiet, realistic and understated. And it's the first step in her becoming more comfortable in herself, exactly as I expected last week. Sometimes we all need a shoulder to cry on.\n\nAlso Sandal-san you beautiful bastard. Seriously his timing has been god-tier several times, but this is the first time it hasn't been to set up a joke. He's not a one-note character, he's not a generic goofy wierdo comedy relief cutout, he's a character too. And a good guy, at that.\n\nAnd that song. She's got a lovely voice and should share it!\n\nIt's spooky, Riri's situation these past two episodes has been unsettling close to my own, and music was a way I learnt to deal with my anxiety too. \n\nI'm not sure if it's that when performing I was in control, or that since I knew exactly what was going to happen and when I felt more grounded. Maybe it's that by controlling my breathing to sing and play instruments, I kept my breathing slow and calm rather than starting to hyperventilate. I spent ages on music when I was growing up, learned four instruments, sang in every music group I could find. A lot of seemingly confident people I knew struggled with nerves and stage fright, but in spite of my own anxiety I didn't. I played lead parts in musicals even though I was basically mute in a classroom. I performed to some 900+ people for school events without batting an eye, as part of small groups as well as solo. And I sang in the Royal Albert Hall three times, and that seats 5700 people (and it was full, holy crap, that time I did feel very nervous lol, until I started to sing, and then I was fine). Strange that I can do that and feel great, yet still get nervous when there's more than ten people in a room. \n\nIt was like singing helped me to find my voice, back when it felt like I didn't have one at all.\n\nAnd I know it's small, but that moment at the end where Riri mumbles a half-joke about Manoyama being a town for elopers, and Yoshino hears and responds positively; that would actually be pretty big to her, hence Riri's surprised reaction. Counter to the \"no-one wants to hear what you have to say\" that's been reinforced so much, including earlier in this episode, she's proving that Ririko does indeed have a voice, and she is being heard, and listened to as well.\n\nIt wasn't exactly unpredictable based on last week, [but still...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsqmU3v0hVA)"

   "text": "Riri was the character I could mostly relate to, in terms of introversion, shyness, and anxiety. I cringed when the policeman talked over her and said, \"Normal girls don't like that kind of stuff.\" Comments like that are very damaging for someone trying to speak up and participate in conversations. And I agree that if it happens enough times over a long period would force a person to rescind from any form of interaction.\n\nBut it's great to have someone like Yoshino who will help you through your rut. We need validation of ourselves from people who truly understand us. Riri is self-conscious of how weird she seems, but Yoshino assures her that it's nothing to be ashamed of; it's what makes her unique. I cried at Yoshino and Riri's one-on-one because it's similar to the few moments I had with people that helped me through my rut. So sweet! \n\nRiri's singing made me cry lol. There's something about having the stage to yourself that gives you empowerment, especially when you're used to being in the background. I could imagine Riri feeling less nervous and more courageous to sing the song because she's given the platform to speak and everyone is listening to what she has to say. It's a wonderful feeling (as someone who has social anxiety but found voice through theatre and dance)."

   "text": "That was a wrap-up for Ririko's mini arc. Now every major character has got one - Yoshino (1-3 ep), Sanae (4-5), Maki (6-7), Shiori (8-9) and Ririko (10-11). All of them were pretty formulaic and simple, but were handled in a nice, careful manner with humour and decent attention to details and characterization. Just as the show itself - it doesn't blows me away, but it's a by all means a pleasant watch. \n\nCurious what path the second cour takes. Will it continue to develop characters in the same arc-ish style? Or maybe there will be a single (or two) major arc which is going to comprise everything? I guess we'll see, though I expect a little bit of a step up for the second half, especially in terms of emotional investment. \n\nThe episode itself was straightforward just as analogy between dragon's story and Ririko. Good thing she didn't change much but still reflected a bit on her desicions and people around her. Also Chitose's overprotective and grumpy nature is explained, which is also nice. It's simple, but does this show need more than that? Will see what second cour has to offer. "

The act of a random jerk shutting you up when you're truly opening yourself (and isn't easy for you) because you seem boring to his eyes or you might ruin his day is something I don't desire to happen to anyone introvert and shy. It really makes you think you are trash and inferior to your peers, unworthy to live in community. It hurt so much seeing Riri there. Gladly Yoshino understood and showed interest as a way of making her feel better (besides of caring about her).\n\nWe've getting more and more Sandal-san moments, and he knows how to save the day (although it seems he limits himself being at the right place at the right moment)! Will he maybe get his own arc in a near future? Since he's an observer and the narrator it's unlikely, but it would be a nice surprise!\n\nAnd, relating to this week's name:\n\n**Ep 11: The Forgotten Requiem**: *requiem* means *rest* in Latin, and it's how musical pieces dedicated to the deceased are named, mainly as a mourning or as a wish for them to have a calm journey to afterlife. So, this week's name refers to the song Riri found out and sung to the visitors as a cultural experience. It is very appropriate IMO, because it complements and continues last episode's topic and plot, and also refers to Riri, as the song \"soothes\" her issues and keeps on with the simile of her being the dragon girl."

He just helped out Riri so effortlessly by little words about his own life story in Manoyama. \n\nAlso Riri singing the song accompanied by Sandal's guitar playing was pretty beautiful. \n\nI'd say, that's the best episode so far in terms of emotional impact...by far. And i hope it continues with this direction, more emotion please."

Even a bit back, seeing her [get upset](http://i.imgur.com/3SJCF1K.png) after pretty much indirectly told \"stfu no one cares\" made me want to punch the guy and hug Ririko.\n\nVery excited to get some back-story on Sandal-san too! I thought he may be that one weird character who talks nonsense the entire series remaining mysterious, but apparently not! As weird as he still may be, he's a truly interesting character and I love how he pretty much sang the song for Ririko [telling her not to cry.](http://i.imgur.com/BFTqDZ5.png)\n\nAnd in the end, the scene with Ririko singing was by far my favorite of the entire series up until now. I feel it kind of reflects how it is easier to come in front of a crowd or hang around people when it involves something you are passionate about. "

Ririko didn't have to go far to find that alternate dragon story; it was in a library in town.

Who do you guys think represent which creature?\n\nRiri is obviously the dragon. Which leaves a Phoenix, Unicorn, Pegasus, and a Griffin. I think Yoshino is the Phoenix because it rises from the ashes and they are all trying to resurrect the town, but she is the main force behind this. Shiori is probably the unicorn simply because its associated with friendship and happiness and Shiori seems to be the friendliest of the bunch. Pegasus was known for wisdom and Sanae oftens provides that. Maki is the Griffin due to process of elimination.\n\n"

While she initially wanted to run from her duties in Manoyama, when confronted with the reality of her contract, she stood her ground and has given her all."

   "text": "Wow what a nice way to end the episode. I'm really glad Riri got fleshed out as a character. I don't think her anxieties will ever go away, nor should we expect it to, but hopefully she'll become more comfortable with her eccentricities, and more importantly hopefully the other towns people will too. \n\nSpeaking of which, even though we got some of the backstory for Riri's grandmother, she still really rubs me the wrong way. She's been continuously rude to Yoshino, especially this episode when Yoshino just wanted to check up on her friend. And by this point Yoshino's shown that she's dedicated to the town and is not likely to run away anytime soon, and while not all her ideas are good she and her group has managed to bring some life back into the town. \n\nSeeing that one guy wash his hand in the drinking water hit a little too close to home.

   "text": "The instant Ririko was researching the dragons I found out the resemblance, and mostly also because I am an introvert as well. Ririko doesn't dislike human, but is just easily overwhelmed by interactions. This begins an idea of self doubt, wondering why is she the weird one out. She doesn't want extra attention, but because of so, she gathers odd looking eyes, and she also wants to try to interact with people normally like Yoshino does. However, every type of people have their own troubles. Yoshino is often hesitant with multiple opinions from different angles and can't make a decision, but Ririko stays true to herself. One part being Yoshino definitely wanted to stay in Tokyo, but was easily pulled into this whole campaign when she was given the chance to leave early in the series. Ririko really did her best to stand in front of the crowd. As an introvert, I always shake uncontrollably in front of crowds, or even just on stage with only a small group of people, even with multiple practices as I used to perform music. I want to give Ririko a big hug and tell her she's just fine the way she is, and I'm weird just as she is.\n\n\nOne thing I'm concerned is the dragon's song sounds so modern when it was supposed to be past on for an extremely long time, but whatever."
