So if the data suggests that sales of the early volumes of a LN/manga increases more strongly than the volumes where the adaption leaves off, then I'm probably wrong.\n\nThinking back on it now it is probably more likely that the people funding the anime find the ROI for later seasons doesn't justify creating them instead of deliberately not ending them. I'm kinda curious on how LN sales were affected by the three seasons of shakugan no Shana, because this is the only series, I know of, that received a third season to finish the series."

   "text": "The idea that great artists work on inspiration and passion is the big lie we tell ourselves about art. It's a romantic story but it's not true.  Artists who wait for the right inspiration are the ones who are bland, repetitive, and mediocre, because they aren't consistent enough to do good work, and they're not prolific enough to find the best creative ideas. Creativity (and by \"creativity\" I'm talking about finding new and interesting ideas) tends to come with experience, and experience comes from working a lot over a long period of time on challenging products. Experience does not come from waiting for inspiration.\n\nThis has been studied time and time again. Malcolm Gladwell talks about the 10,000 hours you need to spend in order to achieve mastery in a field. Obviously 10,000 hours is not enough, there are other things you need too, but the 10,000 hours is necessary.  You don't get that if you rely only on inspiration and passion, because inspiration and passion come and go.  You need a work ethic that stays with you week after week. Either you need the self-discipline to keep that up or you need pressure from the outside.\n\nDo some historical research into the daily lives of famous artists and you'll find a shocking number of them were workaholics, and the ones that weren't talk about how important it is to work every day, whether or not they feel inspired.\n\nEriri would not get better if she took her sweet time to do art.\n\nPersonally, I've done my best creative work under external pressure, and many of the people I know who do anything creative say the same thing."

However, it's not the same as having someone insult you and doing it because your pride is hurt. Self-discipline and a strong will to improve oneself comes from the greatest of passions and love for the craft itself. It's because one has such great passion that he/she will find a way to keep up his/her quality.\n\nIMO, consistency is not pressure, and artists need to be consistent, but not be pressurized all the time (i.e. a writer works for 6 hours every day, not 100 hours a week)."

   "text": "That's the lie\u2014people think that as long as you have passion, it's enough. People think that somehow self-discipline comes from passion. It's simply not true. Self-discipline is something else entirely, it's something that keeps you going even when your passion is gone, because passion is only a feeling, and you're human, you can't just continue to feel the same feeling forever. Our bodies and minds aren't set up to make us passionate long enough to be successful artists.\n\nThe ones that succeed have something else that's not passion, they have discipline and a work ethic. Eriri had stopped drawing because the passion was gone, and Tomoya accepted her excuses. In order to grow as an artist, she needs to develop the discipline to keep drawing even when the passion is gone, and Tomoya isn't helping her, he's enabling her to continue to make excuses. Akane isn't accepting Eriri's excuses, and will demand that she works, which is what Eriri needs.\n\nBecause you're not born with self-discipline, you have to develop it.\n\nThis makes some people uncomfortable, the idea that artists are often better off with a little bit of pressure. Pressure doesn't mean 100 hours a week. It means that you can't just throw away your work and start over because you don't like it. It means that you can't take the day off because you're not inspired. Pressure means that you have to develop the discipline to keep creating, consistently, to keep working and keep improving.\n\nNot everyone needs pressure, but lots of people do."

   "text": "People throw out the Malcom Gladwell 10000 hour quote a lot but that's highly simplified.  Most importantly, just putting in the hours by going through the motions isn't sufficient because not all hours are equivalent.  I've seen people sink a thousand hours into a game, only to be surpassed by people who've put in a tenth as much time simply because the latter were that much more effective with their time.  Also, not all fields are equal and some require far, far more training and effort than others.\n\nStill, the point does stand that you need to put in the time and effort.\n\nWhat someone considers their best work might not be the same as what others consider their best work.  From what I've observed at least, people tend to overvalue what they've done under pressure.  The logo and T-shirt design that took three weeks of constant work with to get just right with a strict deadline and external forces breathing down their necks... outsold by and not regarded as highly as the ones thrown together on a whim (and I've been on both sides of this).  I think people want all their effort and sacrifice to mean something so they put more value into it than an external observer would.  Of course, what's more important are the years of training that go into developing the skills needed to make either of them."

It's not a perfect rule for sure, but that's pop psychology for you.\n\nI've also seen the same thing you're talking about happen with games all the time. Most of the games I've finished I've put in maybe 40 to 150 hours, and all of them I finished with some kind of external pressure to finish quickly. I've literally not finished a game without time pressure in the last five years, and that's certainly with over a thousand hours put in. It seems pretty common among people I know, too, that without a deadline you just end up trying to do everything and in the end you don't finish the game. What a waste of time.\n\nThat's a good point that what people consider their best work is not what others consider their best work. Artists are generally not that great at figuring out what their best stuff is. It makes sense--if you're a musician, it's hard to listen to a song you write without hearing the perfect version of it in your head. And if art is a form of communication, criticism is a form of dialogue."

An example would be pro gaming, the needed amount of skill required to be useful as a pro keeps getting higher since everyone gets more experience with the game. \n\nLike Eriri's frustration is not only because she was in a slump, but also that Akane which she doesn't care much for was able to get her out of the slump while Tomoya who she cares for a lot wasn't. One could argue that it wasn't Tomoya's job to get her out of the slump, but Akane did anyway and the results speak for themselves.\n\nA lot of creators need motivation to work, for better or worse. E.g. another anime about creators this season is Eromanga sensei. Yamada elf talks about requiring burning motivation to work properly, while Masamune is all about having to work regardless of motivation. Both types exist and both types have succeeded."

Then Eriri has a confrontation with Kato and Kato is fucking pissed at Eriri for hurting Tomoya. Like Kato was seriously pissed and I hope it gets animated. This doesn't end well and the two are no longer friends Then it should be a scene with Tomoya meeting with the other 2 girls in a train station as they depart to work for Akane. Utaha then steals Aki's first kiss and takes away his glasses. Tomoya then comes to terms somewhat with their betrayal as they leave. ( this scene is rly important as them leaving is metaphorical for them leaving the Tomoya-bowl and the loss of his glasses symbolises Tomoya to turn into a more traditional MC) It seems they skipped these moments for going into volume 8 which Tomoya and Katou date for \"game research\" and they hold hands and start calling each other by first name. I dont know how they will deal with Izumi and Irori yet tho.\")"

They finally acknowledged each other's creations, so that's awesome! Also, we now know that Aki is really upset, but still wishes them the best nonetheless, so he gets some good points for taking it well, and he has **bestwaifuKatou** to help him out.\n\nSo, now I do have a good theory as to why Eriri wasn't motivated by Aki anymore and now by Akane: if you recall, Aki *did* insult her art before, which was shown as he was talking to her about how he didn't praise her artwork, merely calling it \"good\" insted of \"great\", which made Eriri try harder. After he softened up, she stopped trying as hard, and had to use that moment to keep herself motivated during the Winter Comiket fiasco.\n\nSo...basically, she's a masochist when it comes to her artwork: insults work better than praises, and because Aki can't bring himself to do that to his friend (and in reality, who would, unless you're just an ass), she couldn't do as well as she could. I really do wonder how she would react if she ever found out that she's a total M.\n\nAs for Utaha [Spoilers for the Future] (/s \"Basically, she's no M like Eriri, and even breaks down when Akane insults her in the same way she does Eriri, except the latter can take the critiques while Utaha ends up suffering and having her near unbreakable confidence shattered, so there's some retribution for the ex Utaha supporters that were betrayed by their queen. As for Eriri, Katou, Your Goddess, will handle that for you...\")\n\nStill, I can't wait to see how they'll end this season. Maybe we may get a season 3 greenlight at the end credits!

It seems that she didn't pluck up the courage to talk to Tomoya afterwards, which interestingly echoes how Tomoya left Kato out in the final days of their game.\n\nI'm looking forward to how Aki develops as a character after this hurdle, if he goes on a warpath at all, and if Saekano's going to be produced. Chances are, Izumi might end up in his circle instead."

   "text": "Damn I wish this season was longer, I cannot fathom them coming to a good conclusion with one episode left. I see people defending Eriri and Utaha, and I guess I can understand it from a professional standpoint, but I will be beyond disappointed if they somehow stay friends with Tomoya. Maybe rivals could work, but there is no way I will rate this show well if they do an asspull and reverse the betrayal in the next episode.\n\nEDIT: So I read the source material summaries past where the anime takes place, and [Major SaeKano LNs 9-12 Spoilers](/s \"I can already tell I am not going to like this. Too much white knighting from the MC to the betrayers... He sacrifices his own work to help them out of their own grave, even though they sacrificed their relations with him to dig their own grave. No idea what LN 13 will be like when it comes out, but I got a feeling it will not end how I want it to. In fact, I bet Eriri and Utaha join back with Tomoya after he saves their asses and they go back to merry days (without the harem hijinks since Kato wins in LN 12). I did however enjoy the fact that Utaha greatly regrets her decisions and builds off of them, not sure how much Eriri really changes aside from learning how to draw when Tomoya is around instead of having emotional artist block or whatever. The fact that Utaha tries to rape(? according to the summary I read) the MC in LN 12 tells me that she clearly did not learn how hard she lost the harem battle, or blindly thought she even stood a chance after how weak she looked during LN 10-12.\") This is just my opinion from what I read, however. In the end, it is only a story and I probably got too worked up over it."

As far as I care they can take them out of the story now, which is MUCH better for me, because fuck both.\n\nNo seriously, they made their exit now, whatever happens to them now is not important for the story.

However, there seems to be a split on whether their action of not informing Aki of their decision is justified. Some say they don't owe him anything while others say that it's betrayal.\n\nHere's my take. Utaha and Eriri are shitty friends. They left Aki when they decided that they have no more use for him (Utaha basically being rejected and Eriri becoming Aki's number one). Saying that both of them don't owe him any explanation is bullshit since being noticed by Akane was a result of Aki dragging them both into creating a game. And it's not like they didn't benefit from it since they both learned something new because of that project (Utaha learning that too much description isn't good in a visual novel and Eriri achieving a new art style). Now that they want something new (Utaha wanting to f*ck Eriri's art and Eriri realizing she has masochistic tendencies XD), they couldn't even be bothered to say to Aki that they're leaving the team, for a WHOLE MONTH! Heck, if Tomoya didn't chase after Utaha, they probably wouldn't say anything at all. Doesn't Aki deserve that at least? They're still technically friends, right?\n\nConclusion: Utaha and Eriri are opportunistic b*tches, Kato is best girl, Michiru is forgotten XD"

Same thing could be said for Utaha, if her writing was really not on par with Eriri's art and up to the caliber of the RPG project (think Final Fantasy), why through the official channel contact Utaha's publisher in the first place?  Note that a commercial contract with Utaha would mean some profit sharing with her publisher as well, so that's a pretty important business collaboration between companies, not some decision to be taken lightly.

And then they have the nerve to blame him just because both of them need someone who bullies them to be motivated! My God! This makes me so mad! I won't share any tear for them! At least Katou saved this episode for me."

He'll just end up with Kato. It was good for Utaha and Eriri to move on and find something that would benefit THEM and not living for Aki like they were before. It shows they both have grown. \n\nAnd they don't owe Aki anything, as he's just making up projects as he goes and there was never any talk of a new game.

It's only natural for someone to keep pushing after some success, so the need to tell the girls that he was planning something isn't necessary, especially when he kept asking when Eriri could draw again, dropping hints that he hopes she'll be able to draw again so he can work on the next proposal. She even knew herself that he wanted to work on something new.\n\nSecond leaving the team to join a veteran and promised of fame and money is too good of an offer to pass no matter what, but honestly, that decision is hollow and one-sided. Aki is stripped of two of his creators and more importantly friendship. Even though he never really followed through with Utaha's vague confession, he didn't say no flat out. With Eriri, it started to look like their relationship was blossoming again, so the potential to move beyond friends and something more was there, we'll just never know. \n\nIn short I don't disagree with you, I completely agree that decision is the best for the girls. I just disapprove of the way they were poached (by being insulted) and the matter they handled of leaving Aki. If the Akane was stern but not an asshole and they told Aki let's say within a week of their decision then trust me, I would have nothing to say and probably defend the girls decisions"

I mean comparing Tomoya's small dream to working at a big hit title, Katou is just sticking around since she has no where else to go. As for Tomoya's future, I have no clue where hes going. Definitely pursuing his dream, but it was never clarified how. I also thought Iori and Izumi were going to join Tomoya on his project. (If its happens, I would love to watch a side story about this). Michiru been missing in action for awhile. (Everyone forgot about her LOL. Maybe another side story on her?) Honestly, I would definitely watch a show just to see Eriri and Utaha working at the big hit title, like another Shirobako-type show but with Saekano's characters. So things gonna wrap up soon, but seems like there are some more potential material that's left over."

There's rarely a time when a team stays together for a long time (CLAMP may be an exception). Freelance is the way of the creative world and it's only natural that they all go out on their own at some point."
