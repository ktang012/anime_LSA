It was so refreshing to see all the ''party'' so chill and in control, no panic at all, not over-reaction ''see, a monster, lets get shit done'' not just standing around and getting fuck for no reason, everyone of them is a trope, yes, but all of them are toned down so much that the result is much more natural. Also finally getting some personality from Gran, it seems he was a loner as a child and still adjusting to be in a team (Also we discovered that Gran is a fucking NBA player). Literally the most under-rated fantasy anime of the season is becoming the best example on how to do ''classic JRPG'' show well. Glad that both  Shingeki no bahamut and GranBlue anime adaptations (both games from Cygames) are getting good direction."
