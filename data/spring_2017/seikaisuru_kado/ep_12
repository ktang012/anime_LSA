It felt like a big-budget Hollywood SciFi movie with the orchestral soundtrack, military involvement and scientific aspect, but was actually more interesting than most of those I've seen! I was on the edge of my seat for the entirety of the episode as they were slowly researching the cube. I loved how they used actual realistic methods that totally felt scientifically accurate and logical course of action. Stuff like checking for Doppler or IR and targeting the wall's corner were interesting and felt realistic. The CG didn't even look that bad and the directing of the series felt very spielberg-ish and kept me interested throughout. This was one of the most interesting pilots I've seen over the past few series and I was thrilled throughout. I absolutely can't wait to see how this continues, but so far I'm absolutely amazed and intrigued."

If she was the official head of the team it's completely different but for all intents and purposes she acts as a consultant so it makes sense they would put up with her for the time being."

Music was quite nice, too, so curious to listen to more of the OST.\n\n[Kugimiya Rie's scientist](http://i.imgur.com/Ns6EVNP.jpg) reminded me a bit of her role in Punch Line. She seems like a fun character though I think [someone else ended up catching my interest](http://i.imgur.com/ANWAX7a.jpg). There isn't much info on most of the characters yet so I'm still just curious about everyone but I like Yahakui's design at least. Him and Shindou-kun seem to have made some arrangement probably, so looking forward to the next episode!\n\n"

Episode 0 on the other hand had some great character interactions, a good plot and introduced the world really well. I would of preferred a show continuing episode 0 rather than the switch to the supernatural in all fairness.\n\nAnd that includes the CGI, 0 was hand drawn until we reach the crossover between 0 and 1, now I will say this show is hands down the best implementation of CGI to characters in anime, yet by showing the same characters in CGI and 2D it becomes a showcase of the pitfalls of CGI.\n\nAnimation and movement is disjointed, expressions lack fluidity and emotion and the overall look creates a strange feeling where characters I took an interest in when hand drawn I found myself not as invested when they were CGI. There's a placebo affect of 2d characters that this style will always lose for me, I just can't get as invested in the world with it. (The opposite is also true where if you present me with fluid movements I find myself getting more easily invested in the world, even if the shows narrative hasn't completely grabbed me).\n\nWas it good? I'd say so, probably my least favourite show so far but I haven't managed to catch much so far so that isn't really all that damning of a statement."

Overall though, more things I like about it than dislike right now, so might as well keep it going and see."

(Seriously Toei, please don't do that.)\n\nThe premise was neat, and I like how they showed everyone approaching it in a logical manner.

The ending is haunting since there was no indication that it wasn't a slice of life show about a skilled government negotiator.\n\nWatching the characters have a small, unrelated personal success really lets you know them as people and makes the scifi stuff more compelling since the MCs feel like real, normal people. \n\n*Edit: After watching episode 1 I can definitely say this show is very captivating. How grounded the story is makes it very compelling. For that reason I find the \"scientist girl\" character very distracting. She's an anime character in the real world. \n\nFirst contact is always a really compelling story idea and I very much enjoyed the two Star Trek:TNG episodes on the subject. Watching a story about a struggle to communicate and understand one another is very captivating to me and stands apart from all the childish attempts at similar stories where things go the way they do because the plot demands it. \n\nGreat show, I highly highly recommend it.
