Take this episode, Mamika doing that in a random city away from all the other creations would cause more mayhem than actively fighting creations and people that annoy her. Unless she as a character is a showboating type, then she has no reason to play a game such as the current war or she has another goal to achieve. Even if she succeeded in her goal, it would have been needlessly obstructed.\n\nIt just doesn't fit the character well to be doing these summons intentionally. It seems like it's luck of the draw deal more than anything else as of now, or she made some really bad choices for causing chaos."

Understanding her depiction would allow everyone else to understand her character motivations, which would allow for any number of new options - negotiations, prediction, and potentially weakspots as well.\n\nBut no.  Souta has to keep it all to himself, because apparently anxiety makes you a dick.  It doesn't.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned, this isn't about anxiety and stress - unless the writers come up with a surprising twist as to Souta's real motivations for keeping quiet, it's a plot device that advances the plot rather than advancing Souta's personality.\n\nI've covered this elsewhere, but there is a personality flaw or a mental disorder has to be a flaw that motivates characters reasonably.  An example of this would be Adam from Paradise Lost - Milton spent thousands of lines explaining how much Adam loves Eve before finally having Adam commit the ultimate crime of betraying God when Eve implores him to eat the fruit with her.  Adam's reasoning at that moment is perfectly lucid - he realizes that Eve has fallen, he realizes the depth of what is at stake when she asks him to eat, and he realizes too that should he continue to obey God he would lose Eve.  This character flaw of Adam's presents him a dilemma which we as a reader would all struggle with - there simply isn't a perfect solution to the problem which would allow Adam to have all of what he wants.  That's a good use of a well-established character flaw which is also (incidentally) quite understandable to everyone who has ever fallen in love.\n\nA bad character flaw, or mental weakness, is one which does not do any of the above; a mental flaw as a plot device is a rather blunt way to move the plot forward at the expense of your character development.  Souta's \"flaw\", as far as I can see, falls neatly into both categories.  His unwillingness to talk about Altair was not sufficiently explained - which, for a show full of exposition, is rather amazing - and the end result is that the audience is left scratching their heads at his sudden newfound stubbornness and stoicism as far as regards his knowledge of Altair.  Even if his unwillingness were fully explained, he would still not be in a dilemma - because there is an obvious \"perfect solution\", in that all he has to do is speak up.  Writers who set up mental flaws can't just expect the flaw to act as an all-purpose block that prevents a character from doing something at all and any costs - a flaw or a fear has its breaking point in real life, i.e. even an arachnophobic person would run through a spiderweb to escape a burning building or a crazed gunman.  Effectively, the writers of Re: Creators are saying Souta would rather fight a crazy gunman than run through a spiderweb.  Which would be fine if this were a comedy, but they seem to be actually taking themselves seriously.  The third problem, which is actually an extension of the second, is that there is really no benefit for Souta's remaining silent other than for the plot to continue leading us into some sort of poorly-written dramatic irony where we know very slightly more than some characters do.  This makes sense from a plot-perspective, as it allows for more maneuverability from other characters as they gain new (and different) hints towards the truth and act based on those hints in different but logical ways that presumably will set up more conflict, but at the same time the fundamental problem is still not resolved, in that Souta as a person has no reason to keep silent.\n\nI could write a whole thesis on character motivations, but essentially:\n\n> its not like you can just go up to someone, anyone, and just say \"Hey, I know who this person is, they are a character which was created by my friend who I forced to commit suicide\"\n\nYes, you can if enough is at stake.  And for Souta's scenario, way more than enough is at stake, to the point that I'd suspect that there's got to be a better reason than a dead friend that's keeping him silent.  If his dead friend is really the only thing that's keeping him silent, Souta would be (IMO) a really poorly written character with thoroughly head-scratching and unsympathetic motivations."

   "text": "I think you've fundamentally missed the point I was making - which was clear as day to me, but evidently some people communicate rather differently.  I'll try again.\n\nIt's all fine and dandy to have emotional characters - in fact, unemotional characters such as Rei Ayanami or the Rei clone in this show generally tend to be bad characters - but if your character's actions cannot be explained from a reasonable perspective, it's a bad character.\n\nA good character, driven by emotions, will still make decisions which can be understood from a rational standpoint to a worldwide audience.  For instance, let's go with another classic - let's try this theory of Hamlet.  Hamlet's decision to feign madness was criticized by Samuel Johnson and Voltaire because fundamentally, there was no reason that he had to feign madness other than because he wished to.  Now, we might laugh at his antics, and it certainly gave Shakespeare room to stuff in many jokes at the expense of Polonius, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, and even Claudius - but as Johnson rightly points out, an audience looking for an understandable character whose decisions we can understand, will be left scratching their heads at the play.  On the other hand, the scene in which Hamlet abandons his pretense of madness to declare his grief at Ophelia's grave is also similarly irrational.  His coming out of hiding would only ruin his elaborate escape from Claudius and also ruin his best chance of avenging his father and killing Claudius - but as an audience, we can understand that he has been too struck by grief, and also enjoy the dramatic irony in the background - from Hamlet's perspective of a payoff matrix, in which he doesn't know that Laertes blames him for the death of Ophelia, revealing himself in public as a fellow mourner for Ophelia's death should have returned him to good standing in the eyes of others, and potentially allow him to make other actions later to confront Claudius.  This is why his stepping out of hiding is such an effective scene emotionally compared to his scenes of madness - because we as an audience understand why he MUST step out, even as we internally scream to him he shouldn't, that he's misinformed, that he's being stupid.\n\nQuite simply, you don't get that in this show.\n\nSota's stoicism is the equivalent of Hamlet's madness.  There's no reason for why he does it.  In fact, it's even worse than Hamlet's madness - because feigning madness didn't actively harm Hamlet.  It only ever produced some cheap laughs for the audience, and from a payoff matrix perspective feigning madness was no worse off than not feigning madness.  For Souta, however, there is a clear and distinct cost to remaining silent.  And unlike Hamlet, there aren't even good jokes to tide us over the confusing period where the characters' motivations don't align with their actions.\n\nThe argument that Souta's motives are his emotions, which you maintain are there but which I just simply don't see, is a ridiculous proposition.  By that metric I could make any character do any action for any or no reason, because it's their emotion.  Why does John Doe waggle his arms up and down like a penguin before squawking like a chicken in front of the Australian Prime Minister?  Emotions, you won't get it.  Why does Jane Doe take her bike out to ride round and round in circles in the roundabout?  Emotions, you won't get it.  Why did Tom kill Harry with a frozen trollop at breakfast this morning?  Emotions, you won't get it.\n\nWell, damn right you don't get it - you don't get it because they're all incredibly poor characters with no discernible motives at all.  Just like Sota."

However, they keep throwing the same feeling of guilt over and over when the audience already knows how he feels.

So why he is not growing as a character and keeps doing the same thing since episode 1? Because they want to delay it until the last possible moment so something terrible happens.

It could totally be what you're saying especially with how Sota reacted when Megane confronted her, but I think that reaction can also very well fit with my theory.

If after knowing all of this she didn't go for Sota the first time she saw him, it must be that Sota didn't play a role in her death, didn't caused it... And thus in the first episode Altair doesn't bother with him at all and focuses on her plan to destroy everyone.\n\nThat's why I think that Sota just ignored glasses girl when she needed him the most, and then went and commited suicide."

I do feel like Setsuna felt betrayed by Souta in some way, otherwise Souta wouldn't feel as guilty and as defensive by not speaking directly about it.\n\nWhy I do favor Souta being part of the online mob though is because of the way this story is structured. 8/22 episodes in and we've already burned 4/5ths through the story's great mystery. There's a bunch of episodes left, and unless the story undertakes a fundamental shift in character dynamics, then I fear what we'll get is vapor. So far I trust that the creators of the show know what they're doing, that's why I expect the next \"arc\" to be about Souta's character development. And what better way to twist the story than to make him a bad boy of the show. Or for him to take agency in some other way, which he was avoiding this whole time."

Another reason I think that he just didn't was there for glasses girl is for how strange would be for him to ask what he asked to Meteora and how he reacted to her answer, besides, he has exhibited the behavior that once he sees someone that is much better than him at drawing or something, he would feel that he should not bother to get better and stop. I think he even mentions it once in an episode before. \n\nThat's why I think that Sota just didn't supported her when she needed it, and that he feels guilty because he feels that if he where there for her when she reached to him, she would be still living."

And instead of solving those questions, the writers offer a new theory (that material done by other authors won't create other versions of Selesia as long as they \"fit into the storyline of the original story\") which raises new ones:\n\n-Shouldn't that mean Selesia would remember \"untold stories\" fanfiction set during the events prior to that moment in the anime?\n\n-What about AU fanfiction that pulls complete twists on the characters? Aren't they different Selesias?\n\n-What if the anime changes the original storyline? Wouldn't she be a different Selesia too?"

For all the theorization we have seen, no one but Souta has brought up that point again. Matsubara's inability to change Selesia is left as it is, with no one even suggesting that he may not be this Selesia's creator, and in this latest episode we have Meteora stating how unlikely it would be that several versions of Selesia exist *even if they come from different authors*.\n\nIf I didn't suspect better, I'd say Meteora is gaslighting the characters XD"

It would be logical for her to die now though, as the episode has shown us that there's a possibility that other characters variations can actually exist, and I would perfectly believe if Altair would go for another Mamika to support her, which could put an interesting plot twist in the show, since it could mean that, MAYBE, the reason glasses girl commited suicide is thanks to a variation of a character of Altair that also has the ability to travel between worlds. This would open the plot enough to cover the 2 cours, with a new OP for the new cour with new creations joining the fray.. maybe.\n\nI must give it to Altair's VA, the way she delivers those lines are perfect.

I can't help but think that this MC character is very well made. \n\nListen calmly to me for a sec. \n\nImagine that Sota is Setsuna's creation and Setsuna had been reading this reddit and those comments regarding Sota those past few episodes. Even thought she had talent with drawings and she had put all her soul into creating this character. All of you are bashing/hating on her creation. \n\nThis along with the pressure/bullying she probably encountered at school and that drawing is the only joy she have left in this world. Now imagine adding to all this even her best friend turn on her. \n\nYou guys don't want to see Sota anymore just like how in the anime Altair is being wipe from existence by her haters in the internet or that video post board. Following the logic on that the creation need to have a lasting impression on the population(us) to be able to manifest, then this actually make sense. \n\nFor us creators, we not only put our souls but also our feeling into our creations. I wouldn't be surprise that Setsuna  created Altair with the mindset of wanting to destroy this cursed world with so much hater and given her ability to do so.\nAnd Altair having been manifest only to find that her creator is dead, and in a way kill by us. (Again you guys don't want to see the MC anymore, imagine the creator of MC had also commit suicide.)\n\nNow let's imagine Altair manifest because all those hate on Sota(MC).\n\nAltair's speech at the end - \"I hate you all, I hate your stories, everything in this world is vile, this world rejected my ally(MC), all she(MC) wanted was a place to belong, only a tiny humble wish. But the world(This reddit board) humiliated her(MC). They spat at her(MC) and laughed at her(MC), they treated her like she didn't(Shouldn't) exist. She(MC) was abandoned by this world. You don't know what you're talking about, You don't know what it feels like, you don't know what her(MC) sorrow feels like. Her wailing, her resentment...YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE, YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU HAVE NO IDEA!!!\"\n\nIf you think this way, I think the emotion created here is very strong and the MC completely served his purpose.\n"

   "text": "There is mental weakness, and then there's this.  This isn't weakness - it's a plot device.\n\nA weakness has to be well-reasoned and justified, not just from an emotional perspective, but also from a rational perspective.  Good weaknesses lead at the very most to skewed rational judgements, not completely irrational ones.  Weaknesses that lead to irrational actions for the sake of the plot are nothing but plot devices.\n\nAn example of a bad mental flaw would be \"this character is a clean freak.  Because he is a clean freak, when he sees a cola stain on his kitchen floor, he decides to burn the house down and emigrate to South America.\"  The actions just don't logically follow from the \"mental flaw\" because they're so exaggerated that they border on comical.\n\nA good mental flaw that I can think of off the top of my head would be Griffith from Berserk.  Griffith is established to be a calculator, a rational person, someone who,[Berserk Spoilers](/s \"when given a choice to offer all his men as a sacrifice for the power he needs to bring peace to Midland and become its ruler, does exactly that.\")  The mental flaw, his ambitious and callous personality, does not override his rationality - instead, his personality guides his actions towards a reasoned and rational conclusion which even an unsympathetic audience has to agree makes sense.  If a character flaw leads a character to do something that's fundamentally irrational, the audience isn't going to nod wisely and say, \"aha, that's understandable.\"  They're going to be sitting around scratching their heads and thinking, \"hand on a minute, this doesn't make any sense,\" and they'd be fully justified in pointing that out.\n\nSouta, for example, does not have a personality trait that leads him to make decisions even unsympathetic audience members have to agree makes sense.  Instead, the writers are using his purported mental weakness as a shield, or a crutch, to keep their other characters in suspense and so leave more room for misunderstanding and conflict in later episodes.  \"Why wouldn't he tell everyone what he knows?\"  \"Oh, umm.  You know.  It's because... it's, like, traumatic and all, and he doesn't want to tell.\"  \"You mean he's so traumatized that he'd much rather everyone fighting for the fate of the earth have faulty information than talk about it?\"  \"Yeah, moving on, look at this awesome explosion!\"\n\nIt's just lazy writing, as far as I can see.  I don't understand why people are comparing him to Shinji Ikari from Evangelion, at all - Shinji's mental weakness led him to make a fully justified conclusion that running away would probably allow him to live more comfortably and more safely than fighting angels.  It's a selfish but reasonable decision that anyone could make if they're so inclined.  Souta's reason for keeping silent?  Well, there's no rational aspect to it.  It's just \"look man, he's mentally weak, so even though there's every reason for him to share what he knows and it doesn't cost him anything to do so, he'll keep quiet.\"  Yeah.  That's not mental weakness at all, or if it is it's portrayed very bizarrely.  It's just called bad writing."

He doesn't even have to mention his friend or his own involvement or anything, and that'd be enough to save the world.\n\nFrankly, if the only reason he's keeping his mouth shut is because of some ridiculous guilt complex, it's not a convincing reason.  His keeping his trap shut would feel like nothing more than a plot device so that they could fill in a few more episodes with poorly-written dramatic irony.\n\nWhat I hope will happen, is that they're encouraging us to hate Souta because of an apparently ridiculous guilt complex, only to reveal that actually it was nothing to do with guilt at all and he's got a genuine reason to keep his trap shut - at which point we as the audience all go, \"damn, should've realised\", and feel more sorry for Souta after raging against him for the better half of a month.\n\nOr maybe it's really just a pretty obvious plot device.

   "text": "Wow, so much to \"talk\" about this episode.\n\n[](#gendo-pls)\n\nI kinda wished Sota would have contacted Selesia instead to spill out the beans, she would have kicked his ass until he confessed (he needs a wake up call along with a swift kick in the ass). But of course he's a freaking wuzz and [calls out Meteora](http://imgur.com/EBjnkHR.jpg) who would baby him. I don't blame him, entirely; that's totally within his character as a powerless narrator.\n\nI like the big contrast of Mirokuji compared to Selesia. Both are [bold characters](http://imgur.com/se8aVp7.jpg), but also know when to restrain themselves. But in this case, Mirokuji just couldn't handle himself. I can see a lot of the arrogance in both his creator and Mirokuji, but can see a huge difference when it comes to thinking about their peers where the creator looks just like some guy who doesn't care at all for the peeps around him.\n[Nice jab](http://imgur.com/5xyqwwE.jpg) thrown by Selesia's creator, btw.\n\nMoving on. This is the main reason why the show gets a lot of flak by impatient peeps. The cast is quite big and each character has their own backstory/world and their own personality that needs to be shown for us to form an idea about him her and decide wheter to root for him/her or not. Already stated that; I dig [Magane](http://imgur.com/q4zLN8i.jpg) a lot for being the [troublemaker](http://imgur.com/dMBCsXs.jpg) giving a hard time to the MCs and [our narrator](http://imgur.com/UGaB9xf.jpg) in this case, I always apreciatte a good antagonyst. Love her cynical and stalky, intimidating attitude. Very very nice way to show to our narrator how powerless he is at the moment and [how fucked](http://imgur.com/B7zulTm.jpg) up their world is by a simple cutscene of her shredding a bunch of flyers. Point taken & dully noted.\n\nMamika & Aliceteria's scene on the [rooftops](http://imgur.com/Ua2msf8.jpg) was very nice & warm. Some really nice bonding that has been shown in several episodes, but this one in particular comes off stronger by Mamika being the one to talk about the elephant in the room (and yeah yeah, hold your horses you Yuri fans). This particular cut shows how mature and how much she has grown since she arrived into this world of creators. She [aknowledges](http://imgur.com/VWjyYPw.jpg) her life in her world is a lot easier than Aliceteria's but both of them were put into their worlds for a bigger reason; to bring order and peace to it. I was so swept away by her speech that I completely ignored that huge deathflag.\n\nAnd finally some light has been shown on top of the [main antagonyst](http://imgur.com/RaP9Tpb.jpg) and her motivations for invading this world. And of course the 2nd character with the [highest sense of justice](http://imgur.com/gF9JRaE.jpg) is the one that pulls out [the move](http://imgur.com/seqhGqG.jpg). And just like most magical girls, poor [Mamika](http://imgur.com/xuh7F6T.jpg) wants to [save everyone](http://imgur.com/Yz4c3iT.jpg), including that who is now her [current foe](http://imgur.com/YOWnDmU.jpg).\n\nThis episode was purely Mamika with a sidedish of everyone else. And it was very needed to be shown in the exact way it was so we can understand Mamika's volition.\n\n"

I ended up thinking \"Hmm what is the way she would affect other characters the _most_?\" And yes, dying would be probably it.\n\nIt also makes sense given that [Meta Spoiler for Another Show](/s \"She seems to be based, personality wise, both on Madoka and Mami from Madoka Magica, and both ended up as tragic heroes, albeit in different ways.

If he told them about his past with Setsuna, will everyone accept him as for who he is or will they despise him? Will his feeling of being guilty be lifted or will it be added if he told them? If he is a real life person I believe that's what he had in mind and this had pressured him in a way or another. But at least he started to give some hints towards Meteora and would likely that hints will connect to the future episodes.\n\nHeck I rather watch Sota than last two episodes of AoT.

   "text": "The slapstick-ish scene with Mirokuji going to harm his Creator doesn't really fit in a story that has established that violence isn't just an abstraction of anything but is something real, and has real effects on people and infrastructure. Especially since we've had one Creator murdered by his creation and another kidnapped with currently-unknown fate. I can see Mirokuji acting that way but everyone else should take it more seriously, particularly the government. Even though he gives off a pathetic vibe, he was pulled from his work with a looming deadline into something he has no context for or preexisting interest in, and they hadn't even shown off any magic to prove they were more than a bunch of cosplayers.\n\nOther than that, pretty good episode. I interpreted Souta's actions as him trying to work up the courage to tell Meteora a little about Altair, but then he realised they found out without him and he didn't know how to proceed any more. There are still things he should tell them but he chickened out... and is now facing consequences for it. Magane ripping the paper as she talked was hard to take seriously though. At least we have context for seeing the threat she poses as real.\n\nWith how the show addressed fan creations, which people have been speculating about, it really feels like Re:Creators is dedicated to addressing every stray idea that its premise invites. I do find it interesting, but that's really not helping its too-much-exposition problem, and I doubt everything will be important.\n\nMamika's development is approximately what people predicted in previous threads. Not much to say about the execution. Most of the broad strokes are what you'd expect but things like Mamika getting stabbed before the battle even begins and not getting a proper battle scene was pretty great. I can respect her pursuit of her ideals even if she wasn't very smart about it, and it did make for a good moment. I don't really care for characters who want to punish the whole world because of one person's suffering since there's not much to say other than \"It sucks that that happened, but no,\" but Mamika really doesn't have the context to truly empathise with Altair. Her attempt at connecting and talking things out was always doomed to failure."

Now it's all \"Altair wants to destroy the world\"... which was conveniently foretold by Meteora in a theory based on sketchy concepts like forces that try to make things make sense, restorarion of power, coefficient of elasticity, etc. of which there was zero prior evidence. \n\nOr how here Meteora quickly assures Selesia that there won't be more versions of her character if other writers do fanfiction about her... the same Souta's remark that this Selesia could be the anime version was handwaved, despite it explaining why Matsubara can't change her and how come she doesn't know about the most recent events in the novels.\n\nThese are just some instances. In general, I'm afraid Re:Creators devotes too much exposition time for some aspects and too little for others. And the hand of the writers is too obvious."

They already explored a lot of those concepts in the first 5 episodes, and episode 6, 7, and 8 so far adds nothing new to those discussions. They are just wasting so much time repeating the same thing or the same motivations from the same character (which to be fair it still isn't very clear what half the characters wants ... for example red hair knight girl, why is she even in the show since she adds nothing important to the plot and her motivation is unclear, or the kid with the mecha, why is he even in the show? characters just drop from the sky out-of-nowhere and they don't even serve important purposes.)\n\nAnd whatever happened to testing \"how to make changes to your fictional character\"? They did that on episode 3, and Exposition-chan had a theory that maybe it needs a lot of audiences for changes to implement, but this is never tested, and then after that they just dropped that experiment entirely and it's never discussed again. Why exactly? I thought the point of gathering authors/artists was because they have power to change these fictional characters, so I guess for some reason that's not important anymore? And what exactly do these people want to accomplish anyway?\n\nThe plots are just so ambiguous and jumping all over the place it can get so painful to watch week after week. Some character gets a surprisingly a lot of development because she needs to get killed, while others are almost completely ignored for some unknown reasons, and it is still unclear what purpose half of the cast serve in the story besides putting most of them all in a big fight in half an episode."

   "text": "I definitely felt she was raising death flags left and right these last two episodes, but I didn't expect this to happen so quickly. Her facial expression as the first blade stabbed through from the back and that explosion at the end were both great. However, this feels the number of conflicting parties is decreasing too quickly considering the length of the show. If Mamika is out of the equation, we now only have two teams (maybe Alice will break off). The unbalanced nature of each character's power means that 1 v 1 fights are unlikely, so I would expect future fights to be like that of last episode's. If so, it's going to reach resolution very quickly.\n\nI am wondering would there be more characters being added in. Since now Mamika has exited team Altair, she will need to summon more characters to balance the power against team government along, not to mention her further plans for destruction. It will also be a natural shift for the story since Altair has been slowly stepping into the spotlight the past episode plus. We are probably three episodes away from a new set of OP/ED, which also makes the next few episodes seem like good timing. The only problem will be the fact that we already have a rather large cast.\n\nIf more characters aren't introduced and assuming the resolution of Altair's plan being this show finale without further plot twist (although I personally expect one coming), then the most effective way to \"stall\" time will be to delve more into the current characters' backgrounds. We saw a little bit of that this episode with Alice's past, and Bliz's past also seem potentially interesting.\n\nIt's also nice to see the show finally commenting on fan fictions, which we've been all wondering in these threads since the early episodes. \n\nPS: it's a little sad seeing how few comments this thread has. The first four episodes turned too many people away, despite how well the show has been picking up since then."
