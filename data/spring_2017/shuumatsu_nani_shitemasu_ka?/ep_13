Next thing I knew, I had flown through the entire first volume and quickly placed an order for all of the remaining volumes. I'm enjoying it immensely.\n\nThis first episode covered chapters 1 and 2 of the first LN (excluding the prologue which was covered in the after credits scene). Volume 1 has 5 chapters all up excluding the prologue, so it's looking to be a very well-paced adaptation. Not entirely unexpected when you have [the author of the LN as the main writer for the anime.](http://i.imgur.com/7iyLpad.png)  \nAll-in-all, I can say I'm genuinely confident in this adaptation. It's already turning out well from the get-go.  \nKutori is as cute as I'd imagined, as are the lolis (Tiatto is my favourite). Naigrat (I have no idea how these names are supposed to be Romanised. I'm sorry Kareno Akira, I love your stories but you have zero naming sense.) was pretty much what I'd expected if not a little more seductive.\n\nI love it, and can't wait for next week. If there's anyone on the edge, keep watching. You won't be disappointed by this series. It's been my most anticipated show of the season by far and I'm sure I'm not alone in that."

Also, although it is sung by a japanese singer, the original is an old english folks song, the version by Simon&Garfunkel was really popular.\n\nNow, when is the last time you have heard a soft, soothing intro to a fantasy anime - without beats, guitars and so on? I feel like the power-type of opening that kinda exists to get you hyped is so overused in anime. This song however just sets up a calm, somewhat reverie-like aura and makes the opening sequence look like a magical (figuretively), unusually happy episode from this world, with the song telling about two lovers and the thinhs they want the other to at least try to accomplish, to show their love. (Something that about 95percent of the japanese might not understand due to lacking english skills)\n\nAll in all, this song felt like it was more chosen for artistic value and feels, not for making a grand hyping opening that makes everyone excited. And in comes the fact that I simply like that song :p "

I don't know what kind of ride I'm in for, but I have a feeling things will get dramatic and emotional later, with all the girls being referred to as \"weapons\" and all. The montage of Kutori (idc what the crunchyroll subs said, mal's spelling is easier) and Vilem exploring the city and getting lost was really fun, and that song was utterly beautiful. Then they got to the nursery, and this is what I really loved to see--[the four kids](http://i.imgur.com/MVL728w.png) are not just one hivemind, they have their own personalities despite coming off as minor characters that will only have short bits in each episode. That's great, they put enough care to animate them uniquely and give them their own individual charm.\n\nNow I'm not gonna say this was the best first episode of the season, even for non-sequels (love tyrant is the goat), and I won't really say this was a phenomenal start, but so far it's hit pretty much all the right notes for me and gotten me really, really excited for the rest of it.

   "text": "Very good first episode, probably the best non sequel premiere I've seen so far. It's really intriguing and compelling with its lack of exposition on the current state of the world they're living in. So humanity has been killed off and our MC, Willem [is the last human](http://puu.sh/vgUc5/b7dbf3c56e.jpg) There's a huge amount of potential for world building that will reveal what happened and how these other creatures came to be the superior race. If Willem is the last human, I wonder what the other girls are since they appear human. Also at the end of the episode, there was a flashback to like 500 years ago or something where Willem was speaking to his daughter which is pretty weird seeing as he's hardly aged from that point to where he is now. Lots of questions and mysteries from just this first episode which is very very promising!\n\nFrom what LN readers tell us this is a tragedy which is quite interesting and I wonder how they're going to incorporate that in. A downside of knowing that it's a tragedy is that it's made me really paranoid and [lines like this are setting off alarms](http://puu.sh/vgTJQ/e5990321bc.jpg) The fact that it's tagged as a romance makes it even worse, tragedic romances are like weaponised feels. The first scene is probably a glimpse of that tragedy and I assume that it's an event that takes place in the future somewhere down along the line. Or maybe it takes place in the past and I hope it does because that situation seems awful and two of our main characters, Willem and Kutori (was that her name?), were there. Also, maybe the morality issue with these kids being weapons is going to play a part in that tragedy but pls no that would be too sad, they're too adorbs\n\nCharacters are pretty interesting, especially our main character who seems to have a very tragic past which I'm eager to learn about. But he also seems like a cool guy and he has quite a lot of personality and charm which is always great for an MC given how many boring MCs we're exposed to. The girls were all very charming and great, especially Kutori and I'm interested to find out her backstory and see if a romance between her and Willem gets development. This is probably my favourite non sequel of the season so far and waiting each week for an episode is going to suck."

   "text": ">\"Huh? You'll fight to return alive just for cake?\"\n\nBitch I'll climb out of hell for cake!\n\n\nI decided to pick this up because the MAL synopsis sounded interesting. Especially this bit - \"...he feels the pain of helplessly waiting for his loved ones to return home...\" The guy lost everything in war and is the last remaining man (or so it says).\n\nGuessing from how the first episode went, I'd say there is some hope here (interesting music there). Really liked the little ones and how colorful & cheerful they were. I just hope that this doesn't go the usual route of the guys from the dark side attacking and our MC playing the usual role of a hero. From where it goes along the lines of \"we must defeat X to ensure peace in future\", and they have a battle finale which just magically fixes everything.\n\nI would prefer if such forces didn't show up and the show is more about him remembering/recollecting his past and slowly healing. Or even if they do show up, it still remains about the little family and not defeating some evil race of beasts."
