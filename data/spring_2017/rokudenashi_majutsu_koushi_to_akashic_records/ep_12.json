The focus of the show isn't even on Glenn but on Sistine and Rumia. I was expecting Glenn to show off some kind of magical talent ala Tatsuya but he doesn't and instead loses to the most basic of spells. I don't see any romantic connection between him and any of the girls either.\n\nI can't believe I'm gonna say this but maybe this is more akin to AssClass, but instead of the teacher teaching the students it will be the reverse and Glenn will learn from his students. Remember what Professor Blondie said? She wants Glenn to live his life. So maybe that will be the goal of the show? \n\nAnyway so far I am definitely in for this one!"

It had some nice animation there and there, and the lighting was lovely, it contrasted and supported well the colors and the animation.\n\nI believe it was a good first episode. We have some characterization and a taste for the comedy, which seems pretty unique until now, for me at least. The characters need more development but it was a good starting point. There was some dialogue that could have been cut out but I wont complaint about it, it wasn't something major. \n\nWe haven't had a Magic School Harem in a while, and this seems a good one.

   "text": "Eh, another high school show with all it's tropes and whatnot.\n\nThe MC seems pretty observant, but lacks the will to do much more than that. I'd like to think that he's just playing dumb, as forcing him to become a teacher as opposed to a student wouldn't really make sense if he wasn't actually able to teach anybody.\n\nHe seemed to take the bolt on purpose, so I imagine he was likely just testing the students to see what they were capable of. If the writing is on point, this would be confirmed by him changing the subject directly back towards how well she had done, as opposed to simply brushing it off.\n\nBased on the whole age thing, I think it's safe to assume that this is supposed to be a magic high school, so the normal starting age should be around 13. It seems like the characters are second or third years. Magic being as seemingly predominant in the world as it is, chances are the absolute basics are taught in their primary school. So that would imply that MC has a well enough understanding of the fundamentals of magic that he was able to skip 1-2 grades, but somewhere likely near the beginning of his high school experience, there was an event of some sort that put him off of learning magic. I say near the beginning, because of the principals disposition towards his achievements, and how he was only ever average... not what you would expect of somebody who had been implied to have been proficient at the lower level.\n\nThe weird thing is the teacher's attitude. It doesn't seem like he's necessarily depressed, but rather that he dislikes and has a disinterest in magic. That along with the pushing of the teacher role, and his strong recommendation by the other lady whom appears to be held in some high regard, inclines me to believe that the point of putting him into this position is to get him to accept magic as a part of his life. As if he were a student, he could merely shrug off his studies. Whereas as a teacher, he's going to be required to be able to explain to and teach students eventually, and so it is much less avoidable.\n\nEither way, it's funny enough. So long as it doesn't devolve anymore, it may stand to be a memorable show."

It was really reminiscent of shows like Asterisk War in that it was just filled with badly written trope characters, uninspired fight systems and a completely uninspired world. There was little to set this apart from most other shows in its genre, and it was honestly quite bad. Most of the characters had little to no personality to them, the battle system was pretty basic and uninspired, and the way tons of exposition was shoved in wasn't really a sign of good writing. The only redeeming factor this show had was that the main guy is kind of funny, but honestly he's just a bad Kazuma ripoff.\n\nOverall a pretty characterless episode that seems forgettable among all other LN high school battle series.

From this episode you could tell things about the uniqueness of the world, the personality of the characters, the fighting system, the comedy style, the writing, the setup, and the character interaction. You can predict an Anime to be good or bad (or at least good/bad to you) after one episode. It's never definite, but I still have the right to share that prediction.\n\nIn this episode it wasn't hard to notice that the show wasn't the most unique one, or that the main two sisters were fairly standard in personality. Sure, my rating *could* change over the course of the series, but that doesn't change my opinion on this episode as a pilot, which makes the series look mediocre and uninspired to me so far. It's not impossible to recognize good/bad Anime after one episode, and just like you have the right to like this show after one episode, I have the right to criticize it after one episode. That does not make be a snob, it makes me someone who is simply sharing their thoughts, just like everyone else in this thread is doing.\n\nAnd in regards to being 'hurt' about being called a snob: I'm not responding to you because I'm hurt by what you called me, but because you're an asshole.

   "text": "It is not a good drama. You fans wouldn't recognize a drama even if it hit you with a 20 ton truck.\n\nA good drama requires a good settling and dimensional characters, a based conflict and a resolution based on character personalities & traits. Not cardboard unidimensional characters from a shitty harem with restricted rules.\n\nThe Eriri arc falls down so easily the moment the MC pulls out of his ass that fake excuse that he was butthurt because Eriri neglected him during his childhood. That premise is total bullshit, either he's lying his ass off, or it's just a last minute asspull from the writer to woe gullible fans into his terrible writting. You see, a good character would reflect his/her beef during the series if he felt neglected throught his/her childhood, something that never happened to the MC. If it was a lie, Eriri just like the rest of the cast is a unidimensional cardboard character restricted to the dumb-down harem rule of being in love with the MC no matter what. A good written multidimensional character would recognize her traits (being a profesional mangaka) and say \"screw you and your stupid game\" I'm a reknowed mangaka and can live on my own, she would have some self respect and leave the useless MC with his dick in his hand. The writer would have thought of another way to bring her back into the game.\n\nBut it doesn't happen that way, it goes the most stupid way placing the guilt on Eriri and her metaphorically saying thank you and eating the MCs shit for it. And then we cut to the typical harem piggyride back home so fans will woe with it's fantastic writting <inset slow clapping>"

He definitely didn't felt neglected but that doesn't have to do with anything. Getting hurt from being ignored by your friend doesn't necessarily leads to feeling neglected, he still had parents, there's no way that could have happened.

   "text": ">Indeed, they do stick closely to the tropes but it is used satirically. \n\nYou don't even know what satirically means. If the show was a satire it would make fun of the tropes and look a way to change or better yet completely avoid them. But quite the opposite the series falls under the same tropes, like the scene at the hotel between Utaha and the MC where they try to mock all the instances where the virgin dense MC gets the chance to score with the gal but there will be several ways out for him to keep his stupid virginity, and yet they spend the night together making a dumb sex joke as an opener the morning after.\n\n>Why would he be lying his ass off?\n\nUm I don't know. Maybe because she's the only mangaka (and a damn profesional at it too) that would do all the artwork for his stupid game and would charge him 0 money for it? wich goes to my second point where all these artists fall on top of his lap, like Utaha being a famous writer that does the script for his game because the MC is just a useless hack. And same goes for his cousin that will become the music composer. All these talents just happen to be so close to his reach that it's just so BS.\n\nNow lets go back to Eriri. When she runs away and he confronts his rival on the hillclimb. The rival says he's going to get Eriri for his manga circle, the MC replies that he won't let him, that he will keep her for his own work. There's not a single line between that scene and the balcony scene where he states he's getting Eriri because he wants to keep the friendship bond alive, that pretty much states his interest in her as an asset for his work.\n\n> Is there anyone who would get hurt when a close friend suddenly ignores them, especially at that age? It definitely isn't an \"asspull\" either, this was adapted from a light novel.\n\nJust because it comes straight from the novel doesn't exempts it from being a shitty write up. \n\nIf you get hurt by some close friend or relative, you don't keep ties with him/her. You either ditch her for good, or confront her right at that time to keep the ties. You don't keep the petty grudge for years just to bring it up at the most convenient moment. Or if you're really THAT petty you're going to show discomfort by being near that friend everytime you're near her, wich doesn't happens. All that bullshit story about feeling neglected happened in that single episode, there was no buildup nor anything to back it up in previous episodes. That's why IT IS AN ASSPULL.\n\n>The whole thing happened cuz she wasn't given a straight answer and she needed an answer, not even self respect would have been able to do anything.\n\nShe didn't need an answer, she was asking for respect, to be acknowledged by the MC because he called her work amateurish and crap. Self respect would have made her a true character, not a walking cardboard TRAIT like the rest of the cast, but the MC managed to flip the roles from bully to victim and give her a guilt trip on a BS excuse. That my friend is pure unadulterated bullshit that clasifies that piece of shit in best case scenario as melodrama, not real drama.\n\nBut hey, keep telling to yourself this shitty doujin grade work has drama, maybe repeating it to yourself so many times you'll actually buy it.\n\n"

Between the rival hill climb scene and the balcony scene, there is a scene that shows that he is getting her back for the sake of friendship, episode 9 when he asked the rival to help him get the costume. I misinterpreted \"asspull\" there. Yes, if you get hurt by some close friend or relative, you don't keep ties with him/her, in this case, MC doesn't keep ties, almost, until the game. He kept a grudge, fine, but he also tried to keep it out of his mind, which was successful until the preschool scene. She does get respect from him as a mangaka and as a person, but respect was not she wanted here, she wanted to be the #1 in the doujin field in MC's eyes, that is why she bailed when he sang praises for the kouhai, especially when the kouhai's doujin is also about Little Love Rhapsody."

So no, Saikano isn't a satire, it's A parody.\n\n>Between the rival hill climb scene and the balcony scene, there is a scene that shows that he is getting her back for the sake of friendship, episode 9 when he asked the rival to help him get the costume.\n\nThere's no such scene. Take a screenshot and upload it to back up your words.\n\nOr maybe you're refering to this\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/aOUjR\n\nThe MC never states he's getting Eriri back as a friend. **He states he's getting her back in his circle**, because that's all it matters to him, his baby game. He hasn't shown any kind of *simpathy* towards Eriri nor the rest of the cast. That's why everyone praises the title for shitting in the waifu theme and getting away with it.\n\nLets analyze asspull number 2.\n\nThe MC asks his rival to help him out get his mangaka back into his circle. Why the fuck would his rival help him out? when getting Eriri for his own manga circle is what he wants. They aren't friends, they are hardly aquaintanced. Why the fuck would he help get Eriri back? there's no logic behind it other than AN ASSPULL.\n\n>He kept a grudge, fine, but he also tried to keep it out of his mind, which was successful until the preschool scene.\n\nKeeping it out of his mind and keeping it out of the audience as if it didn't exist are two different things. In order to pull out a twist like that the audience needs to have a precedent about this grudge to make it feasable since it changes the already pre-stablished character of Tomoya, making it absurd and unbelieveable.\n\n>She does get respect from him as a mangaka and as a person, but respect was not she wanted here, **she wanted** to be the **#1 in the doujin field in MC's eyes**, that is why she bailed when he sang praises for the kouhai\n\nIn order to get praise you first need to get the respect from whom you're seeking this praise, then you need to be acknowledged. You can't have one without the other.\n\nBack in the street scene where she bails, she does that because she's being neglected by the MC. It's never stated at that point that she wanted to become #1 mangaka in the MCs eyes (see how you can't even interpret a scene correctly)\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/HY8Pp\n\nMoving forth to the ridiculous balcony scene. \n\n\nYou say she gets respect from the MC as a mangaka and as a person. But she really doesn't. The MC makes the dick move to turn into the victim and shits on her work. He never apologizes nor recognizes her work as great (wich it is) and that's when she belittles herself saying she'll become #1 in front of his eyes, **not because she  wants to**, but because that's what it will take for him to **acknowledge her**.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/qo5tf\n\nYou're obviously not an avid drama follower, otherwise you would realize how contrived this whole sequence of events and ~asspulls~ (the sudden change of the MCs character & the change of heart from his rival) turn into  [forced unnatural plottwist](http://i.imgur.com/2oolN2p.jpg). \n\nThat's not what drama stands for.\n\n\n\n\n\n"
