Given the way the show paints him as a loaner, I can understand why he wouldn't necessarily want to risk his and Ryuzu's life for 20 million nameless faces.  Tragic or not, Naoto doesn't have any personal investment in them.  When he discovers someone close to his \"family\" is at risk, he suddenly has a reason to be personally invested.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nIt's a believable portrayal.  Unlike many shounens might lead you to believe, not everybody is willing put themselves at risk for \"the greater good.\"  (A feeling I can get behind.)  Personal investment is a major motivation for these kinds of things.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThat said, the show definitely played it for laughs with his reaction to the idea of a robot imouto.

I think it was better to keep it constant.\n\n[About imaginary time](/s \"Clockwork Planet doesn't really care about actual science with regards to Y. Part of its plot revolves around the idea that paradoxes have been proven to exist, and basically Y just decided that 'If nature has proven that the impossible is possible (i.e. a paradox exists), then what stops me from doing the impossible?'.\")\n\n[About Nao's relation to that](/s \"The reason that Nao was able to fix it is because he doesn't get stuck thinking about theoretical physics and all that jazz and just does what reality allows him to do, which, going back to the paradoxes, is everything as the impossible is already proven possible.\")\n\nNot wholly unsurprising, similar logic is used in No Game, No Life. Yuu Kamiya quite likes these impossible leaps in logic to explain how people are achieving totally absurd things. I personally find it quite fascinating to read, but I totally understand that it is not for everyone."

Still have no reason to care for him besides for the robot girl following him.  \n-PHD tsundere has no real character either. She's kinda just driving the plot right now as a motivator, except now the motivation is the loli robo so she's useless again.  \n-robo butler is similarly useless but is at least a \"softhearted but tuff bodyguard\" type. I have no attachment to him.  \n-\"World is gonna end because the world feels like ending\" no motivation or speculation or exposition on why the military is trying to end japan. After 3 episodes it's safe to say this plot has gotten nowhere, despite being centered entirely on it.  \n-Everything is still clockwork without a real reason for it being clockwork. Only MC's superpower and the rest of the people's abilities even rely on \"clockwork.\" It's just a reskinned superhero show where clocks don't mean anything.  \n\nI mean people might get mad at criticism but it's hard not to criticize things. It's an easy drop and I'll probably look at these threads pop up but feel no motivation to watch them anymore so I'll just put it off forever. They really should have taken a quick reflection of the pacing, setting, and comedy before trying to go all out like this. A standard world-building crescendo could have saved them the pain, they could have made clocks even relevant to the setting besides background images, they could have been more up to date with the comedy and art, they could have made me care more about the characters and the world first.\n\nIt's obviously someone's life work but it's just executed so mediocre."

We have that. The world is built and fairly well explained. Some things are obviously left to our own suspension of belief, but this is sci-fi we are talking about. If steam punk worlds are given a pass why can't this clockwork world have one?\n\nDoes every show have to be top tier, waifu war, ufotable/Pa works animation, Clannad feels, nsfw handholding, marianas trench deep, Shinsekai Yori's worldbuilding and Your Name levels of pacing?\n\nThe answer is no. \n\nI watch anime to enjoy it. If the anime has really glaring faults it's noticeable and I won't enjoy it as much, but Clockwork planet hasn't had any large hiccups to lessen my enjoyment of the show. \n\nI honestly feel like some of the commenters here are purposefully jumping on the bandwagon of \"This show isn't the magnum opus the LN or manga was so it's shit.\" Just because the show isn't your cup of tea or it didn't interesting you doesn't mean you have to say it's bad. Just say you dropped it for x and y reasons without saying or implying x and y reasons are somehow bad things for a show to have. Of course, I can't ask everyone to be truly objective. Just for people to be objective when expressing their subjective.\n\nTLDR\nAnimation is average.\nPlot is Decent, not deep.\nCharacters are quirky.\nShow is baseline the dictionary definition of Entertainment.\nWhether it'll be entertaining to you is subjective.\n\nIn the end, the old-fashioned animation could be a style choice since the story itself was pretty old. Even the OP/ED style feels older though that could just be me making the connection between this show and Index/railgun, because of Fripside being the singer of both shows.\n\n"

It seems to be more character drama based (as the fight scenes are lazy and laughable. Oh boy, lots of slicing effects with still characters. So thrilling) but the main character doesn't make me care about him in any way, he just yells, all the time. The \"love comedy scenes\" are way too drawn out as well, and just plain stupid (IMO), and making self conscious joke about it isn't going to make up for it. \n\nLove the concept, but thats about it.

Automaton loli > 20M people lol. RyuZU is straight up savage with her remarks. Halter is cool and sensible, and I think Marie is going to end up tsuper tsundere or not at all, and seeing her getting defeated by Naota's logic is pretty hilarious. And the scene where Naota puts his hands on RyuZU's, what turned out to be shoulders, RyuZU's eyes shift left awkwardly, \".....yes?\" and \"you have broken mankind's scale of measuring perversion\" got a good chuckle out of me.\n\nNext episode: ravioli ravioli don't lewd the automaton loli"
