   "text": "Hijacking to talk about the lore in this episode...\n\nI went back and revised the ending of season 1/Bahamut Genesis, because things felt quite odd and out of order. In this episode, we're shown Jeanne's history since Bahamut, of course you can't expect to cover every detail but the gist is there. She was captain of Orlean Knights above Kaiser, her fall from grace began with her questioning the new king (who seems to have appeared completely out of nowhere), has something like immaculate conception, then the story goes on.\n\nI felt like there was a disconnect in the explanation of the story thus far. In the end of season 1, Jeanne basically became a demon through the angatonist (Martinet), then became human again as she \"killed\" Archangel Michael as Michael administered the antidote. Then after all said and done, she is seen with short hair in the Orlean Knights, where she seems to be of a lower status than Kaiser. Also, the King's ceremony seemed a lot more formal judging by what was shown, however brief. It's at the end of episode 12 in Genesis.\n\nThis episode shows Jeanne as the captain and her \"fall from grace\", but it all felt sorta... forced. Maybe it's the sudden appearance of Charioce who has no expanded backstory yet, or how she seemed to be in different positions at the end of Genesis and here... Not to mention the long hair, the difference stands out. For some reason, accepting all of this franchise's chaotic happenings, this disconnect strikes me as quite illogical.\n\nAnyone else feel the same? Or am I looking too deep into it, or did I miss something? \n"

   "text": "How i see El/Mugaro feelings and status right now: Listen to the Lyrics https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oGdjaLmLqw However power was behind Jeanne de'Arc giving birth to El/Mugaro, could sing this Song through her Mind.. (well i am a bit overdoing it here.. sorry) but this is my best guess to show you what i feel about El/Mugaro path he/she is walking\n\nThis Song could be used to born the real Head ArcAngel Michael (or his child) in this Bahamut anime in the Finals. \n\nSorry, i love Fan fiction\n"

I believe an anime should use the fact it has more episodes to provide more content not stretch out the amount of content that would usually be done in half the amount of episodes. I Have the same problem with Re: creators but it's characters aren't as good as the ones in Bahamut.\n\n\nThe characters have been keeping invested but they should have gotten Jeanne and got out of the city by episode 5. It really does seam like the show is dragging the story."

   "text": "riiight, also \"they should have gotten Jeanne and got out of the city by episode 5\"? You're joking right? You should not think of these types of episode(like the recent one) as mere \"dragging the story\" since these are like \"setups\" to the future events thats going to happen. Let me give you an example.\n\nBack in the festival episode, sure it has some \"dragging the episode\" parts like Nina and Charioce's date but it also has some interesting stuff like Azazel's plan. So whats the point of the date? Its pretty much a setup for whats gonna happen in the next few episodes where Nina didnt go to the meeting place and failed to transform into a dragon.\n\nI used to think of these kinds of episodes as \"ahh another all talk episode so boring\" but now it just makes me think about whats gonna happen in the next few episodes with the info we got now which is i guess... exciting? Anyway, I dont care man. Go enjoy what u feel is enjoyable. Cheers"
