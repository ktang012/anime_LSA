Before, Kakashi had one normal eye and one sharigan eye which the sharingan eye was then stolen by Madara, then replaced by Naruto (post-Sage of the Sixth paths encounter). At this point Kakashi now just has two normal eyes. \n\n(This is the speculation part) Then when Obito allowed Kakashi to \"borrow\" his two sharigan he most likely just swapped his two sharigan eyes with Kakashi's two normal eyes just for the Kaguya fight. My reasoning for this is in the anime (episode 473 \"The Sharingan revived\"), Kakashi spoke to Obito in their childhood bodies (right before Kakashi saved Sakura with his Susano form). In the anime, Kakashi simply closed his eyes, spoke to Obito in the other \"blank space\" looking realm, reopened his eyes with the borrowed sharigans, defeated Kaguya, then is shown with his two normal eyes again.\n\nThis is just my speculation but I also summarized/recapped the scene so feel free to share your own speculation."

Yes, the hokage are very powerful in terms of combat but that factor should not be seen as the only reason he became hokage. A very good example is shown near the end of the Great Ninja War when everyone was severely injured and demoralized. At this moment, Naruto gave a compelling speech that motivated everyone enough to get back up and continue fighting. I forgot who, but someone in the show mentioned after Naruto did this that this is the reason why Naruto is someone that is fitting for the role of hokage. Another example is Itachi's words saying that you do not become Hokage to be acknowledged. The one who is acknowledged becomes Hokage.\n\nYes, I do agree that being hokage requires you to be a powerful ninja (most powerful? not sure if they have to be #1 strongest but for sure one of the strongest). But to say:\n\n> Kakashi was made Hokage because he had now two sharingans which makes him really powerful but I guess he was still the most powerful ninja in the village outside of Naruto\n\nis not correct. Kakashi is undoubtedly strong but he is also acknowledged and respected by the village."

I just think that a kage should have a gimmick, either something with elements like lava or a special technique like Tsunade or Gaara have that are very very powerful. Sure Chidori is strong but its not quite as strong as those two. Essentialy when Kakashi was hokage then anyone could have been a hokage. He wasnt special by any means anymore. He was still a great ninja but you cant possibly argue that he is stronger without sharingan than he is with one."

   "text": "Forgotten or not, I do not see why people remembering about Kakashi's father would be a drawback of him being acknowledged or respected. Yes at the start of the show it was seen as unhonorable by the village to abandon your mission for your teammates. But as the series went on, one of the main themes of the show is to prioritize your friends and allies over the mission. This was ultimately Kakashi's main and first lesson through the bell training. Despite the way the village treated his father, Kakashi still believed that his fathers actions were correct (whether he realized that immediately after his father's incident or later is a different question). If Kakashi going through that and teaching that lesson to the next generation isn't at all acknowledgable or respectable, I'm not sure what is. Yes you could argue that every other ninja in the village in the current generation abides by these rules, but look at it this way. His father's generation it was looked down upon to priorize comrades over the mission but even so, Kakashi still sought to priotize his comrades over the mission despite the way the village saw it (which I say is respectable) and wanted that to be the very first lesson to pass down to the next generation (which I see as acknowledgable).\n\nAlso, on the part that Kakashi doesn't have gimmick he still a bit does. I completely agree that he is weaker without the sharingan, no argument there. He is no longer \"Kakashi of the Sharingan\" but still holds the thousands of jutsus he has copied. The sharingan allowed him to mimic others hand signs which he can no longer do anymore, but as long as he still remembers the hand signs of the jutsus he has copied, he can still perform all of them.\n\nThere was also the side effect of him having the sharingan without Uchiha blood. As you probably remember, the reason he covered his sharingan with his headband was because he was unable to deactive his sharingan meaning it was constantly draining his chakra. I do not think that this trade benefits him but just thought to throw that in as a bonus."

Naruto is a decent example of this.  He has his regular chakra, but the nine tailed fox's chakra also exists within him.

It's nice if it also stays consistent with stuff from story arcs from years ago, but sooner or later there's going to be inconsistencies. That's just how a show like this works.\n\n(One can compare it to superhero's or Doctor Who. There's stuff that stays consistent, but there's also tons of retcons and contradictions in the continuity. People just gotta enjoy that and go with the flow.)"

When I think back that last episode I said that Naruto was insensitive about his comment on family, but I really hope (but doubt it) that Boruto will understand with this that a same phrase can have almost opposite implication according to the speaker's experience.\n\nBut outside of that, I feel this phrase also encompass well the major theme of the series. These children have to cope not only with their parents duties, like we saw last episode, but also their heritage. While Boruto was lucky to have parents that in retrospect let him do what he want (I think in large part thanks to Naruto's own free childhood that forged him), Sumire on the other hand is completely smothered by the expectations her father quite literally imprisoned her in. Except if they decide to surprise us, I can easily see the conclusion being Boruto managing to free her from these shackles with \"talk no jutsu\" but I really liked how they managed the themes these past episodes."

I get that he could ass pull, they ass pulled in Naruto when he was young, but there was merit behind it, he only fought with the one tail because he trained and could summon bunta, Boruto has showed no training and isn't even a Genin, can we slow down"

Everything before that point you were given the clear feeling that they were too inexperienced to deal with the threats they faced, and they themselves emitted that fear and inexperience. Even when Sasuke and Naruto fought Haku they were clearly flustered and had Sasuke not awakened Sharingan and Naruto not gotten saved by Kyuubi chakra they were both dead. "

In fact it would seem like with team work they could overcome that situation. In reality though even in a weakened or not serious state the power gap there should be so massive that the characters efforts feel completely wasted. Lets think about Kakashi's first test on team 7 with the bells. No matter how skilled and talented they were watching you knew they had absolutely no chance of getting a bell and that their was simply a different level between a Jonin and freshly graduated Gennin, even in a group with a genius Uchiha. This feeling of helplessness is carried on from that point probably up till the Assault on the Konohana during the Chunin exams, which at that point they're clearly all at a Chunin level and ready for higher level missions. \n\nBoruto and crew aren't even Genin yet, they haven't even graduated, to go even further, correct me if i'm wrong but this is literally their first year in the Ninja academy, yet they're getting ready to face off against the first antagonist and have yet to give off anything close to that kind of vibe.\n"
