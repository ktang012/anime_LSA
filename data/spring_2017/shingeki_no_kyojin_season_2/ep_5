   "text": "Jean's situation really sucks right now. Everyone is off doing stuff while he's been in the dark.\n\nFrom his perspective, he was hired as part of the secret mission to capture Annie, and was given the super important job of. . . cosplaying as Eren in disguise. So he does that. Big fight breaks out and he survives, and they win. . . but then Annie crystalizes and it's all in vain.\n\nThen HOURS later, he gets news that there are Titans in Wall Rose. What. So he rides out to Trost along with Erwin, and he just has to sit there, anxiously awaiting news and updates. Then Sasha and the other guy show up and explain what's going on. His buddies are all out there fighting, *and three of them are Titans*. And he didn't even get to find out which three yet. He doesn't know who's a traitor and who's alive or dead or what. Now he's gotta go on a suicidal mission and help save Eren.\n\nJeez. Poor horse."

Might be different in a world of \"passive/normalized danger\" where your role as a parent is \"teach them how to make it through, so they can succeed on their own,\" but they went through trauma before (where he saves Mikasa, and she has to kill to save him right back) and it's a world with lots of passive danger from humans, AND Eren dreams of living beyond the walls, where the titans still are.\n\nDude has a massive deathwish.  ;-)\n\nSo because Eren is too boneheaded and Mikasa's concern (to the point of desperation) never reads as \"romantic,\" I can only place her in the parental role.\n\nAlso, Eren didn't \"stay calm,\" he just managed to calm himself down at some point during the fight.  He was angry flailing up until the point where \"angry shounen flailing would normally work, but this time got shut down immediately by Reiner again\" and only THEN did he start to regain some composure and think tactically.\n\nSo congratulations for that much, at least?  But his innate personality gets him in huge trouble first, even if he could have pulled himself out of it this once.  Not great data sampling for Mikasa to be confident in.  ;-)"

But I have watched enough anime and shounen to feel like I know where this is heading.\n\nStatements like \"always by his side\", those deep looks, over-protective nature, other characters dropping hints about the two of them. I know none of this is concrete, but judging from all the other anime I have watched, those are some pretty strong signs of romantic interest imo. \n\nAnd while AoT is more violent compared to other anime and kills off side characters regularly, the show hasn't really done anything to show me they aren't following the usual anime tropes closely."

   "text": "...and that is how I perceive it.  ;-)\n\nAlso your Samurai Jack comments would have to spoil me on a while lot more before you could spoil me on two characters I don't know.  hehe...\n\nWhile \"always want to be by his side\" does read romantic, very little for the whole run has.  It has read as \"worry worry worry worry don't get in trouble, don't make your mom worry, get home in time, save him from bullies, save him from himself, keep an eye on him in combat...\"\n\nEven early on when she thought Eren had been eaten by the titan and was gone and she was despondent, it read more like \"my child is gone why bother living\" than \"I no longer have the man I love!\"\n\nGranted some of this is because Eren is such a goddamn dink most of the time that I can't see anyone BEING in romantic love with him.  (And Mikasa deserves better than a dink.  ;-) )  And they're all pretty oblivious to personal relationships and social cues, and are kind of consumed in their own insular world except when titans are trying to step on them.\n\nBut even NOW it doesn't read \"romantic\" more than familial concern.  Maybe it'll go that way.  The author certainly hasn't set them up for anyone else, BUT he also set them up to be effectively siblings, which is a hard bridge to cross.  (Unless you are writing Eromanga Sensei.)  \n\nAdmittedly Mikasa never quite gets as far as calling Eren's parents \"mom\" or \"dad\" herself, but she lost her family (and apparently all her race), almost got raped/sold into slavery/killed because of it, and was taken in by the Yeagers, and her drive has always been one of familial support and nurturing those bonds, even when Eren struggled against them as a child.  And after the titans...  it's been desperation and survival, then revenge and more desperation.\n\nSo yes...  sure?  I suppose?  Romance is always a possibility.  But it doesn't feel particularly real even yet.  Excepting perhaps by how one perceives relationships.  ;-)"

In one of the filler episodes of naruto (I'm watching it for the first time... just got to shippuuden, but hot damn were those 85ish straight episodes of filler painful) a character starts to slow down because of some plot reason and they have that character switch to running normally. In Naruto it's an artistic choice (well, okay, in the anime that seems true, but  in the original manga it might be easier to demonstrate someone is running with a single frame of them with their arms out like that, I dunno), but in everything else it's pretty normal to show running animations unless you kinda want a dorky naruto reference I'm pretty sure."

And she jumped on a titan with nothing but an arrow in hand. It takes bravery to do that kind of shit. \n\nSasha is my spirit animal.\n\nIsayama, please don't let her die by sacrificing herself while protecting someone. Actually, that almost happened. She's going to be eaten, isn't she? Hajime, you sick bastard."

   "text": "Erwin was prepared for any enemy, not the Female Titan specifically.\n\nAfter discovering about Eren, the reports about the Colossal and Armored and the death two capture titans, Sonny and Bean, Erwin theorized that there could be more humans that could transform into titans that got inside the walls and that they were infiltrated in the military (since Sonny and Bean were killed with the use of a 3DMG).\n\nThen Erwin devised a plan in the form of the 57th expedition. This expedition would use Eren as bait to draw any enemies that could be after him, it was never intended to reach Shiganshina or Wall Maria. The enemies obviously stopped the siege to Wall Rose after Eren's appearance,  with this information Erwin concluded that Eren may be their objective. Erwin was prepared for any enemy, not the Female Titan specifically.\n\n>Later keeping Eren's position in the formation wouldn't have been to keep him hidden from shifters specifically.\n\nI don't understand what you meant by this. Eren was the bait for the enemies to bite."

So lets start the \"whos going to die\" guesses. I'm thinking that they'll kill erwin off here, he's way too awesome not to die at some point, plus it gives a direction for armin/hange to move up into more important positions.

He's just significant enough to leave an emotional impact but not that important in the grand scheme of things. Jean's possible, but he's been almost non-existent this season. Probably would've been better to do it last season. I think Connie and Sasha are the most likely of the 104th (and maybe one of the titan shifters not named Eren), but I hope not."

The show has constantly reminded us that this never works out for him though, he's usually out numbered and even when he doesn't ask for or even want help Mikasa always rushes to his side to take the spotlight from him. At that point it everyone always tells Eren to just stand back and let Mikasa handle it.\n\nIts easy to see how this is very frustrating, especially for a child. Eren just wants to stand on his own two feet and Mikasa won't let him. How can he ever improve if he doesn't learn to lose every now and again? He just wants to go out on his own and carve his own path in life but his helicopter parent Mikasa wont allow him to leave the nest."

To compare it to Naruto again, Kakashi is also one of the best at everything, but he's a likeable character because he has more dimensions than just being good at what he does. \n\nI watch the show for the action setpieces, because they are well animated and welldirected.
