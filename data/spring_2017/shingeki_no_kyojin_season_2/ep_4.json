End of the first season is probably the biggest change, but fiery rage Eren and injured Levi inconsistently swooping in do not actually impact the later story in any way.  Otherwise, the scenes added on the way back from the expedition are a change, but a good one, in my opinion.  Nothing else really comes to mind.

He is not there to say \"I really want to save humanity\" he is there to say \"I want to butcher humanities enemies\", it's not false bravado or anything either, these are the seeds of a life of hate where he has little to no fear for his own life because he will give everything to destroy the enemy. Again, the distinction is very important for his character - he is not self-sacrificing because he puts himself in harms way to protect others, he is extremely selfish in how he wants to violently kill titans no matter the consequence.\n\nIn the context of AoT specifically, and I've said this before on the episode discussions, I love him as a representation of humanities rage. Everyone else seems entirely too blase about the impending titan death, they are either used to the status quo (Connie, Sasha) or worn down by the war (Mikasa, Levi). That's not to say they aren't fighting back, but Eren is very much the character who represents that fight even though he is naiive and lets his emotions get the best of him way too often. \n\nHell, if you don't think Eren is a good character (even if you don't like him) then you should think the same for Connie and Krista. Both represent other aspects of humanity and Krista especially acts pretty naiively given what she knows of the world. \n\nYou might small it a small twist but I think it's very important if you're comparing his characters to others and especially if you are calling him badly written.

He's not bad but he's certainly not one of those protags that excel at anything just cause.\n2. Actually making a weakness out of his greatest strentgh: his willpower and determination. Here it's coupled with a very hot headed attitude and lack of judgement, so a lot of the time Eren ends up not seing his threats through at all or just fucking it all up.\n\nI understand why some people may not like him, but I love him precisely for being a typical shonen protagonist seen through a relatively more realistic, tougher perspective."

Whenever a new chapter comes out where something really cool happens, I think: wow, I can't wait until I see this animated.  When I eventually do see it animated, it is really satisfying.\n  \nHowever, this doesn't mean that reading the manga is less fun, because I can't stand waiting for new story, and the manga is where I get that.  What draws me most to Attack on Titan is the characters, the story, and the mystery of the world.  By reading the manga, I get to experience those things now.  Every month, a bit more is revealed.  I just couldn't stand waiting and wondering about all that stuff when the answer is available. \n  \nI don't really hear the lines in the manga in the anime characters' voices.  I watch the anime subbed, not dubbed, so the voices I associate most with the characters don't speak English.  ;)  I watched a few episodes of the dub, but I don't really like it.  It has some great voice-actors for sure, but once I associated the Japanese voices with the characters, everything else sounded fake.  Especially Levi.  To me, subbed Levi sounds detached and self-assured in a down-to-earth, unexaggerated way.  I think that dubbed Levi sounds like a stereotypical \"tough guy\" who is more full of himself than his ability warrants.  (That's not at all how Levi should sound, because he really is the best fighter!)  So I guess, to me, the characters in the manga just have their \"own\" voice, like any book you read whose adaptation you haven't seen in English?\n  \nMy experience mightn't be the same as everyone else's.  I read the first sixty or so chapters of the manga before I watched a single episode of the anime, so I don't know if someone who watched all the available anime before reading a single chapter of the manga would feel the same as me.  But I can only say that the art in the manga, while rough in the first handful of chapters, is much improved now, to the point where it's really harmonized with the anime.  Many times in the anime, especially recently, it's as if the artists traced over some frame from the manga.\n  \nMaybe the only person who could convince you would be someone who watched the anime and then read the manga.  Or maybe you don't care about waiting.  Even if it takes years, maybe you just want to see the story first in its animated form.  But if you're like me and hate waiting, then I really recommend jumping to the manga when this season is over.  \n  \nSorry if this answer was too long.  x)  Um...\n   \nTL;DR: The anime is a pretty dressing-up of the most important elements of Attack on Titan, all of which are present in the manga.  If you care most about the world, characters, and story, then read the manga!  :)"

Maybe I'll wait around until they announce the release date of season 3, and if it turns out I can't wait that long, or if something crazy like a year has passed before they do so, I'll just switch over to the manga. \n\nI absolutely love this show, and it's my real first anime that I've watched, so it's awesome to have someplace to discuss it after the fact.\n\nThanks for the answer, and don't sweat it being too long. The reason I replied to your comment was because I wanted more detail of your experience :)"

SNK has a stronger theme of \"everyone being the hero of their own story\", ala Game of Thrones than your typical battle shounen. \n\nBoth sides believe they're the good guys, and we only have the initial invasion lead by B and R as the Colossal and Armoured titans to show their actions have been villainous. Who knows if there was some human war where their ancestors were killed on a far larger scale. While that's a far stretch my point is neither side is objectively good or evil. \n\nAs for whether Reiner is interesting and his use in the story, then we'll have to agree to disagree. "

Like I said, the concept started from our own interest that, when we are on the losing side, we shouldn't suffer that fate. \n\nI'm not an expert on the subject, but I think the reason the USA was excusing itself for nuking those places, were that they held important military infrastructure. (thus they were not targeting civilians, but the military structure). \n\nI don't know if that's true, maybe that's just propaganda, but it certainly was overkill.\n\nI do grant you though, that the punishment for you engaging in a war crime, is miniscule where you are the winner and still hold power. Even then, the fact that this is criticized for it, is still a form a punishment. And currently, the USA is considered troughout the world as one of the biggest threats to peace. That is saying something, that they are not impervious to criticism for it's own acts of war crime. \n\n> nobel prizes\n\nI wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that the ones who decides who gets those prizes, are not the people who risk suffering from their inventions, but the people who benefit from them (the warmongers)"

   "text": "I just want to emphasize just how much and how little time has passed. This is all made pretty clear in the episodes themselves, but I want to lay it all out. Try to understand just how insane this has all been for Eren.\n\nEren saves Mikasa and they adopt her in year 844, one year before Wall Maria falls, when they are both 9 years old.\n\nWall Maria falls in year 845. Eren and most of the characters are 10. Annie is 11. Reiner, Bert, Ymir are 12. 10 000 people die in the initial chaos of it all. His mother is eaten right in front of his eyes. His father just disappears. He's lost his home and his family, and all he has left is his sister, is best friend, occasionally Hannes the drunk uncle, and his rage.\n\nEren and his friends spend *two years* trying to subsist, mostly on the failed government farms. When tensions start building up within the Walls, the nobility condemns 250 000 people to their operation to retake Wall Maria. It's all a sham, of course. But one-fifth of humanity is just *gone* now.\n\nSo then, at last, year 847, they all join the military. At the age of 12. They meet new people! On the very first day, he starts a friendship with Reiner and Bert. RB sympathize with him. They *understand* his feelings! They were also from Wall Maria and also have a drive to return to their \"Hometown\"! So they all train and train and train. They have good times together. Reiner is practically an older brother to him! Annie, though cold-hearted, is nice enough to give him some life lessons, and even imparts her amazing fighting skills! Bert's quiet and Ymir is off doing her thing, but whatever. They're all brave Soldiers of humanity, working together to smite the Titans and save mankind!\n\nAt last, year 850, they're all set to graduate! Then, suddenly, the Colossal attacks, AGAIN. Eren's not going to take this one easily. He's the nearest soldier. He attacks, and he almost has it! But then it just disappears into mist. He was so close to taking down humanity's greatest menace, but it's just like trying to grab smoke. Then his whole squad dies in their very first engagement, and he nearly *dies*. And he does it willingly. He couldn't achieve his dream, but at least he could buy some more time. For Armin. For his friends. For humanity.\n\nThen weirder and weirder things start happening. He has Titan powers? What did his dad do?! What the hell is going on?!?! Questions, questions, questions, with no damn answers. His friends don't trust him, his government doesn't trust him. He's only got about a month to process all of this before they do the next thing.\n\nThen begins the Operation, basically kickstarting the worst week of his life.\n\nHe's sequestered in the center of the formation while all his friends are all over the place, fighting, dying, and he doesn't know what's going on. He's ordered to just keep moving. Then they're in the forest, and he's watching soldiers be brutally killed just to buy him some time. He wants to fight, but Squad Levi drills it into their head to trust them, trust them, trust them. Then they promptly all die, right in front of him, and he's stuck with the guilt that maybe if he didn't listen to them, he could have saved them and captured the Female Titan. Then HE fights the FT, and despite all his rage, he gets rekt. Hard. Then Levi and Mikasa have to rescue him, and they all gotta head back. In shame. He sees the wide eyes of the children, in awe at their heroes. He sees the glares of the adults, angry at another failure. He's crushed.\n\nThen Erwin pulls them all aside, and tells them that it was ***Annie***. who did all of this. How can this be? His friend, his mentor, his teacher. He trained with her for three long years, this can't be possible. It's *not* possible. But slowly he starts to realize - she's a damn traitor! And he fights her again. And now, at last, they win! All together, they *win!*\n\n\"Tell me, Annie. Why are you fighting? What great cause lets you kill people?\"\n\n. . . And then she immediately locks herself in her crystal. They have gained nothing. No new knowledge. What a waste.\n\n. . . And then, mere hours later, they get word that Titans have appeared in Wall Rose, and his friends are out fighting without him. Again.\n\nSo they all rush out and arrive just in time to save the day!\n\n. . . Then Hange gives them the news. Reiner and Bert are suspicious? Impossible. These are some of his best friends. He doesn't buy it.\n\n. . . Then they just casually tell him that, yes, they did it all. Just nonchalantly spill the beans. \n\n\"Haha, yeah, funny story, we did that thing once, please come with us.\"\n\nSo, once again, he's fighting his friends. He uses logic, reason, tactics. He does his work. And he's winning! He's seconds from victory! Then the world goes dark, and we wakes up in some trees, disarmed and helpless.\n\nNow these guys are just having random chats. To borrow an analogy, it's like you're with a bunch of your friends and hey start talking about high school memories - of a high school you've never been to. They're ALL operating at a level above him, and they won't even give him crumbs. He tries to keep calm, but how can he?\n\nThese were his friends, his comrades. He knew them for three long years. Now they're murderers and monsters and, in his eyes, the source of all strife and trouble in this world. He's spent years and years dreaming of the day he can save humanity. And these people - these *traitors* - were right under his nose all along. Lying, for three years! And now Ymir, the only one who *might* be on his side - won't tell him anything. Belittles his struggles and humanity.\n\nAnd this is all literally just the day after he fought Annie. In 2 days, it's all come crashing down. He's had fight after fight. He's barely rested. He can hardly process any of this as it is.\n\nYou think *you're* angry at not getting answers? Imagine how Eren must feel about all of this."

But the Season 2 premiere shows that they get the news of the attack on the same day as the Stohess fight."

I forget how big a gap in time it was between Bertholt destroying Trost's outer gate and whenever Reiner may have learned of Eren's ability, but it seemed like it was longer than the time between Bertholt destroying Shiganshina's outer gate and Reiner destroying the inner gate.\n\nI have a feeling the Beast Titan as a shifter represents some divergent faction from Bertholt/Reiner but that he's similarly testing humanity's response to titan intrusions. It seems obvious that the Beast shifter possesses [AoT Speculation](/s \"some method to turn humans into the common mindless titans, their sudden transformations explaining the destruction of their homes, their subsequent disappearance along with the intact state of the wall. It may be a reworked serum like what Eren's dad used so the common titans can move at night and the Beast just wanted to experiment. What he reworked it from may be how all titans emerged 105 years ago.\")"

She has also paired this with a scarf over her hair and head.'  That makes me seem like she is hiding defining hair/eye features of the royal family.  The members inside the walls do -not- have those features, which makes me wonder if they practiced selective breeding since erecting the walls and the hidden king's choice of a blonde woman as mistress is what caused so many problems in the nobility (recessive traits and all) \")"

He doesn't want to tell Eren too much, so he carries on a veiled conversation with Ymir, and once he makes a point that hits home with her, he also gives her a reason not to tell Eren too much.

Hell of a first impression...\n\n- Speaking of Eren, I applaud him for at least attempting to suppress his emotions. Of course it didn't last very long but it's the thought that counts.\n\n- Welp, here is our answer as to Reiner\u2019s state of mind a couple episode back; he has a split-personality disorder and is constantly flipping between the personas. It explains how he can willingly risk his life for Connie one second, then endanger the lives of the Survey Corps the next. He wasn\u2019t putting on act back then; that was really him.\n\n- And as Ymir pointed out, this seems to happen regularly and I bet poor Bert enables Reiner each time. It makes me sympathetic towards the duo and it\u2019s an effective way of humanizing them. Not often do we get to delve into the psyche of antagonists like this.\n\n- Ymir probably knows more than everyone up in the trees and looked pretty sure of herself until Reiner shut her down with the waifu card.\n\n- Hey guys, remember Marco? You probably don\u2019t because he died relatively early but now we get a hint as to what happened.\n\n- Reiner\u2019s split-personality must have been at work back then since he was genuinely shocked that Marco was being eaten despite looking like he wanted to kill him 5 seconds earlier. BTW, [this](http://imgur.com/UP6upI2) [scene](http://imgur.com/ZfssRYS) was [shown](http://imgur.com/UXd14mM) way back in S1 which starts to piece things together.\n\nTo say there was a lot to unpack this week would be a huge understatement.

Maybe even they are at the mercy of it?  Sure, it doesn't remove responsibility - they made their own choices - but there's a lot of the big picture missing right now.\n  \nI also don't think they tried to make Eren look like an idiot.  He made the decision to try to control his emotions, but, like anyone, he has his limits and can only be pushed so far.  He just couldn't expect that turn of events with Reiner's split personality.  He's understandably outraged that the people who caused such death and suffering can act like they're anything other than one-dimensional villains.  His reaction makes sense from his point of view, because he doesn't know very much.  Ymir can only tell him not to react childishly because she knows a lot more.  In fact, everyone else there knows more than him - enough to help them make their decisions, while leaving him in the dark.  He tried to control his emotions, but it turning out that they know so much and he knows so little only makes him angrier."

They must have learned something so unspeakably disturbing that they think humanity has no chance of surviving. Thus they had to make a choice. The problem is what was the choice? Also take into account that they were 12 or so at the time most likely or just very young when they made their choice.\n\nMy bet is their choice is more of a selfish goal. Either to just survive the coming apocalypse or to fulfill a wish of some sort. They might have been promised something that only the enemy of sorts can provide that they think is worth fighting for since there is no point in fighting to try to save humanity, since there is no hope.\n\nThose are only guesses. What else could you promise a 12 year to do such horrible things after they realize there is no hope for humanity. Like if they could see the future and knew a meteor would strike the Earth in 10 days, but someone gave them an offer. I don't think killing people so they don't see the coming apocalypse is a good enough reason, but maybe if it's a fate much much worse then death."

   "text": "**SNK 9**\n\n* 'You just stay here and faint or something' And for once Hanji is cooperative and promptly does\n\n* That's some hype music for riding. Thanks once again, Sawano\n\n* Good call people who guessed Eren lost his arms from Reiner biting them off in the nape by accident\n\n* I still feel that Bert and Reiner aren't all \"die humans die.\" Bert especially when he told Eren to bite himself, he had an air of meaning \"don't do something you'll regret\" to him. All their lives, or at least since they've been shifters, I reckon they've wanted to cooperate with their fellow humans\n\n* Reiner, Bert and Eren are all main characters and until recently Ymir has been much more in the background. As an aspiring writer, her sudden elevation to the limelight is interesting\n\n* There's been a few leg pan up shots of Ymir. Not that I'm complaining [](#datass)\n\n* Eren, don't mention the survey corps. Don't put them in Reiner and Bert's mind. \n\n* Eren before wouldn't be as calm to have come to the conclusion that he needs to bide his time and learn what he can to escape. Good old character development . But suppressing his emotions? His hardest challenge yet\n\n* Typical Mikasa surging ahead when it's about Eren\n\n* Ah, here's some food for thought. Promotions? Within the titan ranks, or perhaps back with the soldiery? Either by somehow tricking unaware commanders or by a corrupt section\n\n* Reiner's acting weird again. Could it be that he really doesn't want to be thought of as the Armoured Titan and is trying to reconnect with Ymir and Eren? Then when Reiner is shocked at Eren's outburst, unless he's a great actor, I feel he genuinely doesn't believe he's done anything to betray the trust of his fellow squadmates\n\n* Ah, thanks Bert. So it sounds like Reiner wants to think of himself as a member of the human side (a soldier) and not a tool used, either by his own accord or from higher up) to destroy them (warrior). Massively conflicted. I agree with Ymir when she says 'it's amazing really'. Tension! Development!\n\n* And Eren couldn't stay calm for more than a few minutes. Good try bud\n\n* 'Do you think there's any future for the world' This reveals a heck of a lot about Reiner's motivations\n\n* Krista to be the angel who brings titankind and humankind together\n\n* Well there was no preventing them from seeing the flairs\n\nAlthough this had no action it was still a highly enjoyable episode. We learnt a little of Berthold, implied that he's had to watch Reiner, about Ymir who is largely unaware of titan and shifter \"lore\", and most of all Reiner who's massively conflicted. What he says to Ymir 'you also think the world has no future' is a massive clue to what he's doing. If you can't beat 'em, join em. \n\nThis time last season was where we met Levi for the first time and he put on a showcase. Unfortunatly he was too late to save his subordinate. I liked how it established he hated getting dirty, yet he still gripped the guy's bloody hand to comfort him. \n\nChilling abnormal titan: 'I just want a safe lazy life in the titan interior.'\n"

Reiner and Berthold are not only the ones that caused the beginning of the fall of humanity, but they're also responsible for the death of his mother. If there's any situation in which he's excused for getting emotional, this is the one. If anything, Ymir is the strange one for being so calm.\n\nYou also have to take into consideration that everyone's a bit nuts in this series.

I assume they've been brainwashed to be enemies of humanity or sth because that would explain Reiner's...interesting mental state, and Ymir would've flown before being completely brainwashed, or maybe she just realized what they told her was bullshit. This would be the reason she has titan powers, obviously, and why she lived on the streets and had to steal in order to sustain herself but most importantly, this'd be the reason why she seems to have always known how to use her powers, which obviously didn't happen with Eren but apparently Reiner&co have known how to for a long time, at the very least since they were twelve, but assuming more since they had to be trained and whatnot.\n\nI'm digressing a bit but anyway, I'm sure Ymir is keeping some more secrets for us and that'll probably cause a dillema for her, specially seeing that Reiner has offered her safety for her beloved Krista, but she knows what kind of shit she'd be tolerating if she accepted. This knowledge would be the explaination behind her cryptic lines in today's episode and her unwillingness to tell Eren anything"
