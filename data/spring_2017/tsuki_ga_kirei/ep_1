Never before has watching line messages and still pictures moved me and made me go screaming about two lovebirds growing up and getting married. (Of course, the ending theme was great too and set the mood perfectly for me)\nThis might not be the popular opinion here, but I enjoyed how the ending was not animated. The line messages were enough to fill me for each drawing and it was able to jump between moments of their lives without feeling awkward (I would imagine itll be if it were animated). So glad it became a happy and conclusive ending! \nHope to never forget this amazing series!"

I would have loved to see what happens in college or how they adjust to life as full adults with jobs and responsibilities. And it would have given us many, many more of the after credit shorts.\n\nThey could use season 2 to expand on some of the after credit text conversations at the end or to show us how they handle being parents but it feels like this is the end for the show and it is satisfying but it precludes us from getting more without meddling with it.

But we're not letting the viewers off the hook so easily\")\n\nI had to watch the raw because I just wouldn't take the delay this time. God lord, even though I couldn't completely understand the events until the after events ocurred, I was in tears when I understood Koutaro didn't make it to Daichi's entrance.\n\nI'm glad everything worked out at the end for everyone, and that includes Chinatsu that she was able to tell Koutaro how she felt all this time and got properly rejected.\n\nThere was some subtle simbolysm in this episode that would be nice to talk about. Like the [two leaves](http://imgur.com/a5PMNBb.jpg) drifting appart when koutaro tells Akane he didn't pass the Koumei entrance exam foreshadowing their separation. And also the scene at the river were the [river itself](http://imgur.com/K8Zkjd5.jpg) is separating the two love birds appart representing both the long distance relationship they try to work out and also the insecurities and anxiety Akane suffers from.\n\nThat break up by the river has to be one of the most painful ones I've seen in recent years. Akane's VA knows how to express that deep sorrow her character goes thru, and along with the music and animation, it's downright heart breaking.\n\nThe last part with Koutaro writting his and her story in a Novel message board was pure brilliance. Not only it gives him his edge back about his writting skills, but also demonstrates that he won't quit on Akane that easily. \n\nThe part were he runs out to meet Akane at the train station, wheter it's cliched, it's incredibly nicely orchestrated giving a twist to the last minute hold up. That part when even ending theme makes a pause for him to shout out \"I love you\" left me breathless with a knot in my throat.\n\nI'm guessing u/AmethystItalian was jumping around like I did with this kind of ending going all the way to marriage town.\n\n[**They did it**](#slightoverreaction)\n\nI thought LWA brought up the best closure for this season. But I was wrong, obviously Tsuki ga Kirei did.\n\nEdit: [Mandatory](http://i.imgur.com/jk3esLp.png)\n\ncourtesy of u/Mage_of_Shadows"

   "text": "I didn't start the season with it, either, but I'm glad I picked it up in time to catch the conclusion.\n\nI think part of that chemistry you mentioned came from the fact that they're a tad younger than the traditional romance protagonists. It makes all of these difficulties just that much more believable, since not only were these their first experiences with dating and such (as they said), but also they're just arriving at the point where they even start to consider long-term relationships in their lives. You may not be considering marriage that early, but that end-of-middle-school/start-of-high-school period really is the time where you start thinking, \"I could be with this person for a while.\"\n\nAzumi's willingness to take everything all of the burdens in the relationship onto himself reminds me a bit of myself when I was younger. And while that may seem romantic to some, that is certainly not the way to go about things and I'm glad Akane took issue with that.\n\nI'm also happy that they revealed (not so surprisingly) that the end-of-episode text messages between characters were all between Azumi and Akane. It was implied to a degree but them outright stating it with accompanying artwork of their relationship developing was something I wanted. They could have just left them open-ended for interpretation, and I'm glad they gave a definitive answer.\n\nNow to sleep... I stayed up until 9 AM for this and it was supposed to air almost 14 hours ago. I went through all of Grimoire of Zero while waiting for this episode!"

I guess we should start with the obvious:\n\n#[THEY ACTUALLY GOT MARRIED!](http://i.imgur.com/DNcqtyX.png)\n\n[](#akyuusqueel)\n\nseeing that end screen never made me feel like a heavy burden was finally lifted off my back. I don't have to worry about them since \n they're married and even has a kid and are probably living a happy life. Seriously guys, I can't remember the last time I cared so much about a fictional couple. I've never felt so happy and relieved in my life!\n\nAnyway Akane had the right to get mad at Kotarou for not telling her what happened. He got mad at her for hanging out with a guy without telling him so it's just reasonable that she does the same. It's actually **worse** for Akane since we all know she has anxiety issues. She was probably scared and her brain was probably coming up with different reasons on why Kotarou didn't tell her. Anxiety is a bitch and I definitely understand why Akane did what she did.\n\nAs for Kotarou though I guess he was just to dumbstruck with what happened he wasn't able to say anything. He probably thinks it wasn't suppose to be a big deal, which is funny because Akane didn't think that Takumi confessing to her was a big deal. I wished he at least tried to run after her or something. He probably  thought that she was so upset that anything he'd say would make things worse. Still a bad move for Kotarou for just standing there doing nothing.\n\nIn the end though they made up and it's all thanks to Daisuke for showing Kotarou the comments on his novel and (surprisingly) Chinatsu for showing Akane Kotarou's novel.  While it's awesome that they made up I would've loved to see what happened but knowing the show, the night Akane moved and arrived at her new home she probably texted Kotarou or Kotarou probably texted her and apologized to each other.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n**Final Verdict:**\n\nI guess that's it for the most grounded, sweetest, and the most anxiety driven show this season. There were a lot of hiccups with the production but Studio Feel managed to wrap it all up nicely. \n\nI love everything about this show. The art was superb and the character designs while they aren't that unique the style used (I don't know how to call it really) worked well for the show. The music was just gorgeous, I've said this multiple times before but the sound design for this show was amazing, they made everything feel alive even during the silent moments. The sound of crowds, the rustling of trees, the instruments used during the festival. And my god the soundtrack! It's just amazing.\n\nAnd let's not forget the voice actors! I can't remeber the last time I've heard a voice in an anime that felt like a natural human interaction. Seriously, not just the main characters but every side character in this show made an effort to make their characters sound as realistic as possible. You can definitely tell a lot of love was put in to this show.\n\nI'd love to gush some more but I'm currently at work (lol) so for my final verdict for this show: It's definitely a **10/10**. If someone asks me to a recommend them a romance anime I'll definitely recommend this show. Both to long time anime viewers and to newcomers. "

It isn't like he even knew what had been going on between her and Akane or that Akane already knew about her feelings.

Anxiety is a bitch and I definitely understand why Akane did what she did.\n\nTrue. She was already quite a bit anxious about the fact that she will be moving away because even though she had her mind set on maintaining a long distance relationship with Koutarou, deep down she was also aware of its downsides, what with her sister repeatedly warning her of how long distance relationships tend to eventually fail (her sister wasn't wrong and did have a fair point though). Her knowledge of Chinatsu and Koutarou landing up together in the same high school, coupled with Chinatsu having confessed to Koutarou, must have further added to her anxiety. She must have felt very insecure, imagining the worst-case but a likely scenario where the lack of physical proximity between her and Kotarou would make the latter grow indifferent towards her over the course of time while bringing him and Chinatsu closer. Then, the fact that Koutarou didn't think Chinatsu's confession to him was worth mentioning to her at all was the final straw that caused her to break down. \n\n> In the end though they made up and it's all thanks to Daisuke for showing Kotarou the comments on his novel and *(surprisingly) Chinatsu for showing Akane Kotarou's novel.* \n\nI actually didn't find Chinatsu's action to be even a least bit surprising there. In the scheme of things, Chinatsu was as clueless, confused and inexperienced regarding love and romance as Akane and Koutarou. She decided to confess despite knowing that she'd most likely be turned down. At the same time, she cared a great deal about her friendship with Akane and was scared of putting that friendship in jeopardy because of her feelings. She was never consciously antagonistic towards Akane through all of this and tried to uphold their friendship as best as she could. In the end, showing Koutarou's novel to Akane was the least she could do as a friend. "

Kotarou wasn't there to see Akane off on moving day, so Chinatsu most likely picked on the fact that their relationship might be unstable after all. \n\nHowever, Chinatsu still showed Kotarou's story to Akane, which led to the remediation of their relationship. Had Chinatsu not done that, Kotarou would probably be too shy to show his story to Akane, and their relationship might have deteriorated from then on out without that last spark to re-ignite it. Who knows, our main couple might have eventually broke up and Chinatsu might be able to end up with Kotarou. Still, Chinatsu decided that she cares more about her friend and gave Akane that final push to reaffirm her feelings. \n"

Then everything stops and Kotarou bursts out with \"I LOVE YOU\". It was just a single line, but man the execution of it was perfect. I've never felt so much admiration and emotion from it (my crappy vocab cannot express how i felt watching this scene, it was just that beautiful... everything came into place for that moment and I was already crying through the episode... its too much). Kotarou, someone who is quite reserved and introverted, screaming of how he truly felt was so awe inspiring to me. So many things I've felt from watching this show that I've never felt from any other animes out there. I'm giving this 10/10 and making this AOTS to my favourite anime!!!\n\nAnd I saw that too! How he looked to be in pain from running and takes out his phone, thinking he can take it easy and message through LINE. But it just isnt enough. Words on the screen cannot express how you really and truly feel. You have to say it in person or you will never get the message across. Even if you have to scream it in a hopeless situation. A person's voice carries their true inner feelings way better then just letters tossed together on a phone. Fkn Kotarou being the man here!!!!\n\n-Long reply but I cannot just hold it in. Sorry!"

From Kotarou's thoughtful \"hm\"s and looks at the ceiling, pondering Daisuke's advice, to Akane's radiant smiles and adorable interactions with her older sister, how could I NOT smile? Even if I were to criminally deny the rest of the cast their well deserved credit for making this show what it is, Tsuki ga Kirei would still be a beautiful and innocent romance that will gladly earn my recommendation each time.\n\nBut I'm not a monster to toss this show aside once finished without mentioning all the characters I liked, so let's appreciate Daisuke's aid to our inexperienced couple, Chinatsu and Hira's cheerfulness through expected, yet still bitter rejection, Kotarou mom's controlling, but still loving nature and Kotarou dad's seeming impartiality that's hiding a wall of support and understanding. Ayane's caring advice, Mizuno parents' compassion for their daughters, the class mates' lovable \"yup, they're middle schoolers\" talks and antics and last, but definitely not least, pink potato's irresistible squishiness. ^^^squish ^^^squish\n\nI didn't think the show would make me cry and, until the very end, it didn't. Even throughout the montage I was smiling, but when they showed the picture Kotarou, Akane, the grandparents and the child, which finally felt like a nice conclusion, I couldn't help it.

I got [more](http://imgur.com/IcNIkjq) and [more](http://imgur.com/gvRrjLi) desperate, to the point of almost [getting my pitchfork](http://imgur.com/BmdCtaP) \n\nand then [she reads his story](http://imgur.com/64DTQaB) and she's got her [plushie](http://imgur.com/PtU06ck).\n-\n[Making me not knowing what to expect and think anymore...](http://imgur.com/tKLbjbi)\n-\nThen the [texts came to ease me up](http://imgur.com/a/knbVC)...the texts that confirmed what some were saying, that Akane and Kotarou were the ones sending the ending texts. The texts that confirmed that studio feel was, in fact, feeding us spoilers since the very first episode ([read them here](https://brownricecookies.wordpress.com/), and thank you for translating all these)\n\nAll this lead to me shed tears of happiness at seeing thay they've actually [got married](https://i.imgur.com/7FaPrR8.jpg) and [had a child](https://imgur.com/SXzBlEt). (I'm in my mid 20s and ended up tearing at seeing the ending)\n\n[](#akkotears) [](#yuitears) [](#manly-tears) [](#toradorasalute)\n\n---\n\nThe show was spectacular, way, way more than what I've expected. It gave us diabetes from the very begining. And I think [this is mandatory](http://imgur.com/ssMAJPl) (updated after knowing we're not getting the shinkai ending). \n\nOf course it doesn't go without problems, the delays were unbarable and some of the 3D animation was horrible but it sure deserves a top spot for this season, and maybe the entire year.\n\nWith a better animation, it would have easly gotten **AOTS**. I'm glad that I've picked it up when it first aired and didn't dropped it (as I was initially expecting to do). \n\nMy **score** is **87/100**, 9/10 converted for MAL. But in all due honesty, **don't look at the score, just watch the anime if you haven't** and you like this genre.\n\n---\n\nEdit: fixed some mistakes."

   "text": "Those phone conversations in the ED each episode turned out to really be Azumi and Akane after all - as someone who found the translations a few episodes back and started reading them with each new episode, that made the ending even more powerful for me. It's so nice that it was a happy ending after all too - with all the speculation, I was convinced it wasn't going to go well. These types of shows, when done well, really have a tendency to get you attached to the main characters, and Tsuki ga Kirei really hit that nail on the head, making every twist and turn in their relationship emotionally gripping without feeling contrived. 10/10, AOTS, and an absolute must-watch for any fan of romance anime."

   "text": "Amazing finale to an overall great show. I was definitely on the edge of my seat throughout the episode. \n\nThe whole last few minutes were just incredible. Akane reading Kotarou's story while he was running after the train was lovely. I was a little worried at the start of Kotarou's monologue that we were about to get a Shinkai ending but the credits after the ending fortunately cleared that up =)\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed this show. I wasn't totally sold on Akane and Kotarou as a couple at first but the later episodes did a good job of building up their relationship and making it believable. For a show about middle schoolers, the romance to me felt pretty grounded in reality and far more mature than other shows where the MC's are in high school or beyond. It's a shame though that we didn't get to see what happened to any of the other characters (seriously, Roman and Sensei route when?)."

Once I get caught up, it'll happen a lot more regularly. :3\n\nThis scenario occurs when I happen to watch up to the eleventh episode of a show during the season. I made it that far, so I may as well complete it, right?\n\nTruth be told, I did this for Masamune-kun's Revenge in Winter. I needed to know what was going to happen. Same for TgK. I couldn't wait months to see the conclusion to this heartfelt romance tale.\n\nMasamune-kun ended disappointingly, but, thankfully, TgK more than delivered. :D"

I wasn't sure if Kotarou was gonna let it all slip away like that. Like, damn boy, why the hell are you still at dance practice when your girl's about to leave? And didn't that festival pass already, why are you still doing this right now?? It didn't help that Akane got on the train and left just like that - I think that gave many people Shinkai flashbacks. When Kotarou was running after the train and shouting his love for Akane, I was about to give up and just accept it, like, yeah, okay, this is how it ends. Bittersweet, I guess. \n\n~And then~\n\nAnd then they showed all their messages, and all was right in the world again. That last picture was pure joy. This is legitimately one of the most wholesome romance animes I've ever seen. Too many of them have the same tropes with the dense MCs, harems, tsunderes, fanservice moments, inconclusive LN endings and other nonsense, but this show had none of that. It avoided the cliches and gave a story as honest and relatable as can be. What a ride. 10/10"

It broke so many romance conventions by having the characters deal with their problems like actual human beings; actually making a long-distance relationship work, heck showing them what happened throughout their life!  That's something so rare in romance anime nowadays, showing a couple's love life after high school.

They don't know anything about love, or how to be in love, so everything they do they do fresh and with each other. When you know too much about something certain societal expectations sets in, and those expectations can threaten to mold one's relationship. So then when something comes along to challenge those relationships, such as being long distance, other couples might give up and conform to things that's supposed to happen like \"long distance relationships don't work and you're going to break up\". But these two, they're just dumb enough, and sincere enough, to actually try and make things work. "

   "text": "I've written about it a bit over on Mal - but the series was fantastic.  A concern I saw voiced that I hope becomes a thing was one poster said they hope Tsuki ga Kirei doesn't become the next \"hated because it got popular\" anime.  Why do I hope?  Because the anime was fantastic in a lot of technical areas too and I love defending something that is so easily defensible. \n\nThe really great thing about it is that on a technical level - with shot compositions, pacing, writing and character development - the anime is practically feature film quality.  It's weakest part is definitely animation, but only during the CG parts - they are trying to develop a way to achieve more with less manpower - but haven't gotten there yet.\n\nIt's the biggest glaring problem in the anime but I'll happily take that as part of the meal if it means we got what we got everywhere else.\n\nI only have 1 10 at the moment on MAL (Akira) - Cowboy bebop might also get bumped up to a 10 - .   If this didn't have the animation issues (CG, walk cycles) this would probably have been a 10.  I'm conflicted with the idea of whether I want anime to \"rush to produce\" romance stories that actually progress faster than the heat death of the universe or not.  I'll admit about a third of the enjoyment I got out of the anime is that it surprised me time and again when it broke \"anime romance\" conventions.\n\nAnd a shout out to Kotarou for not just confronting the track team club captain and lead Akane away by hand, that alone made him awesome - but he stared him down and held the stare well beyond any mistaking it for anything else - that's what made him a bad ass.  My favorite single scene among a ton of favorite scenes in the series.  It wasn't the confrontation and leading away - next time you re-watch just see how long he holds the stare against the guy much bigger than him and more physically fit.  That's why she feels safe with him.\n\n\"Best of last season\" is a severe understatement.  It's got to be one of the top 5 best romance anime of all time."

   "text": "What a beautifully bittersweet finale that exceeded any and all expectations. I could have never imagined them handling the long distance part this incredibly well, and that final scene with Akane on the train was absolutely gorgeous. If only every romance Anime could progress and conclude as well as this one did. I could not have wished, hoped or dreamed of a finale better than this one.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nTsuki ga Kirei is a beautiful show about the most ordinary of things. It's one that I can safely put alongside Fune wo Amu and Usagi Drop as something that I can call 'overwhelming beauty in  beautiful simplicity'. It's a great standard for what romance Anime *should* be, contrary to what it usually is. The chemistry between the main couple and the growth they made was handled to perfection and despite the sometimes lacking visuals the show was full of feeling and atmosphere. Tsuki ga Kirei ranks in at a **Low 9/10**, as my undoubted **AOTS**. "

And when the credit rolled, [Spoiler](/s \"It showed that Azumi-kun and Akane-chan worked hard to keep their relationship hanging, along with their LINE chat - yes! The LINE chat at the end, while may not directly from the both of them, were so close to how they would chat to each other, and after a while they happily reunited together, revealing their relationship to each family and, eventually, getting married and even having a child too!\"). If it wasn't midnight where I live I would literally scream and squeal like a fucking pig\n\nIn their picture at the end, it showed not only their ring finger wearing ring but also a red string on each other's pinky too. I guess fate really do brought them together.\n\nThe name of the anime is Tsuki ga Kirei (or As the moon, so beautiful). But ironically, Studio Feel shows us a relationship between a boy and a girl that is even more beautiful than the moon itself. And the ending, oh my goodness, it's perfection, it's art, it's the most beautiful thing a romance series could show us\n\nDefinitely AOTS or AOTY material, a must-watch for romance suckers\n\n9/10, if the animation was better it would be an easy 10/10"

Or have an actual scene in the future. They're never shown to meet face to face between her running away and the train departure, and after that it's all dreamlike images.\nI feel like the epilogue isn't 100% earned, so it wasn't as satisfying as I needed it to be. Of course, I only state how things feel to me, and me only. I completely understand everyone else, who got what they needed out of it.

It felt real and gave the dramitic moment a certain levity to not step into the realm of melodrama. \n\nThe texts at the end which show what they went through was also great as it wasn't just sunshine and rainbows, they went through the natural worries and issues that a long distance relationship creates, but they got through it and the beautiful flow of the episode is topped off which what we all wanted to see. \n\nSo happy with this show and the narrative choices made from start to finish.

You're lucky you have teenage immaturity on your side, otherwise you'd be my Worst Girl of Season instead of Shikimi.\n\nHowever, the ending more than made up for it. It's exactly the one that I hoped it would be, and holy shit was it glorious. Fitting that they left the best ending for the season for the very last day before Summer starts tomorrow. I picked Tsuki ga Kirei as my AotS even before the last episode and this episode justified my faith in it.\n\nI feel so blessed to have watched this incredible show. I'm going to keep this as a contender for Anime of the Year. Easily a 10/10 show for me and will raise the bar for future romance anime by a huge margin.\n\nI wonder if Roman and Ryoko-sensei managed to hook up in the end?"

Those ending scenes with the texts truly showed us the importance of them in the show. Usually texts are used for ease of communication but in Tsuki ga Kirei they became a vital part. Their voices became characters and the characters came to life due to this.\n\nI loved how everything came down to writing. Had Azumi given up writing he wouldn't have reached Akane and in the end they may have failed their relationship. Writing was a constant theme throughout the show with quotes appearing left right and centre and Azumi failing his dream career. The train scene where Akane was reading it as Azumi screaming that he loved her was possibly one of the scenes of the season and definitely scenes of the show (I haven't watched much this season, although [Boku no Hero S2](/s \"Uraraka vs. Bakugo was up there too.\") Overall I really feel (no pun intended) that this show although being a bit of an underdog this season became the highlight of the year so far for me.\n\nI'm blabbering and struggling to get my opinions out, but if this had source material I'd read it. Everything about the show was great (maybe the light reflecting off the character could do with some work) and despite hating him when he confessed I came out liking Hira, and not having a reason to dislike any character at all. \n\n[**I want more Azuno!**Why is it over?](#akkotears)"

My AOTS and even if in reality it had the quality of 9/10, I'm giving it a big fat 10. Solved misunderstandings within the same episode, managed a complete and heartwarming romance, and gave us unbelievable insight into two of the most quiet characters all in a single cour.\n\nI could write so much more but when it comes down to it, I will *never* forget this anime. I will never stop recommending and I'm so happy you guys watched along.\n\nAmazing."

The characters actually felt like real people, and several times I related to not just the leads, but even the side characters. The art was fantastic, and while the animation didn't always quite do it justice, it accomplished what it needed to even at its worst; and at its best, delivered some utterly beautiful scenes. The VA's brought the script to its fullest potential, and the music ranged from \"nice\" to \"oh my gosh this is perfect usage i'm not crying you're crying.\"\n\nShingeki no Kyojin was what I thought was going to be my favorite this season, but Tsuki ga Kirei gets a **10/10** and my AotS award."

It's a bit sad that Kota didn't become an author at the end (he might still be doing it part-time, who knows), but I'm glad he decided to work to support Akane both before and after marriage.\n\n\nThe train scene at the end has got to be one of my favorite scenes ever, Akane reading the update, Kota screaming at the top of his lungs, just perfect.\n\n\nAnd that goddamn ED montage <3 I'm glad the ED Line messages were theirs after all. At the start of the anime I'd just said on a whim that the perfect ending would be them getting married and have a kid but holy fuck, it actually happened.\n\n\n**My Score: A Perfect 10/10 would get anxiety again**"

I wish they had more scenes where they play off each other but I don't think it harms the series too badly. Even though their interactions aren't that well done, they each have a good idea of how they should behave with each other, like when Kotarou goes to Akane's track meet and tells her afterwords. Like Akane says, she feels safe with Kotarou. \n\n> Maybe if there had ever been any real sort of internal conflict between the two like a real relationship inevitably has rather than just the rather weak drama of the other characters or the few cases of Kotaro being an idiot.\n\nYeah, i pretty much disagree with this. The show is about two awkward and shy kids in their first relationship where they basically don't know how to go about it. They behave awkwardly around each other a lot and they don't know how to go about their relationship. There's several points where their shyness is a hindrance to their relationship and they have to overcome it to solve a problem, like at the theme park or during the school trip. Their lack of experience also hurts each other or just has them not knowing what to do like when they google/yahoo relationship advice or get jealous of Chinatsu or Hira."
