When Yoshino offered the backup acting role to her, it obviously struck a raw nerve. \n\n- Again, like Yoshino's unsuccessful job search, Maki being forced to abandon her dream hits very close to home for me.\n\n- There's also the subplot of Shiori resorting to lying to prevent that derelict house to be burned down for the film set, suggesting the \"haunted\" house has some sentimental value to her.\n\n- Trivia - Hibiki Euphonium and Re:Zero voice actor connection:\n\n>Kumiko (Erika, the scowling cafe kid) has a cute crush on Reina's (Maki's) little brother Subaru (Kousuke).

Even if Maki loves acting, she simply didn't put enough effort in what she was doing. Can Maki even claim she liked the job? Even her kouhai with wonderful name Moe got ahead of her - she had more passion for her job (I don't think roasty cicadas are that awful btw). Maki has taken a break and almost given up - no wonder Sanae, who had some reflection in past episodes, tries to bring her back on track. \n\nReal hero of the episode is an assistant director who is [kinda zombie](http://i.imgur.com/EqXa2xT.jpg). Life of a person who loves his job, even if that love is unrequited. \n\nEntire plot with filming reminded of Hanasaku Iroha which had a similar arc with another eccentric director. I hope this time it won't be a disaster. \n\nMotives of Shiori left me puzzled, however. Even after getting [permission](http://i.imgur.com/GcXvHgn.png) to burn the house, she lied about it. I can only guess she, native of the village, doesn't want it to be destroyed for some crappy movie. I can understand her, but at the same time Shiori didn't look like a person who would hide something behind her back, especially when her friends need help. \n"

What I found disturbing thought is that they already know she had a problem working with this project with her [walking out at the beginning](http://i.imgur.com/xNoVsKA.png) when the Chief was asking her to be a stage hand. For some reason Yoshino forgot that and [still went ahead and volunteered to have her cover for the injured actress.](http://i.imgur.com/iMCdPiF.png)\n\n[I love how they referenced Japan's crazy late night shows.](http://i.imgur.com/ftjIXXI.png) I've seen plenty of those and you do see a lot of no name actors and actresses do weird stuff there, I guess cicadas were just too much for Maki to handle. And just because of that small event she ended up thinking she doesn't have what it takes to survive in the 'biz. I really hope [best girl Sanae's words](http://i.imgur.com/6QkEeu4.png) was enough to push her. If not I hope she slaps some common sense back into her.\n\nAnd I guess to some extent this will also be about Shiori. Judging by the people she visited in the city she knows the person who owns that house. And looking on how torn she is about this it looks like it's the home of someone special to her. Old boyfriend perhaps? Nah, as if there'll be a relationship arc in this show. Seriously though I'm pretty curious on what';s up with Shiori."
