Although that makes me think that she might not say yes. Even though she seems to like him, I wouldn't be surprised if the track guy already asked her out and she reluctantly agreed. If she does say yes, it's always great to see a romance anime focus on an already established relationship than the building up to one. Either way, I'm excited to see where this goes."

This guy was able to confess faster than most romance anime and he's still too late? Damn.\n\nI don't think she would accept though since the scene with her in Wcdonalds (or whatever fast-food joint) clearly showed that he was still definitely on her mind so if Hira did confess, I'm pretty sure she would not be in the mindset to just say yes.\n\nPlus it would be weird to think that after she got confessed to she'd still feel like going to the shrine."

It's only episode 3 but this show never fails to give me butterflies. I am so in love with it! \n\nThe hesitations Kotarou gets before sending texting Akane and that little panic when Akane hasn't texted her yet about the meet, this show just keeps on hitting marks on what it's like to be a normal teenager in love. It's just so goddam relatable! \n\nALSO, [a normal family dinner!](http://imgur.com/a/3B7ay) I can't even remember the last time I saw a scene like this in an SoL! We even see the parents have an active role in the Kotarou and Akane's lives and not just people behind the scenes! It's all soo good!\n\nNo shorts at the end though! I hope we get some next week!"

   "text": "Definitely my pick for anime of the season that is not named LWA.\n\nI'm so very impressed by how this show uses non-verbal communication to convey a character's state of mind, saying so much without saying much of anything at all.\n\nWhat's more, through entirely realistic dialogue and situations, the show is incredibly effective at putting the audience in the mindset of the teenagers in question, probably even better than some shows that are masters at that including Flowers of Evil and Toradora.\n\nCouple that with a beautiful art style and some solid directing work and this is a functionally perfect slice of life. It's a mirror held up to our teenage lives, and not a dirty or deformed one either.\n\nI actually go shot by shot on one of the scenes in question from episode 1 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mN4Foio9aTY) and you can find all the evidence for my points about nonverbal conveyance, directing and realism there. After three episodes, it looks like the whole show's like this! It's amazing.\n\nMany people in the /r/TrueAnime Discord mocked it for being \"just a diner scene\" in a \"simple anime\" and believed that there's no skill to the craft in this show. I'll tell you right now that very, very few shows operate on the same level of character expression and directing efficacy of this show. I've watched most of the season so far, and to overlook this one would be a huge mistake. "

Even before I trekked over here to see what the convo had been I was saying to myself, \"now this is good writing/direction.\" Telling instead of showing is a complaint I have with a ton of otherwise excellent shows and I always appreciate when anime put a bit of trust in me the viewer to understand what's going on without overtly explaining it. Excellent show so far. Hope I can catch up on time to be live for the Ep 12 discussion, and I've subscribed to your channel! Maybe we can chat on cinematography/animation/direction in anime someday [graphic design background but I fancy myself enough of a general art buff to comment.]   \n\nEdit: I agree, if I understand what you're getting at, that Toradora was also exemplary in this regard. One of my all-time fave anime, and I often gush to friends about how good the writing is."

You would them approach the hall, bow twice, clap twice, then bow once.  You would pass the torii again on your way out.  \n\nWhat came across to me was Kouta was just usually proper about his entire prayer.  Most people don't bow when they cross the torii, usually you just purify the hands and skip the month or some people may purify the mouth, but not take such care to use the left hand or repurify the left hand.  It's also common for people to skip the initial two bows and jump to clapping.  Also when he clapped the way he adjusted his hands before clapping is something you usually only do in groups to clap in sync or something, not just when you are making a casual visit.  \n\nEdit: Looked it up and it is also apparently proper to draw the right hand back before clapping and then to realign the hands.\n\nI think we're supposed to take away that Kouta is really invested in her sprint time...because she is."

That's why she has a bit of a delayed response - it sounds like he's just saying something else about the moon. \n\nWe are meant to assume that his previous line, where he just says \"the moon\" was not meant to be \"the moon\" after all, but the start of \"go out with me\". But he stutters, she misunderstands, and then cuts him off to say that, yeah, the moon sure is pretty.\n\nI was about to be disappointed that his confession was going to end in a dumb misunderstanding, as per usual, and this was going to drag on for the rest of the season, but he actually clears up the misunderstanding immediately, as done by no anime protagonists ever :P"

I think everyone who's had a crush in their lives would be able to relate to that: you want to convey your interest, but at the same time you're worried about coming on too strong and scaring the other person away.\n\nAdd to that some great pacing, natural voice acting, and strong visuals, and Tsuki ga Kirei is one of the better series this season.

They wanna build more to this relationship I think and its fine, but omg he asked her out!!!     \n\n[But this anime](http://imgur.com/a/6qYGf) is taking me back to early high school so hard.  \n[Like c'mon... could you be anymore real.](http://imgur.com/a/ykIXu)  I don't think so. They've done a perfect job at capturing these emotions.   \n[Here's another one in case you think I'm lying](http://imgur.com/a/1fCug)   \n\nOut of all the shows this season, this is the one I [least expected a cliff hanger from](http://imgur.com/a/BQejL) at least this early... Man... Confession ish in episode three... What are we Toradora?  \n\nSo I'm in. I'm completely into this now. I don't care what shit they are going to pull to try and break up the best ship I've ever seen in a long time, but I'm in. I want these two to be happy together. I want this ending on a happy note for both.   \nthat ass hat on the track team can bugger off ,we don't need him. He can go date her friend or something. I don't want anyone else together except these two... And a part of me feels that might not happen for a while :'(    \n\nEdit; I also want to point out just how real everything feels. Akane and Kotarou feel so real. They have realistic and relatable emotions. They are dealing with things how normal 13 year olds would, not very well. The families so far have felt perfect. No one is extra mean because they need to be, Akane's sister is perfect and feels just natural with the jabs they take. Nothing about the families or the way they act with each other/while texting feels wrong. It feels like they are real kids. And that's something that is apparently hard to pull off because a lot of us are mentioning just how natural it all feels.   \nI love this anime. "

Sighing while reading the names of the winners of the young-author competition, dismay at a phone dying at quite the inopportune time. More showing and less telling is adding extra weight and nuance to the scenes, elevating our connection to them.\n\nThe anime probably didn't need to replay earlier scenes as part of a couple of flashbacks, and the super-convenient cutoff confession from Hira is unfortunately unnatural (especially when so much of the rest of the show isn't). Regardless, I'm really liking this one.\n\nTgK being a cute, lovable romance also helps. :3"

Oh god it's highschool all over gain and I don't want to remember what I went through. 2nd half was nice though, the moonlit scene got me all warm and fluffy inside. Dat pun tho, or is it a segue. *Smooth*\n\nBtw, for those curious or have taken a liking to the OP song here's a [short PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGHRRdMWSIw) sung by Touyama Nao who voices the Teacher that Pretty Boy has a crush on."

   "text": "That cliffhanger ending leaves me very worried. This show has set my expectations pretty high by having Kotaro ask her out already - the last thing I want is for this show to backpedal over its progress. I'm less interested in seeing a \"will they, won't they?\" romance than I am in seeing two young characters actually progress through a relationship - even if it's a slow-moving one.\n\nAlso, the detail put into the animation of that entire scene was great. I loved all the minor expressions and movements."

But since there's still a lot more episodes, I guess we're gonna be seeing more drama down the road. I hope not though...I really like the chill and innocent atmosphere the show's been building. I really hope it doesn't go the 5cm/s route. These kids deserve their happiness!"

She smiles when she got nice texts from him but unlike the MC, she wasn't acting giddy over them.\n\nI mean, I'm convinced they get together eventually.. but I wouldn't be surprised if maybe she's just interested in just being friends.. and then throughout the episodes she realizes she does have feelings "

   "text": "Kind of late but here we go. So back in the meiji era there was a famous novelist who was translating english and he used the moon is beautiful tonight as the translation for I love you. To give some context, in most east asian cultures especially in Japan you don't really show intimacy espcially in public. Physical intimicy like hugs and saying things like I love you are big nono's even between family members. Now go back 100 something years and that's the sort of culture that this guy was translating these works for. As for moon tsuki and like suki, they're written differently but sound similar from what I understand."

And even if it's not meant to be poignant or somber, it still manages to convey those feelings, while also validating them for some nice gratification.\n\nIt's fluffy to the max.
