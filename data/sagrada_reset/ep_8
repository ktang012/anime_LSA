I'm assuming he has free range of his actions when he enters though. Maybe he can only relive it exactly as the event plays out. If that's the case it would useful in solving some crimes, but the timing would be hard to pull off. Though I wonder what if someone gets murdered on a camera and he takes a screenshot or freeze frame of it. Would that qualify? I'm really interested in his ability.

   "text": "This show is extremely frustrating by virtue of the reversed dramatic irony, wherein the characters know everything but we know nothing.\n\nTimeskips are handled in a way that makes it discern what, if anything, is going on, and seemingly at random. Why was it important that marble girl occurred prior to Murase, for example? And if it was, why show after Murase?\n\nKei's talked a couple times about having made a \"selfish request\" to the Bureau after Blondie's death. My guess is that, like Murase, he decided he wanted to destroy the Bureau and he and Haruki started doing things to make life more difficult for them.\n\nThat would also explain why Haruki has become a bit more emotive, since doing things that she thought were wrong, but Kei told her were for the greater good, might force her to think for herself? Maybe?\n\nAnyway, by 6 episodes in I'm invested and I'm not going to drop the thing, I just hope it goes somewhere."
