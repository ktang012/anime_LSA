But I don't see how it is against the thread's rules since the rules state that you shouldn't spoil the anime based on its SOURCE MATERIAL. And Rage of Bahamut VIRGIN SOUL is a PRIMARY SOURCE of the story it is telling. The topic at hand on this thread is the source material itself. Otherwise we aren't allowed to be talking about this series at all to begin with. Yes it is from a mobile game, but it has its OWN story and its story is NOT an adaptation from another medium. It would be another case if this anime was the cancelled Rage of Bahamut Manaria Friends, which was based on a story event from the mobile game. But VIRGIN SOUL isn't. Also it can't be a spoiler if the promotional material on this series already spoils it to you to begin with. If anything, it's a promotional material on the same (ANIME) medium. Not a LN, VN, manga, etc... It's like saying that the trailers itself is the source material (which is dumb if you say that the trailer is the source material). I'd even add that the trailer is already part of what was shown thus far in the medium because it was already released prior the first episode's release. So I don't see anything wrong bringing up what was shown prior to this episode. It's like saying that we aren't supposed to talk about the previous episodes, because that is spoilers too. Also everything we talk about the series thus far is already spoilers. It's in the title of the thread too. So I can't see why posting about the trailer is breaking the thread's rules...\n\n>I guess me and you where the only two to watch the darn trailers...\n\nI watched it a few times before RoB VS aired because it was the only anime that I was looking forward to watching this season. So the images were quite vivid. So when I saw the angels' giant ring ship in the episode and the falling debris on Anatae, I was reminded of a giant circular thing that crashed and the falling debris scene from the trailer. So after watching the episode I rewatched the trailers again and I realized that the creators have already spoiled for the viewers what's going to happen in episode 13. "

It could have been anything had we brought this topic up before this episode aired. Also we never really connected the dots that the dragon in the trailer was Nina either until the end of episode 1. So I think that the staff didn't show too much overall, well except for the secret weapon and the giant ring ship. The giant ring ship seemed threatening, but if you have already seen the scene where Rita was standing and seeing it crash in trailer 2, it does kill the tension, because the viewer who have seen the trailer would already know that Charioce's weapon will work. How it fucks up because it's still in development remains to be seen."

I don't really see how someone who truly cares for humanity, internally or otherwise, would rule in the way he does and expect it to last very long unless he has a more specific personnel goal in mind we are just unaware of. What will really tip the balance for me in terms of his complexity and ultimately his character as a whole is what the strange new power he has obtained is, where did it come from, and what was the price for it. Obviously the shows title gives away what the source likely is and given what we know about how overwhelming powerful Bahamut was (is?) it'll be interesting to see the details behind said mysterious new power. \n\nThat being said im absolutely loving this season as well, its been a blast from the start and well worth the wait."

This episode only comfirms that she might still love him and she might do something to make her self transform to stop the war. Or she is going to transform by herself (it's almost like he broke a curse on her or something lol) and do something. I hope its not the later because I rather have a more interesting interation. To further this theory there is a very short clip of Charoice standing in front of fire infurno which is Nina in dragon form when you look closely. So yah."

   "text": "I can't really make a prediction, because there is only little to work with what the trailers have shown. Obviously this device has some spells, and it had crystals (which I assume to have mana in them), so I can say that it's not fully sci-fi in nature, despite its look. But it could be a practical application of magic of sorts. \n\nNina turning into a dragon is a given, but so far all we know is that she turns into a dragon when she gets doki doki when she sees a very sexy man. So for that I don't really know how in such a situation that she will turn into a dragon. Side effect of being exposed to a high concentration of magic via crystals? Charioce using magic? Favaro using magic? Rita using magic? I can't say for sure.\n\nBut if I have to make HUGE guess it'd be that Nina and co. will be put in a stressful situation. This in turn will force her to want to protect her fellow escapees, which results in her transformation. (Cliche I know, but that's the best I got from what is given) I mostly got the idea from another work on Cygames, Shadowverse. In Shadowverse, there is a character like Nina in the form of Rowen. Rowen is a character that was cursed to turn into a dragon whenever his desire to protect someone overwhelms him. Although it seems that his and Nina's circumstances behind their transformations are different, I should also add that Shadowverse's story-line is incomplete and all the viewers know about Rowen is that he was a soldier who accidentally killed his squad due to his transformation (he also has trouble recollecting what happened afterwards just like Nina) and that he has a family. Perhaps Cygames is just reusing the same concept about dragon transformation through the anime? After all, they did have Granblue Fantasy which had Jeanne, Amira, Lucifer and Bahamut, so maybe Rowen is half-dragon like Nina as well. I find it hard to pass up, since they are just so similar in that regard. Maybe the cause of her transformation isn't necessarily tied to her libido, but her strong emotions. Maybe stressful situations like Rowen's that makes him want to protect his comrades and family is also an alternative trigger to it."

I kind of hope they save her transforming on her own till the last episodes because it would be cliche. I would rather have be a more interesting situation for her to go dragon but one can only hope. I'll give Mappa credit for at least for shadowing her attempting to transform on her own so when she does do it( which she will) it doesn't come out of no where. My guess that her to transform on her own maybe she has to think of something to make her heart go doki doki for it to work which I would prefer because it goes better with her personality rather than her just sure will power. I won't get mad if she does because whether it's a cliche move it's still Character development but not at it's best or even worse."

They don't seem to be at all benevolent since they have no qualms taking out their anger at Charioce on the entirety of humanity, and give no shits about the way he treats the demons. Fuck em. Bacchus seems to agree as well, since he didn't want to hand El/Mugaro over to them. I can only assume he knew they'd use him as a weapon and completely fuck him up psychologically. Hell, even Sofiel doesn't seem fully on board with all this. But I think the most telling thing of all is that their motivation for going to war wasn't to free the humans and demons from a tyrannical king, but to rest the 'natural order' with them on top and everyone else below them, and to get revenge.

Episode composition-wise though, this was the worst episode I've seen across both seasons.\n\nThroughout the episode, character conversations/interactions felt flat and superficial. The progression of various scenes felt independent of each other and just thrown together hastily - prior episodes had scene progress plot elements or introduce new ones that flow much better. \n\nActions that take in place of a scene were much more realistic in other episodes than in this one. We got a hint of some asspulling last episode with the King kinda just showing up but then taunting Nina for no apparnt reason - but the asspulls in the escape scene was all over the place. How many times did the gang just stop while they're being chased? Can't escape? Giant hole in the right. I fall off the bridge but conveniently this mine cart intercepts my gang and does a BS save from a BS surround. Mine guards on hot pursuit? Brake the cart - they won't crash into you, in fact, they'll dissappear! Escaping and bump into buddies? Well let us *just stop* for our reunion with each other which is even commented by Rita instead of a more realistic (imo) reunion while running.  \n\n\nWhat is with the placement of the ending credits? There was no need to throw the ED when they did and then throw 1:30 minutes behind it. Just keep it contiguous - it would've ended better that ways anyways.\n\nThem reusing character models for the sake of producing a sense of large population makes it better. I can get behind angel clones but when all the female guards are burly ladies wearing makeup.. I'm getting irked. Perhaps it's supposed to relate to the NPCs in the original game?\n\nSorry, I just needed to rant about this episode. I just wanted to get it out there.

So insted The king decided to take it by force. \nHumans couldn't protect them selves against  major threats like Bahamut or even large scale demon armies without the help of the gods. And with the help of the gods they gave little help insted only allowing  literally one person to protect an intire city and if not the all humans.\nIf you rewatch season one you can notice that Micheal was the only arc Angel doing some  thing and shown concern while the other sat around literally being fed grapes while the human city is being attack and Bahamut is about to go on a rampage. Do they try to find the god key or stop Amira them selves? Nope! They are plenty capable of walking around humans as shown during season two with Sophiel looking for El.\nWhat do you guys think?"

   "text": "Sorry let me re fraise that. What I was trying to say is that maybe he wanted some sort of power to protect themselves against large scale attacks. Or at least have some fighting chance if Bahamut where to show up again  and they not have to rely on God's protection. I didn't mean to make it sound like the gods might have a weapon or magic that can take down Bahamut.But if anything we seen they are definitely the strongest out of all three of the beings. I was thinking more on the lines of humans obtaining a more powerful form of magic hence the stuff they have now. But it was also forbidden by the gods that is also something to keep in mind in my theory."
