That's why people, even in the era of Internet and messengers creating an opportunity to talk to anyone, still like the stations.\n\nI also enjoyed how [tensionless](http://i.imgur.com/rsrnfTH.jpg) was Sanae's temporary resignment - apparently characters are mature enough to not freak out and give her some time to figure out her feelings. Some other shows should take notes. \n\nWhen it comes to the project itself, it seems to be rather naive to me - not sure if people would actually care to invest in some palace in the middle of nowhere in the village nobody cares about... Characters so far are full with passion, so I guess will see what happens next.

It wasn't as grand as what Yoshino originally planned but it's a start.\n\nSo Sandal is basically a foreign artist taking his time off in Japan? They can't just drop that info and not do something about it. I hope we get more screentime from him in a future episode!"
