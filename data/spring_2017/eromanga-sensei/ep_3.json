It was nice to see Masamune tell Muramasa thank you for supporting him all these years.  Sadly though, this puts her in \"childhood friend\" territory so that means shes doomed.  \n\nMeanwhile Emily is that \"i just transfered here\" girl who everyone loves and really spices up the story and gets the fans all excited... but that also means shes doomed as well.  \n\nWhy?  Because there is a \"little sister\" in the mix, and once that is there, all other candidates lose.  \n\nAt this point on probably on team muramasa mostly because shes got the most reason to like him.  I usually sympathize with the childhood friend because they often have known the protag a long time and usually there is a deep connection there.  So they often have the most realistic justification.  I know they will lose in the end but i just cant help but root for them.  \n\nThis series remains enjoyable and fun to watch and thats all i really wanted out of it.

Much easier to insult someone than come up with a legitimate reason to hate on people for offering their opinions.\n\nAnd if people did say that comment, that's completely fine. Different opinions are allowed and people like different things. It's what makes anime, and media in general, so great. This thread is about discussion, not just blind praise. And guess what? This is discussion spawned from his comment that somehow offered \"nothing\". Just by responding to it and me proves you're wrong about its addition to the discussion.\n\nBut yes, dismiss me because some of my points are similar to Digi's ideas and comments. It's impossible for more than one person to come to their own conclusions and reach similar ideas on a show. Totally impossible.\n\nNot like this whole discussion post is full of similar praising ideas, but I don't go around the whole discussion hating on people for what they like. I've jumped in to defend someone's right to an opinion, no matter how lengthy or short it is, and have tried to convince you your hatred, however mild, and actions are wrong because as long as someone is having fun watching anime, that's all that matters.\n\nAnd if that fun includes critiquing it, that's just as valid as the vapid praise littered throughout this discussion post and should be treated with the same respect.\n"

There's also the way Muramasa kept calling her an \"ajin\" last episode, which the subs translated as American (well, yankee) but in context basically means demi-human -- elves, dwarves, fairies, etc. Could have just been an insult and a way of poking fun at her name and ears, but with that name and those ears...\n\nPersonally I think it's never going to be directly addressed."

Wrong, the MC literally tramples Elf\u2019s feelings intentionally this latest episode for nothing more than he wanted to see how she\u2019d react. Lets take this serious topic where the girl pours her heart out to you and use it to get her hopes then crush her for the sake of a punch line. Yeah, real cute.\n\nI\u2019m on-board with the theory now. The MC is a huge piece of shit who is just using these girls and leading them on for laughs.

He has been for Sagiri from the start and only got close to Elf to try and learn from her. If anything, Elf is the one playing a malicious game. She knows he and Sagiri have a thing going on. She knows Sagiri is very fragile, she saw Sagiris reaction to Muramasas proposal. Elf has invited Muramasa to all of the events thus far, not MC. I dont see it.\n\n From his perspective, he has not seen Elf act the way she did when he called her Emily as much as the audience had. Clearly he is supposed to be dense, that is abundantly clear and a common criticism. I think that theory is just a really damn dumb theory, to be blunt. Its no surprise it comes from two failed analytics who degrade and belittle everything.\n\nIMO dont invite the kind of negativity those two stir up into your life, and you may just catch a real glimpse of an interesting point of view. The one you proposed is not interesting, its just ugly. "

Think that makes him a terrible character? Sure, I have no rebuke to that. Im not talking about the quality of the show, because that can be argued all day and im not in the market to sell the show to anyone. I will however engage in discussion about what actually took place in the show and I stand by the statement that the proposed theory is shit.\n\nIm not sure how he could be playing any of them considering he has never reached out in a meaningful way to any of them. He turned them both down, told them he loved someone else, and they both vowed to continue perusing him. Bad plot? Sure, thats subjective. I wont argue its not, but are those events what actually took place in the show? Certainly. Essentially you said the show is so boring you have to create a headcannon to continue watching. Well thats fine, but dont expect others to go for it. Maybe stop watching tropey bullshit in 2017? This is not a new trend. People know by now whether they want to see this content each season and it sells enough to where its not stopping soon. Its modern soap operas for young adults and it seems Western fans just cant grasp that. It sells each season, and its going to continue to. These shows with all their harem tropes are going absolutely nowhere.\n\nI dont think it takes an amazing individual in 2017 to point out how tropey or bad an anime is. Something Digibro could not even do for all his bluster in regards to insulting Eromanga Sensei. What for episode 8 he said its good but not good because he already doubled down on opinions he made before the shit ever came out and for episode 9 he called the episode pointless and irrelevant despite there being a confession from one character to another that is indeed relevant regardless of who he choose. Oh and Elf was ugly in her swimsuit I mean what an incredibly insightful intellectual."
