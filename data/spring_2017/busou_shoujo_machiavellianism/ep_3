She's managed to defeat almost all of the leaders, and she's done more than just stab a few of them. *When she sliced at the eyelids, I physically cringed...* Most shows don't cause that reaction from me, so I'm very impressed.\n\nInaba had a rather quick change of character, but the monologue from her was interesting, and the fact that she seemed to know Nomura as well was cool. Of course fight Amou wouldn't go so well, but I was surprised that the girl like Inaba would have such a basic sword to use (probably being so fast she underestimated ever needing a quality weapon). It may be just me, but I found the moment where Nomura pulled Inaba out of the way of Amou's attack to be...\n\n[Really cute!](#headpat)\n\nThe rest of the cast showing up and just being bulldozed really makes Amou a scary character. However, this new lady with the empty purple eyes is intriguing... She mentioned that she will take care of the students on the roof, and almost appearing out of nowhere, I'm curious as to if she will heal all the girls that were hurt/ killed. I guess we will find out next episode.\n\nI was **definitely not** expecting anything this good from this show, and I am now very excited for the next episode. Will this be the final confrontation between Nomura and Amou?\n\n[It's too good!](#comfortfood)\n\n**Fun thing I just noticed:** You can spell Amou's name using Nomura, leaving a N and R."

MC beats/accidently kisses/gropes girl, girl falls for MC because plot. It seemed fun so I personally just kept watching it, then episode 9 and this one came along and turned my view around. It's pretty good now and episode 9 was a nice twist due to the unexpected change."
