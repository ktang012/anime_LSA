LNs really ease the reader into the world and the characters with WIllem's inner monologue. Pretty much most of the issues of the show could be solved with just a tad slower pace.\n\nOkay, to the newest episode... What's a better way to start an episode than **reptile romance**. The doujins just write themselves. even more hilarious is how the kids seem really into it. They just are so [damn](http://i.imgur.com/Yp2ojnx.png)\n - [adorable](http://i.imgur.com/7DHK9EW.png). To think they are raised to suicide in battle...\n\nAlso, it's nice seeing a reminder [other](http://i.imgur.com/PjSz08W.png) species living in the world and a reminder that human face is *not* a normal thing to see at all.\n\nThe reunion was [really touching](http://i.imgur.com/XGGbTdd.png)!   [~~But Willem, shouldn't you mention some prior touching you did~~](http://i.imgur.com/bCpRwdn.png) Sorry, sorry... I mean, even [Nephren smiled](http://i.imgur.com/3KAxKwC.png)!\n\nPreview: next episode seems like some more city life with *some* [lighthearted](http://i.imgur.com/NBcY5C8.png) moments. \n\n[LN spoilers](/s \"looks like we'll be meeting Suwong soon, can't wait for that reunion\")\n\nEdit: How could I have forgotten [this one quote](http://i.imgur.com/TFJBFFFr.png)"

I don't really want to just give a dry, point form presentation of what SukaSuka has to offer. Instead, I would like to attempt to capture some of the core essence of the story, that you would be able to get some enjoyment out of reading this document.\n\nNote while most things were clearly outlined in the books, there are certain parts that are up to personal interpretation. I'm also following naming schemes of the official translation (of the official website), which differs from the fan translation of the LN.\n\nAlso, any lore and plot in the second series, SukaMoka, would not be covered in this document.\n\nAdditional note regarding some proper nouns and terms, in the novel, there are words written in kanji with either katakana or hiragana readings attached to it. The kanji meaning and the kana readings may not exactly fit, ie.  Holy Sword(kanji) = Carillon (katakana), I will outline both in the document as it will help with understanding.\n\nAnyways, tread carefully.\n\n**Very Heavy Spoilers Warning**\n\n[WIP Lore&Spoiler Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NpJFH2Z6xoOc48FqWH3zNiP7E_31edhtPRcpzhikbgs/edit?usp=sharing)"

The beast's essence, along with Willem's original memories&personality, have been sealed away, so that Willem's consciousness as a human can be retained. The book likened it to separating milk tea in the same cup into milk and tea. As for ren, she is a fairy, so she shouldn't be able to physically turn into beast-like form. However, the beast's essence immortalized her from within while retaining her appearance. And as of the end of book 5, there doesn't seem to be a method to remove the beast part, at least not explicitly.\")\n\nThe only English translation is fgilan's.

   "text": "This episode captures real well the feeling of waiting for someone you care about return from war.\n\nThe episode is filled with moments that are extremelly relatable to the idea of a person being MISSING that you got used to being around you, be it Willem's nightmares of losing everyone around him, the insomnia Willem seems to be suffering from or even Willem's silently escalating desperation that slowly grows bigger and bigger as the episode progresses. Willem can do nothing but wait and hope. Sure he tries to keep busy interacting with children he takes care of, going on trips to movies, taking care of chores and all, but he can't escape the uncertainty he feels, the unknown on whether everything will go alright.  In a sense, the viewer is taken on a ride with Willem because the viewer does not get to know the fates of the characters till Willem himself finds out. \n\nAt the same time as we are taken on an emotional journey with Willem, the show also continues the world building expanding upon characters and overall lore. \n\nThe show is really good in making children act and speak like actual children, which is somewhat rare in anime. Be it when they fangirl over a movie filming location or expect to grow up momentarily after drinking milk - it feels like something children would do. \n\nLikewise in terms of worldbuilding we had a lot of show-not-tell this episode showcasing the weird and unique culture of the post-human world, starting with movies, traditions and overall behavior of society, both darker and lighter sides of it. This episode really helps to set up a living breathing world. \n\nOverall all of the worldbuilding works as a nice distraction both for us and Willem, till it slowly ties together into his worries, leading perfectly into the episodes culmination where we get to see just how well Kareno Akira can play with readers/viewers feelings and do chilling mood whiplashes. Everything that has been building in the background explodes and Willem and the viewers can't keep it to themselves anymore. The scene set-up is perfect - not only it is raining, but Willem's mind also ties parts of the nightmare he had to the real world dejavu that strengthens his desperation and breakdown till a sigh of relief comes in form of a super-fast hug. For now everything is fine. For now, the loss of the fight did not mean the loss of lives. But it is only one of many fights to happen and only second Willem witnessed. And this kind of worry and fear will most likely haunt him every time they leave.\n\nThis is such a brilliant adaptation so far. We get a very well handled story of suffering and desperation of the one left behind to wait for other's return.  And in nice twist this is actually a fun gender role reversal too as it is usually the male character fighting and female character waiting. Willem's portrayal here and especially in the hug scene is strongly emotional which is quite unusual for male LN protagonist, who are usually portrayed as \"cool\" and voice of reason. Its unusual and refreshing. \n\nif anything this episode helps to establish how different this work is from traditional LNs. "

   "text": "I wasn't bothered by the slap because it really fit the moment.  Wilhem's hug was unexpected, way too long, and out of place.  The mission just failed because Chtolly didn't sacrifice herself.  I don't know if there were any casualties , but if there were, I'm sure there would be some pang of guilt (regardless if Chtolly should feel that way).  She wasn't going to go around proclaiming \"I'm so glad *I'm* alive\".  But Wilhem's hug would have the same effect.  She was stressed out, not ready for it, and likely amplified some complex feelings that she was having.  People tend to lash out at stuff like that.\n\n\nI also enjoyed the Tiat part of the episode.  Her mix of nervousness and excitement of the tuning process and her attempt to put on a brave face was simultaneously cute and heart-breaking. "
